Prototype?,Jan Bernheim,Political and Institutional Influences on the Use of Evidence in Public Health Policy. A Systematic Review,"[""Marco Liverani"", ""Benjamin Hawkins"", ""Justin O. Parkhurst""]","There is increasing recognition that the development of evidence-informed health policy is not only a technical problem of knowledge exchange or translation, but also a political challenge. Yet, while political scientists have long considered the nature of political systems, the role of institutional structures, and the political contestation of policy issues as central to understanding policy decisions, these issues remain largely unexplored by scholars of evidence-informed policy making.We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies that examined the influence of key features of political systems and institutional mechanisms on evidence use, and contextual factors that may contribute to the politicisation of health evidence. Eligible studies were identified through searches of seven health and social sciences databases, websites of relevant organisations, the British Library database, and manual searches of academic journals. Relevant findings were extracted using a uniform data extraction tool and synthesised by narrative review.56 studies were selected for inclusion. Relevant political and institutional aspects affecting the use of health evidence included the level of state centralisation and democratisation, the influence of external donors and organisations, the organisation and function of bureaucracies, and the framing of evidence in relation to social norms and values. However, our understanding of such influences remains piecemeal given the limited number of empirical analyses on this subject, the paucity of comparative works, and the limited consideration of political and institutional theory in these studies.This review highlights the need for a more explicit engagement with the political and institutional factors affecting the use of health evidence in decision-making. A more nuanced understanding of evidence use in health policy making requires both additional empirical studies of evidence use, and an engagement with theories and approaches beyond the current remit of public health or knowledge utilisation studies.","This said, the ""translation"" of scientific evidence into health policy is a complex process that is subject to inertia and cultural impediments (#AUTHOR_TAG, Hawkins, and Parkhurst 2013).","['This said, the ""translation"" of scientific evidence into health policy is a complex process that is subject to inertia and cultural impediments (#AUTHOR_TAG, Hawkins, and Parkhurst 2013).', 'The eventual acceptance of medical ethical developments after prolonged professional and political opposition is not without historical precedents, for example, contraception, assisted procreation, and abortion.', 'Just as the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) so far rejects legal euthanasia (Materstvedt et al. 2012), the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) has opposed abortion for many decades.', 'However, in 1998 it took the position that all women must have access to professionally performed abortion.', 'FIGO now states ""neither society, nor members of the health care team responsible for counseling women, have the right to impose their religious or cultural convictions regarding abortion on those whose attitudes are different"" (FIGO 2013, 104) and concludes that ""the Committee recommend[s] that after appropriate counselling, a woman [has] the right to have access to medical or surgical induced abortion, and that the health care service [has] an obligation to provide such services as safely as possible"" (FIGO 2013, 105;Erdman et al. 2013).', 'But also here, in addition to philosophical motives, pragmatic motives have been operating: Another important objective of FIGO was to lift abortion out of clandestine illegal activity, to let it be performed in medically correct conditions and so ensure that abortion is safe and accessible.', 'Similarly, illegal clandestine end-of-life practices, performed without peer control, as documented in Belgium before the euthanasia law and elsewhere (Kuhse et al. 1997;Deliens et al. 2000;Mitchell and Owens 2003) can be considered more worrying than even imperfectly regulated legal euthanasia.', 'Evidently, bioethical evolutions come about more readily when ethical and pragmatic motives coincide and operate synergistically.']",0,"['This said, the ""translation"" of scientific evidence into health policy is a complex process that is subject to inertia and cultural impediments (#AUTHOR_TAG, Hawkins, and Parkhurst 2013).']"

A Review of the Criteria and Evidence in the Netherlands, Belgium, Oregon, and Switzerland","["" Lewis""]","Some form of assisted dying (voluntary euthanasia and/or assisted suicide) is lawful in the Netherlands, Belgium, Oregon, and Switzerland. In order to be lawful in these jurisdictions, a valid request must precede the provision of assistance to die. Non-adherence to the criteria for valid requests for assisted dying may be a trigger for civil and/or criminal liability, as well as disciplinary sanctions where the assistor is a medical professional. In this article, we review the criteria and evidence in respect of requests for assisted dying in the Netherlands, Belgium, Oregon, and Switzerland, with the aim of establishing whether individuals who receive assisted dying do so on the basis of valid requests. We conclude that the evidence suggests that individuals who receive assisted dying in the four jurisdictions examined do so on the basis of valid requests and third parties who assist death do not act unlawfully. However, further research on the elements that may undermine the validity of requests for assisted dying is warranted. More research on the reasons why requests for assisted dying are refused is also desirable.","The #AUTHOR_TAG and Black (2013) article exhaustively reviews all extant data in ""permissive"" countries on reported cases of granted and refused assisted dying","['The #AUTHOR_TAG and Black (2013) article exhaustively reviews all extant data in ""permissive"" countries on reported cases of granted and refused assisted dying']",4,"['The #AUTHOR_TAG and Black (2013) article exhaustively reviews all extant data in ""permissive"" countries on reported cases of granted and refused assisted dying']"

Rurup"", ""Luc Deliens""]","Belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002. Physicians must report each euthanasia case to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee. This study examines which end-of-life decisions (ELDs) Belgian physicians label 'euthanasia', which ELDs they think should be reported and the physician characteristics associated with correct labelling of euthanasia cases, the awareness that they should be reported and the reporting of them.Five hypothetical cases of ELDs: intensified pain alleviation, palliative/terminal sedation, euthanasia with neuromuscular relaxants, euthanasia with morphine and life-ending without patient request were presented in a cross-sectional survey of 914 physicians in Belgium in 2009.About 19% of physicians did not label a euthanasia case with neuromuscular relaxants 'euthanasia', 27% did not know that it should be reported. Most physicians labelled a euthanasia case with morphine 'intensification of pain and symptom treatment' (39%) or 'palliative/terminal sedation' (37%); 21% of physicians labelled this case 'euthanasia'. Cases describing other ELDs were sometimes also labelled 'euthanasia'. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of labelling a euthanasia case correctly were: living in Flanders, being informed about the euthanasia law and having a positive attitude towards societal control over euthanasia. Whether a physician correctly labelled the euthanasia cases strongly determined their reporting knowledge and intentions.There is no consensus among physicians about the labelling of euthanasia and other ELDs, and about which cases must be reported. Mislabelling of ELDs could impede societal control over euthanasia. The provision of better information to physicians appears to be necessary.","Also because too many cases were not reported to the Control and Evaluation Commission, It was concluded that there is more need for more continued education of Belgian physicians (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2012).","['In 2007, in 20 percent of cases that were technically classified as euthanasia by the investigators of death certificate studies (though not necessarily perceived as euthanasia by the surveyed practitioner and not euthanasia for the law 7 ) no colleague was reported to have been consulted, as legally required for euthanasia (Chambaere et al. 2010a).', 'Also because too many cases were not reported to the Control and Evaluation Commission, It was concluded that there is more need for more continued education of Belgian physicians (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2012).', 'It has been alleged that some hospitals there might have been an exceptional case of euthanasia that was carried out in a manner that was compliant with legal requirements, but performed in an impersonal and routine way (e.g., personal communication to author JB by Bert Vanderhaeghen, a university hospital chaplain).', 'This would be contrary to the view of euthanasia as the ultimate culmination of a deep caregiver-patient relationship (colloque singulier).', 'If ""perfunctory euthanasia"" became more than highly exceptional and if any occurs and the public developed an impression of euthanasia being undertaken in a casual or uncaring way, this would constitute a real practical slippery slope phenomenon.', 'It would likely erode confidence in medicine and discredit euthanasia.', 'Such cases are have not given rise to complaints or prosecutions, and probably so rare that they have not affected public satisfaction with the Belgian model. 8', 'At any rate, there is no evidence of any shift to casual or uncaring euthanasia.']",2,"['In 2007, in 20 percent of cases that were technically classified as euthanasia by the investigators of death certificate studies (though not necessarily perceived as euthanasia by the surveyed practitioner and not euthanasia for the law 7 ) no colleague was reported to have been consulted, as legally required for euthanasia (Chambaere et al. 2010a).', 'Also because too many cases were not reported to the Control and Evaluation Commission, It was concluded that there is more need for more continued education of Belgian physicians (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2012).', 'It has been alleged that some hospitals there might have been an exceptional case of euthanasia that was carried out in a manner that was compliant with legal requirements, but performed in an impersonal and routine way (e.g., personal communication to author JB by Bert Vanderhaeghen, a university hospital chaplain).']"

Research design: Questionnaires were sent to a sample of 6860 physicians who had reported a death in 2005 (response 78%). Previously, 3 similar studies were done at 5-year intervals. The total number of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide cases was estimated using a ""gold standard"" definition: death was-according to the physician-the result of the use of drugs at the explicit request of the patient with the explicit goal of hastening death (denominator). The Euthanasia Review Committees provided the number of reported cases (numerator). Results: The reporting rate of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide increased from 18% in 1990, 41% in 1995, and 54% in 2001 to 80% in 2005. The reporting rate in the subgroup of euthanasia with recommended drugs (barbiturates and muscle relaxants) was 73% in 1995, 71% in 2001, and 99% in 2005. The reporting rate of euthanasia with nonrecommended drugs (eg, opioids) was below 3% in 1995, 2001, and 2005. Unreported euthanasia differed also from reported euthanasia in the fact that physicians less often labeled their act as euthanasia. Conclusions: Euthanasia with nonrecommended drugs is almost never reported.

Methods: All general practitioners in 18 of the 23 Dutch general practitioner districts received a written questionnaire in which they were asked to describe the most recent request for EAS they received. Results: A total of 3614 general practitioners responded to the questionnaire (response rate, 60%). Of all explicit requests for EAS, 44% resulted in EAS. In the other cases the patient died before the performance (13%) or finalization of the decision making (13%), the patient withdrew the request (13%), or the physician refused the request (12%). Patients' most prominent symptoms were ""feeling bad,"" ""tiredness,"" and ""lack of appetite."" The most frequently mentioned reasons for requesting EAS were ""pointless suffering,"" ""loss of dignity,"" and ""weakness."" The patients' situation met the official requirements for accepted practice best in requests that resulted in EAS and least in refused requests. A lesser degree of competence and less unbearable and hopeless suffering had the strongest associations with the refusal of a request. Conclusions: The complexity of EAS decision making is reflected in the fact that besides granting and refusing a request, 3 other situations could be distinguished. The decisions physicians make, the reasons they have for their decisions, and the way they arrived at their decisions seem to be based on patient evaluations.

Little is known about the frequency and characteristics of end-of-life decisions in this population, nor about the relation with clinical and patients' characteristics. METHODS: A death-certificate study was done for all deaths of neonates and infants in the whole of Flanders over a 12 month period (August, 1999, to July, 2000). We sent an anonymous questionnaire by mail to the attending physician for each of the 292 children who died under the age of 1 year. Information on patients was obtained from national registers. An attitude study was done for all physicians who attended at least one death during the study period. FINDINGS: 253 (87%) of the 292 questionnaires were returned, and 121 (69%) of the 175 physicians involved completed the attitude questions. An end-of-life decision was possible in 194 (77%; 95% CI 70.4-82.4) of the 253 deaths studied, and such a decision was made in 143 cases (57%; 48.9-64.0). Lethal drugs were administered in 15 cases among 117 early neonatal deaths and in two cases among 77 later deaths (13%vs 3%; p=0.018). The attitude study showed that 95 (79%; 70.1-85.5) of the 121 physicians thought that their professional duty sometimes includes the prevention of unnecessary suffering by hastening death and 69 (58%; 48.1-66.5) of 120 supported legalisation of life termination in some cases. INTERPRETATION: Death of neonates and infants is commonly preceded by an end-of-life decision. The type of decision varied substantially according to the age of the child.

Interviews were conducted at least 6 months after the refusal.A wish to die remained in all patients after refusal, although it sometimes diminished. In most cases patient and physician stopped discussing this wish, and none of the physicians had discussed plans for the future with the patient or evaluated the patient's situation after their refusal. Physicians were aware of patients' continued wish to die.Patients who are refused EAS may subsequently be silent about a wish to die without abandoning it. Open communication about wishes to die is important, even outside the context of EAS, because if people feel unable to talk about them, their quality of life may be further diminished.Follow up appointments after refusal could give patients the opportunity to discuss their feelings and physicians to support them.Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Design In-depth interviews with a topic list. Setting Patients' homes and physicians' offices. Participants 10 patients who explicitly requested euthanasia but whose request was not granted or performed and eight physicians of these patients; and eight physicians of patients who had requested euthanasia but had died before the request had been granted or performed or had died after the request was refused by the physician or after the patient had withdrawn his or her request. Results Not all patients who requested euthanasia thought their suffering was unbearable, although they had a lasting wish to die. Patients and physicians seemed to agree about this. In cases in which patients said they suffered unbearably there was less agreement about what constitutes unbearable suffering; patients put more emphasis on psychosocial suffering, such as dependence and deterioration, whereas physicians referred more often to physical suffering. In some cases the physician thought that the suffering was not unbearable because the patient's behaviour seemed incompatible with unbearable suffering-for instance, because the patient was still reading books. Conclusions Patients do not always think that their suffering is unbearable, even if they have a lasting wish to die. Physicians seem to have a narrower perspective on unbearable suffering than patients and than case law suggests. In an attempt to solve the problem of different perspectives, physicians should take into account the different aspects of suffering as described in the literature and a framework for assessing the suffering of patients who ask for euthanasia.","Dutch qualitative research has shown that some people who considered ""their life completed"" and requested euthanasia did not themselves call their suffering ""unbearable"" (e.g., they could still read a book or watch television), yet did not want to go on living in their condition (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009).","['Loss of dignity and independence, affliction with a number of chronic incurable ailments (""chronic multiorgan failure""), together with a sense of having lived one\'s life can constitute a state of existence that is not acceptable to the person concerned, although it may not be ""objectively"" unbearable.', 'Dutch qualitative research has shown that some people who considered ""their life completed"" and requested euthanasia did not themselves call their suffering ""unbearable"" (e.g., they could still read a book or watch television), yet did not want to go on living in their condition (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009).', 'Such situations can be excruciating, irreversible, and hopeless.', 'Euthanasia is then not legal because the diseases are not lethal.', 'It is also problematic that some consider such requests to be the result of a mental disorder that makes the applicant incompetent or confuse profound sadness with clinical depression (Szmukler 2014).']",4,"['Dutch qualitative research has shown that some people who considered ""their life completed"" and requested euthanasia did not themselves call their suffering ""unbearable"" (e.g., they could still read a book or watch television), yet did not want to go on living in their condition (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009).']"

Prototype?,Jan Bernheim,"MANAGING INTENTIONS: THE END-OF-LIFE ADMINISTRATION OF ANALGESICS AND SEDATIVES, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SLOW EUTHANASIA","[""CHARLES DOUGLAS"", ""IAN KERRIDGE"", ""RACHEL ANKENY""]","There has been much debate regarding the 'double-effect' of sedatives and analgesics administered at the end-of-life, and the possibility that health professionals using these drugs are performing 'slow euthanasia.' On the one hand analgesics and sedatives can do much to relieve suffering in the terminally ill. On the other hand, they can hasten death. According to a standard view, the administration of analgesics and sedatives amounts to euthanasia when the drugs are given with an intention to hasten death. In this paper we report a small qualitative study based on interviews with 8 Australian general physicians regarding their understanding of intention in the context of questions about voluntary euthanasia, assisted suicide and particularly the use of analgesic and sedative infusions (including the possibility of voluntary or non-voluntary 'slow euthanasia'). We found a striking ambiguity and uncertainty regarding intentions amongst doctors interviewed. Some were explicit in describing a 'grey' area between palliation and euthanasia, or a continuum between the two. Not one of the respondents was consistent in distinguishing between a foreseen death and an intended death. A major theme was that 'slow euthanasia' may be more psychologically acceptable to doctors than active voluntary euthanasia by bolus injection, partly because the former would usually only result in a small loss of 'time' for patients already very close to death, but also because of the desirable ambiguities surrounding causation and intention when an infusion of analgesics and sedatives is used. The empirical and philosophical implications of these findings are discussed.","The distinction between the intention of life-ending and compassionate intensification of symptom treatment is often blurred (#AUTHOR_TAG, Kerridge, and Ankeny 2008).","['LAWER, as detected by ""intention,"" is found mainly in Belgium (van der Heide et al. 2003;Chambaere et al. 2010a), Australia (Kuhse et al. 1997), and New Zealand (Mitchell and Owens 2003).', 'In most other countries, physicians would likely deny a wish to hasten death and a similar act would probably be classified as intensified alleviation of pain and symptoms or palliative sedation (van der Heide et al. 2003;Seale 2009).', 'The distinction between the intention of life-ending and compassionate intensification of symptom treatment is often blurred (#AUTHOR_TAG, Kerridge, and Ankeny 2008).', 'A reasonable hypothesis is that actual practices are not so different and that these are countries where the culture is more conducive to using the doctrine of double effect (McIntyre 2011).', 'Most importantly, since 1998, the incidence of LAWER has halved in Belgium since the legalisation of euthanasia (Bilsen et al. 2009;Chambaere et al. 2010a), which should allay this concern of a practical slippery slope.', 'Yet one cannot exclude a few objectionable acts, and LAWER, just as palliative sedation, can be problematic when there is no advance directive.', 'An interesting phenomenon is that the liberalisation of euthanasia in the Low Countries seems to have promoted a novel orthodoxy in end-of-life practices and decreased the tolerance for compassionate paternalism when a patient is agonising.', ""In 1934 Dr. Dawson, King George V's personal physician, seems to have had no qualms recording that, in the face of respiratory failure and in the interest of his patient's dignity, he had nudged him over the edge with opiates (Ramsay 1994)."", 'But the pendulum between ""autonomism"" and paternalism may be swinging back: According to some, the current dogma of absolute patient autonomy has overshot and beneficent paternalism at the end of life needs to be reappraised (Roeland et al. 2014).']",1,"['The distinction between the intention of life-ending and compassionate intensification of symptom treatment is often blurred (#AUTHOR_TAG, Kerridge, and Ankeny 2008).']"

Eefsting""]","Although advance directives may seem useful instruments in decision-making regarding incompetent patients, their validity in cases of dementia has been a much debated subject and little is known about their effectiveness in practice. This paper assesses the contribution of advance directives to decision-making in the care of people with dementia, with a special focus on non-treatment directives and directives for euthanasia.The relevant problems from the ethical debate on advance directives in cases of dementia are summarized and we discuss how these relate to what is known from empirical research on the validity and effectiveness of advance directives in the clinical practice of dementia care.The ethical debate focuses essentially on how to respond to the current wishes of a patient with dementia if these contradict the patient's wishes contained in an advance directive. The (very limited) empirical data show that the main factors in medical decision-making in such cases is not the patient's perspective but the medical judgment of the physician and the influence of relatives. Insight into the experiences and wishes of people with dementia regarding advance directives is totally lacking in empirical research.Ethics and actual practice are two ""different worlds"" when it comes to approaching advance directives in cases of dementia. It is clear, however, that the use of advance directives in practice remains problematic, above all in cases of advance euthanasia directives, but to a lesser extent also when non-treatment directives are involved. Although generally considered valid, their effectiveness seems marginal. Further empirical research into the (potential) value of advance directives in dementia care is recommended.",Whether advance directives of non-treatment or termination of life can apply also for dementia is hotly debated (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2010).,"['The Belgian law requires competency at the time that euthanasia is provided.', 'Only in cases of irreversible total unconsciousness (e.g., by brain injury) can witnessed advance directives in writing for euthanasia be honoured.', 'Therefore, such advance directives cannot legally be honoured for still conscious patients who because of, for example, a brain tumour or dementia can be suspected not to be fully competent to confirm their previous wish.', 'Thus the suffering caused by the intolerable prospect of future loss of higher cognitive capacity can bring people whose life could still have been enjoyable for quite some time to opt for a premature death (Hevesi 2008;Davis 2014). 9', 'Whether advance directives of non-treatment or termination of life can apply also for dementia is hotly debated (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2010).', 'The Belgian Senate heard testimonies also on this controversial issue in 2013.', 'Lawmakers and health professionals are discussing not so much whether the law needs to be extended, but what effective safeguards can be devised.']",1,['Whether advance directives of non-treatment or termination of life can apply also for dementia is hotly debated (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2010).']

This study assesses quality of consultations in Flanders and Brussels and compares these between LEIF and non-LEIF consultants.A questionnaire was sent in 2009 to a random sample of 3,006 physicians in Belgium from specialties likely involved in the care of dying patients. Several questions about the last euthanasia request of one of their patients were asked. As LEIF serves the Flemish speaking community (i.e. region of Flanders and the bilingual Brussels Capital Region) and no similar counterpart is present in Wallonia, analyses were limited to Flemish speaking physicians in Flanders and Brussels.Response was 34%. Of the 244 physicians who indicated having received a euthanasia request seventy percent consulted a second physician in their last request; in 30% this was with a LEIF physician. Compared to non-LEIF physicians, LEIF physicians were more often not a colleague (69% vs 42%) and not a co-attending physician (89% vs 66%). They tended to more often discuss the request with the attending physician (100% vs 95%) and with the family (76% vs 69%), and also more frequently helped the attending physician with performing euthanasia (44% vs 24%). No significant differences were found in the extent to which they talked to the patient (96% vs 93%) and examined the patient file (94% vs 97%).In cases of explicit euthanasia requests in Belgium, the consultation procedure of another physician by the attending physician is not optimal and can be improved. Training and putting at disposal consultants through forums such as LEIF seems able to improve this situation. Adding stipulations in the law about the necessary competencies and tasks of consulting physicians may additionally incite improvement. Irrespective of whether euthanasia is a legal practice within a country, similar services may prove useful to also improve quality of consultations in various other difficult end-of-life decision-making situations.",The value of specific training for the quality of second physician consultation was recently documented (#AUTHOR_TAG at al. 2014).,"['The question is unresolved whether physicians who, as the law requires, give a second opinion when a request of euthanasia is processed need to be ad hoc registered specialists, ""euthanasia doctors"" as it were.', 'In the Netherlands, the Royal Society of Medicine (Koninklijke Nederlandse Maatschappij voor de Geneeskunde, KNMG) appoints Support and Consultation for Euthanasia (SCEN) physicians for this task, which is also a condition for remuneration (Van Wesemael et al. 2009a).', 'Should there be specialised training in Belgium for consultancy about euthanasia requests?', 'This is what LEIF do and propose, arguing (1) that many physicians do not know the law and end-of-life care well enough to give expert advice and (2) that too many valid and repeated requests for euthanasia in practice are still turned down.', 'Or should all physicians be eligible for this role, as the Federation Palliative Care Flanders (FPCFl) favours on the basis of its commitment to empowerment and continuity of care in the integral palliative care model?', 'LEIF and the FPCFl are at loggerheads on this issue.', 'Whatever will be decided, the registered consultant physicians will have to provide proof of expertise and be committed to integral end-of-life care.', 'The value of specific training for the quality of second physician consultation was recently documented (#AUTHOR_TAG at al. 2014).']",2,"['The question is unresolved whether physicians who, as the law requires, give a second opinion when a request of euthanasia is processed need to be ad hoc registered specialists, ""euthanasia doctors"" as it were.', 'In the Netherlands, the Royal Society of Medicine (Koninklijke Nederlandse Maatschappij voor de Geneeskunde, KNMG) appoints Support and Consultation for Euthanasia (SCEN) physicians for this task, which is also a condition for remuneration (Van Wesemael et al. 2009a).', 'Should there be specialised training in Belgium for consultancy about euthanasia requests?', 'This is what LEIF do and propose, arguing (1) that many physicians do not know the law and end-of-life care well enough to give expert advice and (2) that too many valid and repeated requests for euthanasia in practice are still turned down.', 'The value of specific training for the quality of second physician consultation was recently documented (#AUTHOR_TAG at al. 2014).']"

The objective of the Task Force is to assess the degree of palliative care development in the European Region as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). The Task Force is a collaboration between EAPC, the International Observatory on End of Life Care, Help the Hospices and the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care. The University of Navarra have collaborated in the dissemination of results and is involved in further developments of this group. Four studies, each with different working methods, made up the study protocol: a literature review, a review of all the existing palliative care directories in Europe, a qualitative ;Eurobarometer' survey and a quantitative ;Facts Questionnaire' survey. The work of the Task Force covers the entire WHO European Region of 52 countries. In this article we present a comparative study on the development of palliative care in Europe, drawing on all four elements of the study. Different models of service delivery have been developed and implemented throughout the countries of Europe. For example, in addition to the UK, the countries of Germany, Austria, Poland and Italy have a well-developed and extensive network of hospices. The model for mobile teams or hospital support teams has been adopted in a number of countries, most notably in France. Day Centres are a development that is characteristic of the UK with hundreds of these services currently in operation. The number of beds per million inhabitants ranges between 45-75 beds in the most advanced European countries, to only a few beds in others. Estimates on the number of physicians working full time in palliative care are shown. The countries with the highest development of palliative care in their respective subregions as measured in terms of ratio of services per one million inhabitants are: Western Europe - UK (15); Central and Eastern Europe - Poland (9); Commonwealth of Independent States - Armenia (8).

Questionnaire consisted of three parts. In first part responded were requested to provide demographic information. In second part the respondents were asked to provide information concerning their religion or world view through several questions enquiring after religious or ideological affiliation, religious or ideological self-definition, view on life after death, image of God, spirituality, importance of rituals in their life, religious practice, and importance of religion in life. The third part consisted of a list of attitudinal statements regarding different treatment decisions in advanced disease on which the respondents had to give their opinion using a five-point Likert scale.99 physician responded.WE WERE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH FOUR CLUSTERS: Church-going physicians, infrequently church-going physicians, atheists and doubters. We found that like the Belgian general public, many Flemish palliative care physicians concoct their own religious or ideological identity and feel free to drift away from traditional religious and ideological authorities.In our research we noted that physicians who have a strong belief in God and express their faith through participation in prayer and rituals, tend to be more critical toward euthanasia.

The patient must be in a medically futile condition and of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated, resulting from a serious and incurable disorder caused by illness or accident. Between 2005 and 2007, 4 patients (3 in Antwerp and 1 in Lige) expressed their will for organ donation after their request for euthanasia was granted. Patients were aged 43 to 50 years and had a debilitating neurologic disease, either after severe cerebrovascular accident or primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Ethical boards requested complete written scenario with informed consent of donor and relatives, clear separation between euthanasia and organ procurement procedure, and all procedures to be performed by senior staff members and nursing staff on a voluntary basis. The euthanasia procedure was performed by three independent physicians in the operating room. After clinical diagnosis of cardiac death, organ procurement was performed by femoral vessel cannulation or quick laparotomy. In 2 patients, the liver, both kidneys, and pancreatic islets (one case) were procured and transplanted; in the other 2 patients, there was additional lung procurement and transplantation. Transplant centers were informed of the nature of the case and the elements of organ procurement. There was primary function of all organs. The involved physicians and transplant teams had the well-discussed opinion that this strong request for organ donation after euthanasia could not be waived. A clear separation between the euthanasia request, the euthanasia procedure, and the organ procurement procedure is necessary.","Belgium is also the first country where, under strict conditions, patients with irreversible catastrophic neurological conditions whose request of euthanasia has been granted can can give added meaning to their life and death by directing to donate their (intact) organs for multiple transplantations, according to Eurotransplant guidelines (Eurotransplant 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009, Van Raemdonck et al. 2011Bruno et al. 2011).","['Belgium is also the first country where, under strict conditions, patients with irreversible catastrophic neurological conditions whose request of euthanasia has been granted can can give added meaning to their life and death by directing to donate their (intact) organs for multiple transplantations, according to Eurotransplant guidelines (Eurotransplant 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009, Van Raemdonck et al. 2011Bruno et al. 2011).']",4,"['Belgium is also the first country where, under strict conditions, patients with irreversible catastrophic neurological conditions whose request of euthanasia has been granted can can give added meaning to their life and death by directing to donate their (intact) organs for multiple transplantations, according to Eurotransplant guidelines (Eurotransplant 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009, Van Raemdonck et al. 2011Bruno et al. 2011).']"

The new book emphasises recent legal developments and new research, and has been expanded to include a full treatment of Belgium, where since 2002 euthanasia has also become legal. The book also includes descriptions written by local specialists of the legal situation and what is known about actual practice in a number of other European countries (England and Wales, France, Italy, Scandinavia, Spain, Switzerland). The book strives for as complete and dispassionate a description of the situation as possible. It covers in detail: - the substantive law applicable to euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, withholding and withdrawing treatment, use of pain relief in potentially lethal doses, palliative and terminal sedation, and termination of life without a request (in particular in the case of newborn babies); -the process of legal development that has led to the current state of the law; -the system of legal control and its operation in practice; -the results of empirical research concerning actual medical practice. A concluding part deals with some general questions that arise out of the material presented: Is the legalisation of euthanasia an example of the decline of law or should it, on the contrary, be seen as part and parcel of the increasing juridification of the doctor-patient relationship? Does the Dutch experience with legalised euthanasia support the idea of a 'slippery slope' toward a situation in which life-especially of the more vulnerable members of society-is less effectively protected?

In addition to medical training and experience, religiosity, locus of control and patient characteristics (eg, patient age, pain levels, number of euthanasia requests) are known influencing factors. Previous research tends toward basic designs reporting on attitudes in the context of just one or two potentially influencing factors; we aimed to test the comparative importance of a larger range of variables in a sample of nursing trainees and non-nursing controls. One hundred and fifty-one undergraduate students (early-stage nursing training, late-stage nursing training and non-nursing controls) were approached on a UK university campus and asked to complete a self-report questionnaire. Participants were of mixed gender and were on average 25.5 years old. No significant differences in attitude were found between nursing and non-nursing students. There was a significant positive correlation between higher religiosity and positive attitude toward euthanasia (r=0.19, p<0.05) and a significant negative relationship between internal locus of control and positive attitude toward PAS (r=-0.263, p<0.01). Multivariate analyses revealed differing predictor models for attitudes towards euthanasia and PAS, and confirm the importance of individual differences in determining these attitudes. The unexpected direction of association between religiosity and attitudes may reflect a broader cultural shift in attitudes since earlier research in this area. Furthermore, these findings suggest it possible that experience, more than training itself, may be a bigger influence on attitudinal differences in healthcare professionals.","Perhaps surprisingly, in a survey of British students there was a significant positive correlation between religious belief and a positive attitude towards euthanasia, a finding suggesting a cultural shift to #AUTHOR_TAG and Hulbert-Williams (2013).","['This debate can be informed by empirical data.', 'As in the United Kingdom (Seale 2010) and other countries (B�_low et al. 2012), in Belgium practicing religious palliative care physicians are more critical of euthanasia than others (Broeckaert et al. 2009).', 'Perhaps surprisingly, in a survey of British students there was a significant positive correlation between religious belief and a positive attitude towards euthanasia, a finding suggesting a cultural shift to #AUTHOR_TAG and Hulbert-Williams (2013).', 'Europe-wide comparative research shows that personal worldview does have some influence, but that the national cultural and legal context counts for much more.', 'In countries where euthanasia is legal (""permissive"" countries), religious physicians are much more favourable towards euthanasia than in countries where it is not, and non-believers in the latter countries tend to report higher levels of opposition (Miccinesi et al. 2005;Cohen et al. 2008).', 'It appears, therefore, that the surrounding culture strongly influences personal views, and perhaps euthanasia legislation changes the culture.', ""In permissive countries the main determinants of physicians' willingness to perform euthanasia are not physician-but patient-related: The clinical condition of the patients and their wishes are foremost."", 'The predominance of patient interests over physician views is of itself an important ethical stance (Hunt 1994).']",1,"['Perhaps surprisingly, in a survey of British students there was a significant positive correlation between religious belief and a positive attitude towards euthanasia, a finding suggesting a cultural shift to #AUTHOR_TAG and Hulbert-Williams (2013).']"

This leads us to suggest that there may be a 4-dimensional state sum model for quantum gravity based on relativistic spin networks which parallels the construction of 3-dimensional quantum gravity from ordinary spin networks.Comment: 10 pages, amstex, some errors corrected, more reference","They were first defined a decade ago [6,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['Spin foam models are an attempt to produce a theory of quantum gravity starting from a discrete, path integral-like approach.', 'They were first defined a decade ago [6,#AUTHOR_TAG].', ""More recently, we have seen significant progress toward extraction of their semiclassical behavior and its favorable comparison to the expected weak field limit of gravity, starting with Rovelli and collaborators' calculation of the graviton propagator [30,34]."", 'Unfortunately, further calculations have revealed that the standard spin foam model due to Barrett and Crane produced incorrect results for some of the propagator matrix elements [3,4].', 'This result has motivated several proposals to replace the Barrett-Crane (BC) spin foam vertex amplitude [10] for quantum gravity.', 'The first proposal, by Engle, Pereira and Rovelli (EPR) [20,21], aimed also to identify the spin foam boundary state space with that of loop quantum gravity spin networks; this model is also referred to as the ""flipped"" vertex model.', 'Another proposal, by Livine and Speziale [27,28], used SU (2)-coherent states to define the spin foam amplitudes and reproduced the EPR proposal up to an edge normalization factor.', 'Finally, a paper by Freidel and Krasnov [18,22], suggested that the EPR model corresponds to a topological theory related to gravity and proposed a generalization thereof corresponding to gravity itself (the FK model).', 'The present paper, along with most previous work, concerns only the Riemannian signature models of gravity.']",0,"['Spin foam models are an attempt to produce a theory of quantum gravity starting from a discrete, path integral-like approach.', 'They were first defined a decade ago [6,#AUTHOR_TAG].', ""More recently, we have seen significant progress toward extraction of their semiclassical behavior and its favorable comparison to the expected weak field limit of gravity, starting with Rovelli and collaborators' calculation of the graviton propagator [30,34]."", 'Unfortunately, further calculations have revealed that the standard spin foam model due to Barrett and Crane produced incorrect results for some of the propagator matrix elements [3,4].', 'This result has motivated several proposals to replace the Barrett-Crane (BC) spin foam vertex amplitude [10] for quantum gravity.', 'The first proposal, by Engle, Pereira and Rovelli (EPR) [20,21], aimed also to identify the spin foam boundary state space with that of loop quantum gravity spin networks; this model is also referred to as the ""flipped"" vertex model.', 'Another proposal, by Livine and Speziale [27,28], used SU (2)-coherent states to define the spin foam amplitudes and reproduced the EPR proposal up to an edge normalization factor.', 'Finally, a paper by Freidel and Krasnov [18,22], suggested that the EPR model corresponds to a topological theory related to gravity and proposed a generalization thereof corresponding to gravity itself (the FK model).', 'The present paper, along with most previous work, concerns only the Riemannian signature models of gravity.']"

Starting from the Kauffman bracket model for the Jones polynomial and the diagrammatic Temperley-Lieb algebra, higher-order polynomial invariants of links are constructed and combined to form the 3-manifold invariants. The methods in this book are based on a recoupling theory for the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This recoupling theory is a q-deformation of the SU(2) spin networks of Roger Penrose. The recoupling theory is developed in a purely combinatorial and elementary manner. Calculations are based on a reformulation of the Kirillov-Reshetikhin shadow world, leading to expressions for all the invariants in terms of state summations on 2-cell complexes. Extensive tables of the invariants are included. Manifolds in these tables are recognized by surgery presentations and by means of 3-gems (graph encoded 3-manifolds) in an approach pioneered by Sostenes Lins.

Covering representations of U(sl(2)), quantum sl(2), the quantum trace and color representations, and the Turaev-Viro invariant, this work is useful to graduate students and professionals. The classic subject of representations of U(sl(2)) is equivalent to the physicistsÕ theory of quantum angular momentum. This material is developed in an elementary way using spin-networks and the Temperley-Lieb algebra to organize computations that have posed difficulties in earlier treatments of the subject. The emphasis is on the 6j-symbols and the identities among them, especially the Biedenharn-Elliott and orthogonality identities. The chapter on the quantum group Ub-3.0 qb0(sl(2)) develops the representation theory in strict analogy with the classical case, wherein the authors interpret the Kauffman bracket and the associated quantum spin-networks algebraically. The authors then explore instances where the quantum parameter q is a root of unity, which calls for a representation theory of a decidedly different flavor. The theory in this case is developed, modulo the trace zero representations, in order to arrive at a finite theory suitable for topological applications. The Turaev-Viro invariant for 3-manifolds is defined combinatorially using the theory developed in the preceding chapters. Since the background from the classical, quantum, and quantum root of unity cases has been explained thoroughly, the definition of this invariant is completely contained and justified within the text.","The overall spin network conventions and normalizations used in this paper are those of [#AUTHOR_TAG,24].","['The overall spin network conventions and normalizations used in this paper are those of [#AUTHOR_TAG,24].', 'Their precise relation to SU (2)-tensor contractions is presented in detail in the Appendix of [14].', 'Note that the intermediate spin 3']",5,"['The overall spin network conventions and normalizations used in this paper are those of [#AUTHOR_TAG,24].']"

Specifically, we consider three-dimensional SU(2) pure Yang-Mills as an accessible yet non-trivial case in which the gauge group is non-abelian. Using methods developed recently in the context of spin foam quantum gravity, we derive an algorithm for efficiently computing the dual amplitude and describe Metropolis moves for sampling the dual ensemble. We relate our algorithms to prior work in non-abelian dual computations of Hari Dass and his collaborators, addressing several problems that have been left open. We report results of spin expectation value computations over a range of lattice sizes and couplings that are in agreement with our conventional lattice computations.

We carefully describe the measure involved in terms of invariant variables and develop new technics in order to study their asymptotics. Using these technics we compute the asymptotics of the various Euclidean and Lorentzian 6j-symbols. Finally we compute the asymptotic expansion of the 10j symbol which is shown to be non-oscillating in agreement with a recent result of Baez et al.

The concept of `spin foam' is intended to serve as a similar picture for the quantum geometry of spacetime. In general, a spin network is a graph with edges labelled by representations and vertices labelled by intertwining operators. Similarly, a spin foam is a 2-dimensional complex with faces labelled by representations and edges labelled by intertwining operators. In a `spin foam model' we describe states as linear combinations of spin networks and compute transition amplitudes as sums over spin foams.

If u is a cover of a superstring of y then u is a seed of y. Covers and seeds are two formalisations of quasiperiodicity, and there exist linear-time algorithms for computing all the covers and seeds of y. A string y covered by u thus generalises the idea of a repetition; that is, a string composed of exact concatenations of u. Even though a string is coverable somewhat more frequently than it is a repetition, still a string that can be covered by a single u is rare. As a result, seeking to find a more generally applicable and descriptive notion of cover, many articles were written on the computation of a minimum k-cover of y; that is, the minimum cardinality set of strings of length k that collectively cover y. Unfortunately, this computation turns out to be NP-hard. Therefore, in this article, we propose new, simple, easily-computed, and widely applicable notions of string covering that provide an intuitive and useful characterisation of a string: the enhanced cover; the enhanced left cover; and the enhanced left seed","Recently, Flouri et al. #AUTHOR_TAG suggested a related notion of enhanced covers which are additionally required to be borders of the word.","['Still it remains unlikely that an arbitrary word, even over the binary alphabet, has a cover (or even a seed).', 'For example, abaaababaabaaaababaa is a word that not only has no cover, but whose every prefix also has no cover.', 'In this article we provide a natural form of quasiperiodicity.', 'We introduce the notion of partial covers, that is, factors covering at least a given number of positions in w.', 'Recently, Flouri et al. #AUTHOR_TAG suggested a related notion of enhanced covers which are additionally required to be borders of the word.']",2,"['Still it remains unlikely that an arbitrary word, even over the binary alphabet, has a cover (or even a seed).', 'For example, abaaababaabaaaababaa is a word that not only has no cover, but whose every prefix also has no cover.', 'In this article we provide a natural form of quasiperiodicity.', 'We introduce the notion of partial covers, that is, factors covering at least a given number of positions in w.', 'Recently, Flouri et al. #AUTHOR_TAG suggested a related notion of enhanced covers which are additionally required to be borders of the word.']"

Thus, we solve an open problem stated in the survey by Smyth (2000) and improve upon a previous O(n log n) algorithm by Iliopoulos, Moore, and Park (1996).

This area is important both from theoretical and practical points of view. Repetitions are highly periodic factors (substrings) in strings and are related to periodicities, regularities, and compression. The repetitive structure of strings leads to higher compression rates, and conversely, some compression techniques are at the core of fast algorithms for detecting repetitions. There are several types of repetitions in strings: squares, cubes, and maximal repetitions also called runs. For these repetitions, we distinguish between the factors (sometimes qualified as distinct) and their occurrences (also called positioned factors). The combinatorics of repetitions is a very intricate area, full of open problems. For example we know that the number of (distinct) primitively-rooted squares in a string of length n is no more than [email protected](logn), conjecture to be n, and that their number of occurrences can be @Q(nlogn). Similarly we know that there are at most 1.029n and at least 0.944n maximal repetitions and the conjecture is again that the exact bound is n. We know almost everything about the repetitions in Sturmian words, but despite the simplicity of these words, the results are nontrivial. One of the main motivations for writing this text is the development during the last couple of years of new techniques and results about repetitions. We report both the progress which has been achieved and which we expect to happen.","The notion of periodicity in words and its many variants have been well-studied in numerous fields like combinatorics on words, pattern matching, data compression, automata theory, formal language theory, and molecular biology (see #AUTHOR_TAG).","['The notion of periodicity in words and its many variants have been well-studied in numerous fields like combinatorics on words, pattern matching, data compression, automata theory, formal language theory, and molecular biology (see #AUTHOR_TAG).', 'However the classic notion of periodicity is too restrictive to provide a description of a word such as abaababaaba, which is covered by copies of aba, yet not exactly periodic.', 'To fill this gap, the idea of quasiperiodicity was introduced [1].', 'In a periodic word, the occurrences of the period do not overlap.', 'In contrast, the occurrences of a quasiperiod in a quasiperiodic word may overlap.', 'Quasiperiodicity thus enables the detection of repetitive structures that would be ignored by the classic characterization of periods.']",4,"['The notion of periodicity in words and its many variants have been well-studied in numerous fields like combinatorics on words, pattern matching, data compression, automata theory, formal language theory, and molecular biology (see #AUTHOR_TAG).']"

It is now well established that quantities such as energy dissipation, scalar dissipation and enstrophy possess huge fluctuations in turbulent flows, and that the fluctuations become increasingly stronger with increasing Reynolds number of the flow. The effects of this small-scale ""intermittency"" on various aspects of reacting flows have not been addressed fully. This paper draws brief attention to a few possible effects on reaction rates, flame extinction, flamelet approximation, conditional moment closure methods, and so forth, besides commenting on possible effects on the resolution requirements of direct numerical simulations of turbulence. We also discuss the likelihood that large-amplitude events in a given class of shear flows are characteristic of that class, and that, plausible estimates of such quantities cannot be made, in general, on the hypothesis that large and small scales are independent. Finally, we briefly describe some ideas from multifractals as a potentially useful tool for an economical handling of a few of the problems touched upon here.

In an atmospheric context, it is analogous to single-column modeling (SCM) in that it lives on a 1D spatial domain, but different in that it time advances individual flow realizations rather than ensemble-averaged quantities.

This formulation is used to investigate variable-density effects in planar mixing layers. Computed results are compared to direct numerical simulations of temporally developing mixing layers and to measurements performed in spatially developing mixing layers. Dependencies of mean flow structure and fluctuation statistics on the free-stream density ratio __ are examined, including __ values beyond the range of previous experimental and computational studies. For temporally developing mixing layers, the previously noted decrease of the layer growth rate as __ deviates from unity is reproduced. For spatially developing mixing layers, dependence on __ is sensitive to whether the high-speed or the low-speed stream is denser; by convention, the latter case corresponds to __>1. Experimental results indicating that layer growth is an increasing function of __ have previously been interpreted on the basis of models that imply the continuation of this monotonic trend for all __. ODT reproduces the observed trend within the experimentally accessible range, but predicts a reversal of the trend slightly beyond that range and a subsequent decrease of the growth rate as __ increases.

Dekker""]","The dynamics of fully developed hydrodynamic turbulence still is a basically unsolved theoretical problem, due to the strong-coupling long-range nonlinearities in the Navier-Stokes equations. The present analysis focuses on the small-scale fluctuations in a turbulent boundary layer with one external length scale y(o). After taking a (2+1)D spatiotemporal spectral transform of the fluctuating vorticity fields, care is taken of large-scale sweeping which arises as a collective zero mode from the nonlinear flow terms. The ""unswept"" small-scale nonlinearities are then shown to be asymptotically locally isotropic (i.e., for wave numbers k-[?]) by internal consistency, which allows to close the nonlinear hierarchy. The Navier-Stokes equations (without external forcing) are integrated to give the spectral response of the fluctuating small-scale velocity fields on the presence of a locally isotropic blob of turbulence while it is being swept around over an arbitrary steady state mean velocity profile, using viscous boundary conditions at y=0. Averaging the response spectrum over all possible orientational configurations and sweep velocities results in a novel self-consistency integral for the 4D energy spectrum function. The distribution of turbulence sweep velocities is modeled by means of Levy-type densities, having an algebraic tail with power p>1. The generic case (which includes Von Karman's logarithmic mean velocity profile) is found to correspond to 1<p<3. Asymptotic analysis of the self-consistency integral leads to a differential equation which fixes the scaling exponent l of the unswept frequency D and admits a nonempty, integrable and positive definite Airy-type frequency spectrum E(i)(k,D/k(l))~k(m) with so-called ""normal"" Kolmogorov scaling, that is, m=-7/3 and l=2/3.

Pomin"", ""Ana Paula Valente"", ""Mariana S. Pereira"", ""Paulo A.S. Mour\u00e3o""]","Sulfated fucans from marine invertebrates have simple, linear structures, composed of repeating units of oligosaccharides. Most of these polysaccharides contain 3-linked fucosyl units, but each species of invertebrate has a specific pattern of sulfation. No specific enzyme able to cleave or to desulfate these polysaccharides has been described yet. Therefore, we employed an alternative approach, based on mild acid hydrolysis, in an attempt to obtain low molecular-weight derivatives from sulfated fucans. Surprisingly, we observed that sulfated fucans from Lytechinus variegatus and Strongylocentrotus pallidus (but not the sulfated fucans from other species) yield by mild acid hydrolysis oligosaccharides with well-defined molecular size as shown by narrow bands in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The sulfated oligosaccharides obtained by mild acid hydrolysis were purified by gel-filtration chromatography, and their structures were identified by (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, revealing an identical chemical composition for all oligosaccharides. When we followed the acid hydrolysis by (1)H-NMR spectroscopy, we found that a selective 2-desulfation occurs in the fucans from S. pallidus and from L. variegatus. The reaction has two stages. Initially, 2-sulfate esters at specific sites are removed. Then the desulfated units are cleaved, yielding oligosaccharides with well-defined molecular size. The apparent requirement for the selective 2-desulfation is the occurrence of an exclusively 2-sulfated fucosyl unit linked to or preceded by a 4-sulfated residue. Thus, a homofucan from Strongylocentrotus franciscanus resists desulfation by mild acid hydrolysis, because it lacks the neighboring 4-sulfated unit. Overall, our results show a new approach for desulfating sulfated fucans at specific sites and obtaining tailored sulfated oligosaccharides.","In an attempt to obtain low molecular-weight derivatives from sulfated fuco-oligosaccharides, results based on mild acid hydrolysis were also reported (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005).","['The use of MS (Lang et al., 2014) and NMR techniques coupled to specific enzymes helped a lot in the structural analysis (Correc et al., 2011) and in the preparation of oligosaccharides.', 'In an attempt to obtain low molecular-weight derivatives from sulfated fuco-oligosaccharides, results based on mild acid hydrolysis were also reported (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005).', 'Authors were able to prepare oligosaccharides with well-defined molecular size as shown by narrow bands in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.']",0,"['In an attempt to obtain low molecular-weight derivatives from sulfated fuco-oligosaccharides, results based on mild acid hydrolysis were also reported (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005).']"

Changes in aggrecanase were monitored by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses of ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5, and aggrecan proteolytic fragments. To test the interactions between ADAMTS-4 and membrane type 4 MMP (MT4-MMP), protein lysates purified from stimulated chondrocytes were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation.Disruption of chondrocyte CD44-HA interactions with HA oligosaccharides induced the transcription of ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

In particular, it has been shown that cell wall and storage polysaccharides from green, brown and red seaweeds (marine macroalgae) corresponding to ulvans, alginates, fucans, laminarin and carrageenans can trigger defense responses in plants enhancing protection against pathogens. In addition, oligosaccharides obtained by depolymerization of seaweed polysaccharides also induce protection against viral, fungal and bacterial infections in plants. In particular, most seaweed polysaccharides and derived oligosaccharides trigger an initial oxidative burst at local level and the activation of salicylic (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and/or ethylene signaling pathways at systemic level. The activation of these signaling pathways leads to an increased expression of genes encoding: (i) Pathogenesis-Related (PR) proteins with antifungal and antibacterial activities; (ii) defense enzymes such as pheylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and lipoxygenase (LOX) which determine accumulation of phenylpropanoid compounds (PPCs) and oxylipins with antiviral, antifugal and antibacterial activities and iii) enzymes involved in synthesis of terpenes, terpenoids and/or alkaloids having antimicrobial activities.

Some properties and primary structures of proteinaceous toxins from the venoms of three species of lionfish, Pterois antennata, Pterois lunulata and Pterois volitans, have so far been clarified. Our recent survey established the presence of hyaluronidase, presumably a toxin-spreading factor, in the venoms of P. antennata and P. volitans. This prompted us to examine enzymatic properties and primary structures of lionfish hyaluronidases. The hyaluronidases of P. antennata and P. volitans were shown to be optimally active at pH 6.6, 37degC and 0.1 M NaCl and specifically active against hyaluronan. These enzymatic properties are almost the same as those of stonefish hyaluronidases. The primary structures (483 amino acid residues) of the lionfish hyaluronidases were elucidated by a cDNA cloning strategy using degenerate primers designed from the reported amino acid sequences of the stonefish hyaluronidases.

The Celluclast and Viscozyme extracts of E. cava evidenced good hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenging activities (73.25% and 72.92%, respectively) as compared to those of other enzymatic extracts. Therefore, the Celluclast enzymatic extract was selected for use in further experiments, and separated into four different molecular weight fractions (<1, 1Ð10, 10Ð30 and >30 kDa). Among these fractions, the >30 kDa fraction manifested the most profound H2O2 scavenging activity, with a measured IC50 of 13 _g/ml. The >30 kDa fraction also strongly enhanced cell viability against H2O2-induced oxidative damage, and evidenced relatively good lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity in a Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (V79-4) cell line. This fraction also effected a reduction in the proportion of cells undergoing H2O2-induced apoptosis, as was demonstrated by a decreased quantity of sub-G1 hypodiploid cells and decreased apoptotic body formation on the flow cytometry assay.

Correa"", ""Georg Pohnert"", ""Constanze Pehlke"", ""Bernard Kloareg"", ""Philippe Potin""]","Combined phylogenetic, physiological, and biochemical approaches revealed that differences in defense-related responses among 17 species belonging to the Gracilariaceae were consistent with their evolutionary history. An oxidative burst response resulting from activation of NADPH oxidase was always observed in two of the subgenera of Gracilaria sensu lato (Gracilaria, Hydropuntia), but not in Gracilariopsis and in species related to Gracilaria chilensis (ÒchilensisÓ clade). On the other hand, all species examined except Gracilaria tenuistipitata var. liui and Gracilariopsis longissima responded with up-regulation of agar oligosaccharide oxidase to an challenge with agar oligosaccharides. As indicated by pharmacological experiments conducted with Gracilaria chilensis and Gracilaria sp. Òdura,Ó the up-regulation of agar oligosaccharide oxidase involved an NAD(P)H-dependent signaling pathway, but not kinase activity. By contrast, the activation of NADPH oxidase requires protein phosphorylation. Both responses are therefore independent, and the agar oligosaccharide-activated oxidative burst evolved after the capacity to oxidize agar oligosaccharide, probably providing additional defensive capacity to the most recently differentiated clades of Gracilariaceae. As demonstrated with Gracilaria gracilis, Gracilaria dura, and Gracilariopsis longissima, the different responses to agar oligosaccharides allow for a fast and nondestructive distinction among different clades of gracilarioids that are morphologically convergent. Based upon sequences of the chloroplast-encoded rbcL gene, this study suggests that at least some of the samples from NW America recorded as Gs. lemanaeiformis are probably Gs. chorda. Moreover, previous records of Gracilaria conferta from Israel are shown to be based upon misidentification of Gracilaria sp.

Therefore, the great potentials of sPS from marine microalgae to be used as nutraceuticals, therapeutic agents, cosmetics, or in other areas, such as engineering, are approached in this review","Scientific knowledge present in literature for each of these sources seems to differ, from the well-known seaweed (Rinaudo, 2007) to relatively new sources of polysaccharides such as extremophiles and microalgae (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013).","['A general view on the sources of marine polysaccharides is important.', 'Marine organisms representing good sources of polysaccharides are numerous and include seaweed, microalgae, bacteria, animals (fish, shellfish, mollusks, etc.).', 'Scientific knowledge present in literature for each of these sources seems to differ, from the well-known seaweed (Rinaudo, 2007) to relatively new sources of polysaccharides such as extremophiles and microalgae (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013).', 'The high biodiversity of the latter and how they can serve the biotechnological field has been recently pointed out (Stengel et al., 2011;Barra et al., 2014).', 'Cultivable or uncultivable marine microorganisms with particular emphasis on extremophiles are worth the mention.', 'Structural characteristics, rheological properties and absence of pathogenicity of exopolysaccharides from extremophiles make these compounds considerable for food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries (Nicolaus et al., 2010;Satpute et al., 2010;Finore et al., 2014).', 'The under-exploited chemical diversity present in marine polysaccharides from new sources obviously is of great interest for the development of new marine oligosaccharides.']",4,"['Scientific knowledge present in literature for each of these sources seems to differ, from the well-known seaweed (Rinaudo, 2007) to relatively new sources of polysaccharides such as extremophiles and microalgae (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013).']"

Processes controlling chitin degradation are summarized in reviews published some 20 years ago, but the recent use of culture-independent molecular methods has led to a revised understanding of the ecology and biochemistry of this process and the organisms involved. This review summarizes different mechanisms and the principal steps involved in chitin degradation at a molecular level while also discussing the coupling of community composition to measured chitin hydrolysis activities and substrate uptake. Ecological consequences are then highlighted and discussed with a focus on the cross feeding associated with the different habitats that arise because of the need for extracellular hydrolysis of the chitin polymer prior to metabolic use. Principal environmental drivers of chitin degradation are identified which are likely to influence both community composition of chitin degrading bacteria and measured chitin hydrolysis activities.","The case of chitinases is illustrative (#AUTHOR_TAG and Bertilsson, 2013).","['Enzymes for the hydrolysis of polysaccharides of marine origin are in the spotlight being the natural tools for polysaccharide metabolism in the living ecosystems.', 'The case of chitinases is illustrative (#AUTHOR_TAG and Bertilsson, 2013).', 'Chitin as the major component of crustacean represents a nutrient source for the ecosystem and a revised understanding of the ecology and biochemistry of this process has been proposed.', 'The marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans, whose complete genome sequence has been reported is of great interest in the context of enzymatic hydrolysis of polysaccharides.', 'An unusually large number of biocatalysts degrading complex polysaccharides is reported (Weiner et al., 2008).', 'For the sake of space it is out of the scope of this article discussing in details each polysaccharidase class.', 'Examples of application are reported in literature (Giordano et al., 2006;Trincone, 2013) with only latest few in a not-exhaustive Table 1.', ""However, it's worth mention a novel activity such as the marine hyaluronidase."", 'This enzyme class is capable of hydrolysis of hyaluronic acid (HA), a biopolymer abundant in extracellular matrices.', 'The study of hydrolysis-transfer reactions fo this enzyme is of interest for the identification of new selectivities in biocatalytic steps for the manipulation of the pharmacologically important HA.', 'Bovine enzyme is the commercial representative of hyaluronidases but new examples are found in other environments.', 'Venoms of two classes of fish, freshwater stingray (members of the genus Potamotrygon) and stonefish (members of the genus Synanceia), contain hyaluronidases that are considered']",0,"['Enzymes for the hydrolysis of polysaccharides of marine origin are in the spotlight being the natural tools for polysaccharide metabolism in the living ecosystems.', 'The case of chitinases is illustrative (#AUTHOR_TAG and Bertilsson, 2013).', 'Chitin as the major component of crustacean represents a nutrient source for the ecosystem and a revised understanding of the ecology and biochemistry of this process has been proposed.']"

Cyster""]","Lymphoid tissue development is associated with local accumulation of CD4+ CD3- IL-7R alpha hi hematopoietic cells that deliver lymphotoxin (LT)alpha 1 beta 2 signals to resident stromal cells. Previous studies have established an important role for CXCL13 (BLC) in the development of Peyer's patches (PP) and some peripheral lymph nodes (LNs), but the chemokine requirements for several LN types, including mesenteric LNs, remain undefined. Using CXCL13-/- mice that additionally carry the paucity of LN T cell mutation (plt/plt), we discovered that CCR7 ligands function in peripheral LN development. We also tested for a genetic interaction during LN development between CXCL13 and a cytokine receptor required in PP development, IL-7R alpha. Mice deficient for both CXCL13 and IL-7R alpha displayed a striking absence of LNs, including mesenteric LNs. These data extend the role of CXCL13 to the development of all LNs and establish a previously unappreciated role for IL-7R alpha in this process. Both circulating and LN CD4+ CD3- IL-7R alpha hi cells are shown to express LT alpha 1 beta 2 in an IL-7R alpha-dependent manner. Furthermore, CXCL13 was found to be sufficient to mediate CD4+ CD3- IL-7R alpha hi cell recruitment in vivo to an ectopic site. These findings indicate that CXCL13 and CCR7 ligands promote accumulation of CD4+ CD3- IL-7R alpha hi cells, delivering IL-7R alpha-dependent LT alpha 1 beta 2 signals critical for LN development.","While the generally accepted model of lymphoid tissue development suggests that haematopoietic cell aggregation is driven by the expression of three chemokines binding to two receptors on haematopoietic cells, other published research suggests that only one chemokine causes a significant difference in the formation of cell aggregation [#AUTHOR_TAG,39].","['Concerns over the modelling of a biological system that is incomplete is one criticism often levelled at simulation.', 'In scenarios where this is the case, or the biological knowledge is sufficient yet modelling the full detail is not computationally feasible, abstractions need to be made.', 'The impact these abstractions have on simulation response needs to be analysed and understood, in order that researchers can translate simulation results into meaningful biological hypotheses.', 'Figure 4 shows the argument supporting claim 1.1.2 of figure 2, that the abstractions made in our model of lymphoid tissue development are appropriate.', 'The abstractions in this specific case had to be made due to an incomplete understanding of chemokine expression and adhesion factor expression.', 'While the generally accepted model of lymphoid tissue development suggests that haematopoietic cell aggregation is driven by the expression of three chemokines binding to two receptors on haematopoietic cells, other published research suggests that only one chemokine causes a significant difference in the formation of cell aggregation [#AUTHOR_TAG,39].', 'As such, we have made the abstraction that a pathway consisting of one chemokine and one receptor is sufficient to capture this mechanism.', 'As detailed in the top left of figure 4, studies in the literature suggest that this may be a suitable abstraction to make, as the inhibition of receptor CXCR5 causes a significant difference in the formation of cell aggregation [38], yet there is no significant difference where the CCR7 receptor is inhibited [39].', 'Similar abstractions have been drawn for adhesion factor expression, with experimental results suggesting that as one adhesion pathway has a more significant impact on cell aggregation [40], others can be abstracted from the simulation.', 'A stringent analysis of each abstraction has provided us with a method to document these abstractions for full scientific scrutiny, allowed us to justify why these have been made with supporting evidence and to direct researchers assessing our simulation to that available evidence.']",0,"['While the generally accepted model of lymphoid tissue development suggests that haematopoietic cell aggregation is driven by the expression of three chemokines binding to two receptors on haematopoietic cells, other published research suggests that only one chemokine causes a significant difference in the formation of cell aggregation [#AUTHOR_TAG,39].']"

However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.","In ecology, the ODD (overview, design concepts, details) protocol is starting to address this, through application of a standard protocol completed while implementing a computational model, with the aim of ensuring reproducibility of results #AUTHOR_TAG.","['In general, simulations of complex systems, including biological systems, are difficult to describe: it is hard to explain and justify complex interactions, either in real biological systems or in simulations.', 'Toxicology and human risk assessment studies, for example, use adverse outcome pathway (AOP) tools to demonstrate existing understanding of how molecular, cellular, organ and organism interactions link a molecular initiating event with a particular adverse outcome, such as skin inflammation [17].', 'This information, derived from the literature or experimental studies, is analysed and presented as a flow diagram.', 'The strength of the evidence supporting each event, which may be established as well as hypothetical or predictive, is evaluated and accompanies the diagram.', 'Yet, AOPs have been criticized for providing a representation of the toxicological process that is simplistic [17], splitting the representation of the process and the evidence.', 'For the description of computational models, both unified modelling language, adopted in the development of computer software, and systems biology mark-up language (SBML) may be applied [18][19][20]; the latter possessing the benefit of allowing model execution by a number of SBML-supported software tools.', 'Both however are limited by restrictions in the extent of the system they can capture: UML lacks the formalism to capture some biological features (such as cyclicfeedback) [21], and SBML cannot currently describe complex agent-based models.', 'In addition, both are purely descriptive: neither provides complete, evidence-supported detail stating how that model has been composed.', 'In ecology, the ODD (overview, design concepts, details) protocol is starting to address this, through application of a standard protocol completed while implementing a computational model, with the aim of ensuring reproducibility of results #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'The ODD protocol addresses the purpose behind the creation of the model, details the inclusion of each biological component of interest (e.g.', 'cell type) and defines submodels that describe how observed biological behaviour and attributes are implemented.', 'Any specific assumptions underlying the implemented behaviour are also recorded.', 'The ODD authors note that completion of the protocol provides researchers with all the information they require to run the simulation and reproduce the published results: the level of information required for a typical methods section of a publication [22].', 'Yet, ODD also does not provide a motivation and justification for the detailed model and implementation.', 'Scientific repeatability is addressed, not fitness for purpose.', 'The ODD authors also state that, within the protocol, there should be no recording of information concerning experimental scenarios, simulation experiments and results from statistical techniques such as sensitivity analyses: these should be recorded and published separately [22].', 'However, we contend that having such information within the simulation design is a key part of an argument of fitness for purpose that convinces researchers the simulation is appropriate for the studies in which it will be applied.']",1,"['In general, simulations of complex systems, including biological systems, are difficult to describe: it is hard to explain and justify complex interactions, either in real biological systems or in simulations.', 'In ecology, the ODD (overview, design concepts, details) protocol is starting to address this, through application of a standard protocol completed while implementing a computational model, with the aim of ensuring reproducibility of results #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'The ODD protocol addresses the purpose behind the creation of the model, details the inclusion of each biological component of interest (e.g.', 'cell type) and defines submodels that describe how observed biological behaviour and attributes are implemented.', 'Any specific assumptions underlying the implemented behaviour are also recorded.', 'The ODD authors note that completion of the protocol provides researchers with all the information they require to run the simulation and reproduce the published results: the level of information required for a typical methods section of a publication [22].', 'Yet, ODD also does not provide a motivation and justification for the detailed model and implementation.']"

Lymphoid organogenesis during embryonic life is dependent on molecules the temporal expression of which is tightly regulated. During this process, haematopoietic 'inducer' cells interact with stromal 'organizer' cells, giving rise to the lymphoid organ primordia. Here we show that the haematopoietic cells in the gut exhibit a random pattern of motility before aggregation into the primordia of Peyer's patches, a major component of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. We further show that a CD45+CD4-CD3-Il7Ralpha-c-Kit+CD11c+ haematopoietic population expressing lymphotoxin has an important role in the formation of Peyer's patches. A subset of these cells expresses the receptor tyrosine kinase RET, which is essential for mammalian enteric nervous system formation. We demonstrate that RET signalling is also crucial for Peyer's patch formation. Functional genetic analysis revealed that Gfra3-deficiency results in impairment of Peyer's patch development, suggesting that the signalling axis RET/GFRalpha3/ARTN is involved in this process. To support this hypothesis, we show that the RET ligand ARTN is a strong attractant of gut haematopoietic cells, inducing the formation of ectopic Peyer's patch-like structures. Our work strongly suggests that the RET signalling pathway, by regulating the development of both the nervous and lymphoid system in the gut, has a key role in the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate intestine organogenesis.","Although a basic model of tissue formation has been developed through laboratory experimentation [31,#AUTHOR_TAG[35][36], the reasons for this emergent behaviour are not fully understood.","['Through the adoption of an agent-based modelling approach, we have developed a computational model, or simulation, of lymphoid tissue development in pre-natal mice [14,15].', 'Populations of haematopoietic cells migrate into the developing gut from rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J.

Success requires the relationship between simulation and the real-world system to be established: substantial aspects of the biological system are typically unknown, and the abstract nature of simulation can complicate interpretation of in silico results in terms of the biology. Here we present spartan (Simulation Parameter Analysis R Toolkit ApplicatioN), a package of statistical techniques specifically designed to help researchers understand this relationship and provide novel biological insight. The tools comprising spartan help identify which simulation results can be attributed to the dynamics of the modelled biological system, rather than artefacts of biological uncertainty or parametrisation, or simulation stochasticity. Statistical analyses reveal the influence that pathways and components have on simulation behaviour, offering valuable biological insight into aspects of the system under study. We demonstrate the power of spartan in providing critical insight into aspects of lymphoid tissue development in the small intestine through simulation. Spartan is released under a GPLv2 license, implemented within the open source R statistical environment, and freely available from both the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/spartan. The techniques within the package can be applied to traditional ordinary or partial differential equation simulations as well as agent-based implementations. Manuals, comprehensive tutorials, and example simulation data upon which spartan can be applied are available from the website.","We have previously developed a computational model, or simulation, of

However, many existing safety cases, in their attempt to manage potentially complex arguments, are poorly structured, presented and understood. This creates problems in developing and maintaining safety cases, and in capturing successful safety arguments for use on future projects.  This thesis defines and demonstrates a coherent approach to the development, presentation, maintenance and reuse of the safety arguments within a safety case. This approach is based upon a graphical technique -- the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) -- and has three strands. Firstly, a method for the use of GSN is defined together with an approach to supporting incremental safety case development. Secondly, the thesis presents a systematic process for the maintenance of a GSN-structured safety argument. Thirdly, the concept of `Safety Case Patterns&apos; is defined as a means of supporting and promoting the reuse of successful safety arguments between safety cases. Examples of the approach are provided throughout.  Evaluation of the approach is described through tool implementation, case studies, pilot projects and industrial project applications. Through these activities the approach has been shown to be both a valid and capable tool for safety case management","Drawing on safety-case argumentation, we create a diagrammatic summary of the structured argument of fitness for purpose, using a visual notation closely based on the standard safety-critical argumentation notation, goal structuring notation (GSN) [#AUTHOR_TAG,29].","['Drawing on safety-case argumentation, we create a diagrammatic summary of the structured argument of fitness for purpose, using a visual notation closely based on the standard safety-critical argumentation notation, goal structuring notation (GSN) [#AUTHOR_TAG,29].', 'The argument is presented as a tree of connected argument components, starting from a toplevel claim (a GSN goal).', 'The researcher identifies a set of fitness-for-purpose requirements (referred to as goals or claims, that the argument seeks to substantiate), and a set of strategies that can be used to assess whether the requirement has been met.', 'The strategies typically break goals down into subgoals, and eventually link to evidence supporting the claim, alongside the source of the evidence, where appropriate.', 'In the simulation context, the GSN argument structure summarizes the biological information upon which the model has been constructed, opening this to critique.', 'GSN also allows goals to be linked to assumptions and justifications.', 'If a requirement cannot be fully supported by available evidence, for example where there are gaps in the biological understanding, then the assumptions and abstractions made in place of this evidence are documented, opening all implementation decisions to scrutiny by other researchers in the field and identifying areas of biological study that have been overlooked or require further laboratory work.', 'In addition, and in contrast to the ODD protocol described above, argumentation approaches can be applied not only to simulation development, but also to design and sensitivity analyses and simulation experiments.']",5,"['Drawing on safety-case argumentation, we create a diagrammatic summary of the structured argument of fitness for purpose, using a visual notation closely based on the standard safety-critical argumentation notation, goal structuring notation (GSN) [#AUTHOR_TAG,29].']"

The primary manifestation of this property has been the difficulty in translating the information derived from reductionist, basic science research into effective clinical treatment regimens for sepsis. However, the recognition of the ""complexity"" of the AIR is not without its pitfalls. Despite its limitations, reductionism remains the primary means of obtaining scientific information. Furthermore, a functional shortcoming of use of the term complex has been to make it equivalent to ""essentially unsolvable."" Therefore, a mechanism is needed to integrate the apparatus of reductionist analysis into a complex synthetic methodology that overcomes the current limitations of both. Toward this end, I propose a structure for a class of collaborative, community-wide in silico models that use the framework of agent-based modeling. Agent-based modeling is a type of mathematical modeling that focuses on the behaviors of the components of complex systems and is well suited for translating the results of basic science experiments. I will also introduce a preliminary version of a syntactical ""grammar"" that can potentially be used to facilitate the transfer of basic science data into computer code. It is hoped that when a mature version of this framework is implemented, the resulting models will provide a functional, synthetic data base on the AIR that could be used for directing research, testing hypotheses, teaching and training, and drug discovery/testing.","While it may seem unnecessary to use techniques from aircraft safety in biological simulation, we note that errors or misinterpretation of simulation results may have significant, possibly even safetycritical repercussions if, for instance, a simulation is used as a key decision-making tool in clinical trials [#AUTHOR_TAG,27].","['Here, we present the use of a structured argumentation approach that assists the researcher in recording justifications rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J.

As such, it provides particularly interesting challenges for a combined computational and experimental analysis. We developed a novel detailed molecular signaling model that, when used to simulate the response to the attractant cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), made nontrivial predictions about Dictyostelium chemosensing. These predictions, including the unexpected existence of spatially asymmetrical, multiphasic, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-induced PTEN translocation and phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)P3 generation, were experimentally verified by quantitative single-cell microscopy leading us to propose significant modifications to the current standard model for chemoattractant-induced biochemical polarization in this organism. Key to this successful modeling effort was the use of ""Simmune,"" a new software package that supports the facile development and testing of detailed computational representations of cellular behavior. An intuitive interface allows user definition of complex signaling networks based on the definition of specific molecular binding site interactions and the subcellular localization of molecules. It automatically translates such inputs into spatially resolved simulations and dynamic graphical representations of the resulting signaling network that can be explored in a manner that closely parallels wet lab experimental procedures.

Andrews"", ""Jon Timmis"", ""Vipin Kumar""]","We present a framework to assist the diagrammatic modelling of complex biological systems using the unified modelling language (UML). The framework comprises three levels of modelling, ranging in scope from the dynamics of individual model entities to system-level emergent properties. By way of an immunological case study of the mouse disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, we show how the framework can be used to produce models that capture and communicate the biological system, detailing how biological entities, interactions and behaviours lead to higher-level emergent properties observed in the real world. We demonstrate how the UML can be successfully applied within our framework, and provide a critique of UML's ability to capture concepts fundamental to immunology and biology more generally. We show how specialized, well-explained diagrams with less formal semantics can be used where no suitable UML formalism exists. We highlight UML's lack of expressive ability concerning cyclic feedbacks in cellular networks, and the compounding concurrency arising from huge numbers of stochastic, interacting agents. To compensate for this, we propose several additional relationships for expressing these concepts in UML's activity diagram. We also demonstrate the ambiguous nature of class diagrams when applied to complex biology, and question their utility in modelling such dynamic systems. Models created through our framework are non-executable, and expressly free of simulation implementation concerns. They are a valuable complement and precursor to simulation specifications and implementations, focusing purely on thoroughly exploring the biology, recording hypotheses and assumptions, and serve as a communication medium detailing exactly how a simulation relates to the real biology.","Both however are limited by restrictions in the extent of the system they can capture: UML lacks the formalism to capture some biological features (such as cyclicfeedback) #AUTHOR_TAG, and SBML cannot currently describe complex agent-based models.","['In general, simulations of complex systems, including biological systems, are difficult to describe: it is hard to explain and justify complex interactions, either in real biological systems or in simulations.', 'Toxicology and human risk assessment studies, for example, use adverse outcome pathway (AOP) tools to demonstrate existing understanding of how molecular, cellular, organ and organism interactions link a molecular initiating event with a particular adverse outcome, such as skin inflammation [17].', 'This information, derived from the literature or experimental studies, is analysed and presented as a flow diagram.', 'The strength of the evidence supporting each event, which may be established as well as hypothetical or predictive, is evaluated and accompanies the diagram.', 'Yet, AOPs have been criticized for providing a representation of the toxicological process that is simplistic [17], splitting the representation of the process and the evidence.', 'For the description of computational models, both unified modelling language, adopted in the development of computer software, and systems biology mark-up language (SBML) may be applied [18][19][20]; the latter possessing the benefit of allowing model execution by a number of SBML-supported software tools.', 'Both however are limited by restrictions in the extent of the system they can capture: UML lacks the formalism to capture some biological features (such as cyclicfeedback) #AUTHOR_TAG, and SBML cannot currently describe complex agent-based models.', 'In addition, both are purely descriptive: neither provides complete, evidence-supported detail stating how that model has been composed.', 'In ecology, the ODD (overview, design concepts, details) protocol is starting to address this, through application of a standard protocol completed while implementing a computational model, with the aim of ensuring reproducibility of results [22].', 'The ODD protocol addresses the purpose behind the creation of the model, details the inclusion of each biological component of interest (e.g.', 'cell type) and defines submodels that describe how observed biological behaviour and attributes are implemented.', 'Any specific assumptions underlying the implemented behaviour are also recorded.', 'The ODD authors note that completion of the protocol provides researchers with all the information they require to run the simulation and reproduce the published results: the level of information required for a typical methods section of a publication [22].', 'Yet, ODD also does not provide a motivation and justification for the detailed model and implementation.', 'Scientific repeatability is addressed, not fitness for purpose.', 'The ODD authors also state that, within the protocol, there should be no recording of information concerning experimental scenarios, simulation experiments and results from statistical techniques such as sensitivity analyses: these should be recorded and published separately [22].', 'However, we contend that having such information within the simulation design is a key part of an argument of fitness for purpose that convinces researchers the simulation is appropriate for the studies in which it will be applied.']",1,"['In general, simulations of complex systems, including biological systems, are difficult to describe: it is hard to explain and justify complex interactions, either in real biological systems or in simulations.', 'Both however are limited by restrictions in the extent of the system they can capture: UML lacks the formalism to capture some biological features (such as cyclicfeedback) #AUTHOR_TAG, and SBML cannot currently describe complex agent-based models.']"

However, the quality of simulated results are highly dependent on the choice of modeling strategy. We examine two modeling approaches of HIV pathogenesis: Mathematical and Multi-Agent (or MA) Models. The latter has relatively wider Model Scope due to the agent-rule specification method. Mathematical Models employ Parameter and Population/Subpopulation Level entity granularities with equation-based interaction, while MA Models specify entities at Individual Level, implemented with agents to describe interactions via IF-THEN rules. Compared to the former, MA Models naturally handles entity heterogeneity and spatial non-uniformity, and suffers less from the issue of directly designed dynamics. Both approaches are however, not directly accessible to immunologists due to the need for programming knowledge; hence, closer collaboration between computer scientists and immunologists is necessary.","Computational models have the capacity to provide an interpretation of biological data and act as a scientific tool through which new hypotheses can be established and explored [#AUTHOR_TAG,3].","['The application of computational and mathematical models is a generally accepted technique in physical sciences and engineering, yet was met with scepticism by experimental biologists [1].', 'With advances in computational power, the development of new modelling techniques and methodologies, and the promotion of interdisciplinary research, traditional biological studies complemented by the use of in silico predictive tools is now becoming more prevalent.', 'Computational models have the capacity to provide an interpretation of biological data and act as a scientific tool through which new hypotheses can be established and explored [#AUTHOR_TAG,3].', 'Furthermore, computational tools allow virtual experimentation not bound by the ethical and financial constraints associated with laboratory studies.']",0,"['The application of computational and mathematical models is a generally accepted technique in physical sciences and engineering, yet was met with scepticism by experimental biologists [1].', 'With advances in computational power, the development of new modelling techniques and methodologies, and the promotion of interdisciplinary research, traditional biological studies complemented by the use of in silico predictive tools is now becoming more prevalent.', 'Computational models have the capacity to provide an interpretation of biological data and act as a scientific tool through which new hypotheses can be established and explored [#AUTHOR_TAG,3].']"

CC2561,37342138,Biofuels and biodiversity in South Africa,Ryan Blanchard,Forestry Trees as Invasive Aliens,"[""David M. Richardson""]","Some alien tree species used in commercial forestry and agroforestry cause major problems as invaders of natural and seminatural ecosystems. The magnitude of the problem has increased significantly over the past few decades, with a rapid increase in afforestation and changes in land use. Trends can be explained by analyzing natural experiments created by the widespread planting of a small number of species in different parts of the world. The species that cause the greatest problems are generally those that have been planted most widely and for the longest time. The most affected areas have the longest histories of intensive planting. Pinus spp. are especially problematic, and at least 19 species are invasive over large areas in the southern hemisphere, where some species cause major problems. The most invasive Pinus species have a predictable set of life-history attributes, including low seed mass, short juvenile period, and short interval between large seed crops. Pine invasions have severely impacted large areas of grassland and scrub-brushland in the southern hemisphere by causing shifts in life-form dominance, reduced structural diversity, increased biomass, disruption of prevailing vegetation dynamics, and changing nutrient cycling patterns. The (unavoidable) negative impacts of forestry with alien species are thus spilling over into areas set aside for conservation or water production. There is an urgent need to integrate the various means available for reducing the negative impacts of current invaders and to implement protocols to regulate the translocation of species that are known to be invasive.","wattles, pines and eucalypts) have become important invasive species in adjacent landscapes.#AUTHOR_TAG","['Non-native plant species are widely used for commercial forestry, agro-forestry, agriculture and horticulture in South Africa 17 and economically important, wide-scale plantings have had considerable impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. 17,52', 'Escapes from plantations (e.g.', 'wattles, pines and eucalypts) have become important invasive species in adjacent landscapes.#AUTHOR_TAG', 'Many of the problems we face today caused by invasive trees are the result of plantings incentivised by government schemes focusing on shortterm economic or social incentives. 53', 'It is estimated that 10 million ha of South Africa has been invaded to some degree and if condensed to adjust the cover to 100%, then this amounts to 1.7 million ha, which is greater than the extent of commercial forestry which totalled 1.5 million in 1996/1997. 54', 'spite the contribution of alien trees and shrubs to economies and livelihoods, there are many unexpected consequences and subsequent costs, both environmental and economic, which often outweigh the benefits of introduction. 36,51', 'evertheless the potential economic gains may be too great to prevent the widespread introduction of alien species for biofuel purposes. 5', 'The reasons for choosing alien plants over indigenous species for commercial forestry have been discussed previously. 51', 'The criteria for biofuel feedstock selection are similar, that is species: 1) need to grow fast with minimum tending, 2) are easy to manage, 3) produce large quantities of seeds/biomass and 4) are marketable and profitable. 55', 'ny of the dedicated energy crops will be non-native to the region of planting and will probably be introduced multiple times as new varieties are developed for improved yield or resistance to pests and diseases (with propagules probably originating from different regions), further compounding the risk of future invasion. 56', 'Feedstocks that are known to be invasive and which are guaranteed to cause problems in this regard if used for biofuel production in South Africa include perennial grasses (e.g.', 'Arundo donax, Miscanthus spp.', 'and Sorghum halepense) and trees (e.g.', 'Millettia pinnata and species of Acacia, Eucalyptus and Populus).', 'There is a serious risk of private investors looking to profit from overseas demand for biomass, which could see these and many new plant species being widely propagated before effective legislation and planning guidelines are in place.']",4,"['Non-native plant species are widely used for commercial forestry, agro-forestry, agriculture and horticulture in South Africa 17 and economically important, wide-scale plantings have had considerable impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. 17,52', 'wattles, pines and eucalypts) have become important invasive species in adjacent landscapes.#AUTHOR_TAG']"

Both domestic and global population growth partly underlie the increased demand for crop products over the past century. Increased production was initially achieved mainly by expanding the area under cultivation, and, from the 1960s onwards, principally through enhanced yields per hectare.

The crops grown and the yields per hectare differed significantly between the predominantly commercial, former white-owned areas and the mainly subsistence, former homeland areas.

StakeRare identifies stakeholders and asks them to recommend other stakeholders and stakeholder roles, builds a social network with stakeholders as nodes and their recommendations as links, and prioritizes stakeholders using a variety of social network measures to determine their project influence.

StakeRare was evaluated by applying it to a software project for a 30,000-user system, and a substantial empirical study of requirements elicitation was conducted.

A problem is split into small chunks, that are then solved by a crowd of users on the Internet. In this paper we investigate whether it is possible to exploit CrowdSourcing to solve the oracle problem: We produce tasks asking users to evaluate CrowdOracles - assertions that reflect the current behavior of the program. If the crowd determines that an assertion does not match the behavior described in the code documentation, then a bug has been found.

There are many reasons why homeowners buy the homes that they do; location, quality, price, amenities, and other factors play into those decisions. In the past, energy efficiency is believed only to have played a small role in particular home-purchase decisions. This report summarizes results of a ""natural experiment"" that describes views of homeowners who live in a 193-home residential tract outside of Sacramento, California. Homes in this tract are comparable in most respects except that they have substantially different levels of energy efficiency. In a series of four focus group discussions, views of these homeowners regarding their purchase decisions were collected and analyzed. Results suggest areas of further research, including mixed-method approaches to better understand the role of energy efficiency in homebuyer decisionmaking; investigating strategies for marketing energy efficiency; and investigating homeowner energy awareness that may be related to neighborhood design.","A kind of comparative feedback could in fact come from discussion between building users themselves for example, #AUTHOR_TAG & Bernstein (2006) noted, in a study of two housing developments in California, one a zero-emission home (ZEH) development and one more conventional, that awareness of the value of energy eciency in non-ZEH home owners appeared to have grown over the past year of home ownership, having been associated with paying energy bills and communications with ZEH home owner neighbours whose bills are substantially lower.","[""The social aspects of energy consumption lend themselves to incorporating social proof comparisons as part of feedbackeither in reference to a social norm (what is`normal' consumption) or comparisons to other building users' energy use, perhaps within a community."", 'A kind of comparative feedback could in fact come from discussion between building users themselves for example, #AUTHOR_TAG & Bernstein (2006) noted, in a study of two housing developments in California, one a zero-emission home (ZEH) development and one more conventional, that awareness of the value of energy eciency in non-ZEH home owners appeared to have grown over the past year of home ownership, having been associated with paying energy bills and communications with ZEH home owner neighbours whose bills are substantially lower.']",0,"[""The social aspects of energy consumption lend themselves to incorporating social proof comparisons as part of feedbackeither in reference to a social norm (what is`normal' consumption) or comparisons to other building users' energy use, perhaps within a community."", 'A kind of comparative feedback could in fact come from discussion between building users themselves for example, #AUTHOR_TAG & Bernstein (2006) noted, in a study of two housing developments in California, one a zero-emission home (ZEH) development and one more conventional, that awareness of the value of energy eciency in non-ZEH home owners appeared to have grown over the past year of home ownership, having been associated with paying energy bills and communications with ZEH home owner neighbours whose bills are substantially lower.']"

There is a wide variety of techniques and methods used, intended to work via different sets of cognitive and environmental principles. These approaches make different assumptions about 'what people are like': how users will respond to behavioural interventions, and why, and in the process reveal some of the assumptions that designers and other stakeholders, such as clients commissioning a project, make about human nature. This paper discusses three simple models of user behaviour - the pinball, the shortcut and the thoughtful - which emerge from user experience designers' statements about users while focused on designing for behaviour change. The models are characterised using systems terminology and the application of each model to design for sustainable behaviour is examined via a series of examples.","It is not dissimilar to the idea of designing an interface to match the user's existing understanding or mental model of the system (discussed in #AUTHOR_TAG, Harrison and Stanton, 2012).","[""This to some extent accords with one of Carnegie's recommendations described in the previous section, and is a familiar mantra in service design and user experience design."", ""It is not dissimilar to the idea of designing an interface to match the user's existing understanding or mental model of the system (discussed in #AUTHOR_TAG, Harrison and Stanton, 2012).""]",0,"[""This to some extent accords with one of Carnegie's recommendations described in the previous section, and is a familiar mantra in service design and user experience design."", ""It is not dissimilar to the idea of designing an interface to match the user's existing understanding or mental model of the system (discussed in #AUTHOR_TAG, Harrison and Stanton, 2012).""]"

In their comment on that review, E. L. Einspruch and B. D. Forman (see record 1986-08199-001) agreed with this conclusion but suggested that it was due to the presence of methodological errors in the research on NLP to date and that the efficacy of NLP was open to debate. In the present article, it is contended that those suggestions were based on misconceptions regarding the factors that limit the methodological worth of research. Several of the detailed criticisms from that review are refuted, and data from 7 recent studies that further demonstrate that research data do not support either the basic tenets of NLP or their application in counseling situations are presented.

Four diverse perspectives are reviewed here: conventional and behavioral economics, technology adoption theory and attitude-based decision making, social and environmental psychology, and sociology. The individual decision models in these traditions differ axiomatically. Some are founded on informed rationality or psychological variables, and others emphasize physical or contextual factors from individual to social scales. Each perspective suggests particular lessons for designing interventions to change behavior. Throughout the review, these lessons are applied to decisions affecting residential energy use. Examples are drawn from both intuitive and reasoning-based types of decision as well as from a range of decision contexts that include capital investments in weatherization and repetitive behaviors such as appliance use. Areas of difference and similarity between various theoretical approaches and their practical implications are highlighted. Conclusions are drawn on how to develop a more integrated approach to both behavioral research and intervention design in a residential energy context.","In terms of users learning new behaviours from each other, or deciding to adopt more ecient technology, #AUTHOR_TAG and Dowlatabadi (2007) suggest that this will be easier when such changes are very visible: Establishing social norms works most eectively for technologies or behaviours that are observable by potential adopters, favouring solar photovoltaics over insulation for example.","['In terms of users learning new behaviours from each other, or deciding to adopt more ecient technology, #AUTHOR_TAG and Dowlatabadi (2007) suggest that this will be easier when such changes are very visible: Establishing social norms works most eectively for technologies or behaviours that are observable by potential adopters, favouring solar photovoltaics over insulation for example.', 'Interventions at the community level are particularly relevant where social norms at the household level might actually be barriers to adoption as in some cases with photovoltaics.', ""Work has been done on giving householders normative feedback, explicitly comparing their energy use against that of`comparable households' or neighbours."", 'Darby (2006) notes that while householders are interested in comparisons, they do not necessarily make savings when shown them.', 'The choice of comparison groups is problematic (people may be unhappy with the validity of the group they are assigned to) and the response to comparisons may not be positive.']",0,"['In terms of users learning new behaviours from each other, or deciding to adopt more ecient technology, #AUTHOR_TAG and Dowlatabadi (2007) suggest that this will be easier when such changes are very visible: Establishing social norms works most eectively for technologies or behaviours that are observable by potential adopters, favouring solar photovoltaics over insulation for example.', 'Interventions at the community level are particularly relevant where social norms at the household level might actually be barriers to adoption as in some cases with photovoltaics.', ""Work has been done on giving householders normative feedback, explicitly comparing their energy use against that of`comparable households' or neighbours."", 'Darby (2006) notes that while householders are interested in comparisons, they do not necessarily make savings when shown them.']"

The article looks at different states, different cities, different neighbourhoods and different financial centres. Investors in many places had invested in residential mortgage backed securities and have seen their value drop. Housing bubbles, faltering economies and regulation together have shaped the geography of the financial crisis on the state and city level in the US. Subprime and predatory lending have affected low-income and minority communities more than others and we therefore not only see a concentration of foreclosures in certain cities, but also in certain neighbourhoods.

The author contends that central banks contribute to financial instability, addresses the problems that can arise when monetary policy is applied inconsistently, and explains the moral hazard problem inherent in central banksÕ acting as lenders of last resort. In The Origin of Financial Crises: Central Banks, Credit Bubbles and the Efficient Market Fallacy , George Cooper offers an explanation for the current credit crisis and for other speculative bubbles that preceded it. Building on the theories of Hyman Minsky and John Maynard Keynes, Cooper, a principal at Alignment Investors, argues that such bubbles are the result of an inherent instability of the financial system. When financial assets are financed by debt and marked to market, a drop in asset prices sets off a downward spiral. Lenders force the sale of assets that serve as collateral on loans that become undercollateralized owing to the initial drop in asset prices. Conversely, an increase in asset prices facilitates an increase in financial leverage because the higher collateral value can support a larger amount of debt. To offset these destabilizing factors, Cooper recommends intervention by a government agencyÑnamely, a central bank. According to Cooper, existing central banks are ineffective because they focus on price stability of consumer goods whereas they should be focusing on stability of asset prices. Cooper believes that focusing on consumer price inflation is unnecessary because goods markets are inherently stable (that is, higher prices cause a drop in demand and vice versa). The reason central banks do not target asset prices is that they erroneously believe the fallacy of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), according to whichÑby CooperÕs definitionÑassets are always correctly priced. He maintains that to achieve stability in asset prices, central banks should steer changes in the aggregate amount of credit creation. And every once in a while, for good measure, they should engage in a sudden withdrawal of liquidity as a sort of systemic fire drill that keeps market participants on their toes. CooperÕs contention that central banks contribute to financial instability is not new, at least not to central banks. In a speech in September 2005, well before the current credit crisis began, Alan Greenspan, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board chairman at the time, acknowledged that if a central bank is successful in reducing fluctuations in the business cycle, it decreases systemic risk; but in so doing, it may inadvertently trigger risk complacency on the part of market participants. In a November 2008 speech, the FedÕs vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, made the same argument. Still, Cooper does make some worthwhile points. His charge that monetary policy is inconsistent if it means laissez faire during an economic expansion and interventionism during a contraction has some validity. Cooper is also correct that KeynesÕ prescriptions were intended to move an economy out of a depression but are nowadays used more to avoid recessions than to exit depressions. Cooper also argues correctly that the achievement of so-called soft landings prevents borrowers from learning firsthand that their excessive borrowing is indeed excessive. And CooperÕs belief that Òit is better to have a volatile and growing economy than a stable and stagnant oneÓ is likely to find acceptance by many readers. Finally, Cooper does a commendable job in explaining the moral hazard problem inherent in central banksÕ acting as lenders of last resort. Nevertheless, CooperÕs criticism of the efficient market hypothesis and of its application to central banking misses the mark. In his view, the basic tenet of the EMH is that asset prices are always ÒcorrectÓ and that equilibrium is, therefore, the result. He is correct in contending that neoclassical economics probably focuses too much on equilibrium conditions and not enough on the process by which we move from one state to the nextÑin effect, never quite reaching equilibrium. But the EMH does not really imply equilibrium. It merely states that available information is reflected in asset prices. As new information arrives, prices change. Because new information arrives irregularly, prices change irregularly. Thus, there is no equilibrium. Likewise, the EMH makes no claims as to whether a price is ÒcorrectÓ (whatever a correct price might be). Similarly, aiming for stability in prices of goodsÑas most central banks do most of the timeÑis not quite the same thing as expressing a judgment about the ÒcorrectnessÓ of the existing price level (again, whatever that might be). The reason that central banks pursue price stability is that a fiat currency requires an inflation anchor. Cooper ignores such watershed episodes as the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic in the 1920s, the Great Inflation in the United States in the 1970s, andÑto cite a contemporary exampleÑthe inflation and socioeconomic unrest in Zimbabwe today. (In general, the book is featherlight when it comes to empirical evidence.) Central bankers express two main reasons for not targeting asset prices: (1) It is virtually impossible to distinguish a bubble from a more justified increase in asset prices, and (2) a change in the monetary policy that would be required to deflate an incipient bubble might well trigger an economic recession. Cooper dispenses with these ideas in a single footnote. As an argument for the drastic change in monetary policy that he proposes or as an explanation for the current credit crisis, his thesis is woefully inadequate.","The financial crisis that gripped the global financial system in the latter half of 2007 has prompted had significant and far-reaching re-evaluation of orthodox market theories and their associated neoliberal policy prescriptions (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2008;Kay, 2009;Norfield, 2010), and this has persisted -if not deepened -with the sovereign debt crisis in the EU since 2010 (Lane, 2010;Mody and Sandri,2012).","[""In the last couple of years, the concept of the 'market' has once again come to the fore in both policy and social scientific debates."", 'The financial crisis that gripped the global financial system in the latter half of 2007 has prompted had significant and far-reaching re-evaluation of orthodox market theories and their associated neoliberal policy prescriptions (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2008;Kay, 2009;Norfield, 2010), and this has persisted -if not deepened -with the sovereign debt crisis in the EU since 2010 (Lane, 2010;Mody and Sandri,2012).', 'In both social scientific and policy discussion, the unprecedented scale of the crisis has even led to a significant questioning of the value of hegemonic economic theories concerning market behaviours and the capacity of economic models to accurately replicate or predict the nature of markets (FT, 2008;Allington et al., 2011).', ""Both policy commentators and social scientists have widely argued that significant aspects of the financial crisis can be attributed to various forms of 'market failure' (Washington Post, 2008;Aysen Doyran, 2011;Akinbami, 2011;Greenspan, 2008)."", ""Consequently, a key element of mainstream policy re-sponses to the financial crisis and the subsequent global recession have been framed in terms of a discussion about how to rectify markets 'not working properly' or preventing actors undertaking malpractices that produce 'market failure' (Krugman, 2008;Bagella and Ciciretti, 2009;FT, 2010)."", 'In such a narrative (c.f.', ""McDowell, 2011), these failures are multiple and are manifest in the actions of 'greedy bankers', irrational exuberance and speculative' lending activity (c.f."", 'Greenspan, 2008;Tett, 2009;Wolf, 2009;Cable, 2010).']",0,"['The financial crisis that gripped the global financial system in the latter half of 2007 has prompted had significant and far-reaching re-evaluation of orthodox market theories and their associated neoliberal policy prescriptions (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2008;Kay, 2009;Norfield, 2010), and this has persisted -if not deepened -with the sovereign debt crisis in the EU since 2010 (Lane, 2010;Mody and Sandri,2012).']"

By revisiting the early literature on embeddedness - in particular the seminal work of Karl Polanyi and Mark Granovetter - and critically engaging with what I will call an 'overterritorialized' concept, a different view on the fundamental categories of embeddedness is proposed.

Research Question/Issue: Conventional regulatory reforms of the financial system focus on standard economic assumptions of self-interested, rational actors. The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and similar financial failures highlight that there are limits to this approach. Instead we use a norm-based (or soft law) perspective to examine how the systemic problems underlying the GFC lay not so much in neo-classical economic assumptions of self-interest, but in unchecked financial innovation exploited by norms of buyer beware and ratings agency reliance among market participants. Fueled by sector-wide remuneration practices, these norms created information asymmetries that fundamentally undermined the integrity of the market. Research Findings/Insights: We present a model that highlights how investment banks, as professional service firms, have superior information to their clients. This presents an information asymmetry problem whereby they can exploit the market norm of caveat emptor (buyer beware) when developing innovative financial transactions. We propose a model highlighting how flawed financial innovation can lead to widespread, systemic problems of assessing and pricing risk because market participants can actively develop and promote flawed transactions. This problem is exacerbated where there is an over-reliance on credit ratings agencies (due to the high information and search costs facing buyers) and a reduced emphasis on director fiduciary duties in financial Special Purpose Entities. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Social norms that underpin financial markets are central to market regulation. Our approach provides a re-examination of the often unquestioned use of universal norms for differing market transactions in the financial sector. Researchers need to explore the interaction between social norms and market contexts (such as financial innovation) to better understand the behavior of financial markets. We contend that a mismatch between norms and market mechanisms can lead to significant unintended outcomes. Our approach of combining soft law (norms) and hard law (regulation) approaches to regulation provides added insights into agency, stewardship, and institutional theories. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Regulators need to understand norms and financial market contexts to develop better legislative interventions. Specifically, differentiating between transaction types in financial markets will address the problems associated with information and search costs facing buyers of flawed financial innovation. We also provide proposals for policy makers seeking to embed accountability for risk taking across the key participants in the financial system to minimize market distortions in the majority of the financial sector.","The financial crisis that gripped the global financial system in the latter half of 2007 has prompted had significant and far-reaching re-evaluation of orthodox market theories and their associated neoliberal policy prescriptions (Cooper, 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2009;Norfield, 2010), and this has persisted -if not deepened -with the sovereign debt crisis in the EU since 2010 (Lane, 2010;Mody and Sandri,2012).","[""In the last couple of years, the concept of the 'market' has once again come to the fore in both policy and social scientific debates."", 'The financial crisis that gripped the global financial system in the latter half of 2007 has prompted had significant and far-reaching re-evaluation of orthodox market theories and their associated neoliberal policy prescriptions (Cooper, 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2009;Norfield, 2010), and this has persisted -if not deepened -with the sovereign debt crisis in the EU since 2010 (Lane, 2010;Mody and Sandri,2012).', 'In both social scientific and policy discussion, the unprecedented scale of the crisis has even led to a significant questioning of the value of hegemonic economic theories concerning market behaviours and the capacity of economic models to accurately replicate or predict the nature of markets (FT, 2008;Allington et al., 2011).', ""Both policy commentators and social scientists have widely argued that significant aspects of the financial crisis can be attributed to various forms of 'market failure' (Washington Post, 2008;Aysen Doyran, 2011;Akinbami, 2011;Greenspan, 2008)."", ""Consequently, a key element of mainstream policy re-sponses to the financial crisis and the subsequent global recession have been framed in terms of a discussion about how to rectify markets 'not working properly' or preventing actors undertaking malpractices that produce 'market failure' (Krugman, 2008;Bagella and Ciciretti, 2009;FT, 2010)."", 'In such a narrative (c.f.', ""McDowell, 2011), these failures are multiple and are manifest in the actions of 'greedy bankers', irrational exuberance and speculative' lending activity (c.f."", 'Greenspan, 2008;Tett, 2009;Wolf, 2009;Cable, 2010).']",0,"['The financial crisis that gripped the global financial system in the latter half of 2007 has prompted had significant and far-reaching re-evaluation of orthodox market theories and their associated neoliberal policy prescriptions (Cooper, 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2009;Norfield, 2010), and this has persisted -if not deepened -with the sovereign debt crisis in the EU since 2010 (Lane, 2010;Mody and Sandri,2012).']"

Therein lies the gap, a gap that is traversed by using an assumed flexibility of ANT which thus allows it to be used as a lens within the interpretivist ontology. The ontology of interpretvism deems the interpreter to be in a position to construct reality in his/her mind whereas, ANT accentuates that reality is actually constructed by the interplay of more actors (both human and non human) and this reality emerges from this interaction. Therefore for interpretivism, reality is created in the mind and for ANT, reality emerges 'out there'.

Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial involving 1873 patients with mild-to-moderate, asymptomatic aortic stenosis. The patients received either 40 mg of simvastatin plus 10 mg of ezetimibe or placebo daily. The primary outcome was a composite of major cardiovascular events, including death from cardiovascular causes, aortic-valve replacement, nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris, heart failure, coronary-artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention, and nonhemorrhagic stroke. Secondary outcomes were events related to aortic-valve stenosis and ischemic cardiovascular events. Results: During a median follow-up of 52.2 months, the primary outcome occurred in 333 patients (35.3%) in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group and in 355 patients (38.2%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.12; P=0.59).

Analyses are based on 9590 men and women followed up for mortality until April 30, 2009. Socioeconomic position was derived from civil service employment grade (high, intermediate, and low) at baseline. Smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, and physical activity were assessed 4 times during the follow-up period.Main Outcome Measures All-cause and cause-specific mortality.Results A total of 654 participants died during the follow-up period. In the analyses adjusted for sex and year of birth, those with the lowest socioeconomic position had 1.60 times higher risk of death from all causes than those with the highest socioeconomic position (a rate difference of 1.94/1000 person-years). This association was attenuated by 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21%-94%) when health behaviors assessed at baseline were entered into the model and by 72% (95% CI, 42%-154%) when they were entered as time-dependent covariates. The corresponding attenuations were 29% (95% CI, 11%-54%) and 45% (95% CI, 24%-79%) for cardiovascular mortality and 61% (95% CI, 16%-425%) and 94% (95% CI, 35%-595%) for noncancer and noncardiovascular mortality. The difference between the baseline only and repeated assessments of health behaviors was mostly due to an increased explanatory power of diet (from 7% to 17% for all-cause mortality, respectively), physical activity (from 5% to 21% for all-cause mortality), and alcohol consumption (from 3% to 12% for all-cause mortality). The role of smoking, the strongest mediator in these analyses, did not change when using baseline or repeat assessments (from 32% to 35% for all-cause mortality).Conclusion In a civil service population in London, England, there was an association between socioeconomic position and mortality that was substantially accounted for by adjustment for health behaviors, particularly when the behaviors were assessed repeatedly.

Although differential mortality decline for cardiovascular diseases has been suggested as an important contributory factor, it is not known what its quantitative contribution was, and to what extent other causes of death have contributed to the widening gap in total mortality.We collected data on mortality by educational level and occupational class among men and women from national longitudinal studies in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, England/Wales, and Italy (Turin), and analysed age-standardized death rates in two recent time periods (1981-1985 and 1991-1995), both total mortality and by cause of death. For simplicity, we report on inequalities in mortality between two broad socioeconomic groups (high and low educational level, non-manual and manual occupations).Relative inequalities in total mortality have increased in all six countries, but absolute differences in total mortality were fairly stable, with the exception of Finland where an increase occurred. In most countries, mortality from cardiovascular diseases declined proportionally faster in the upper socioeconomic groups. The exception is Italy (Turin) where the reverse occurred. In all countries with the exception of Italy (Turin), changes in cardiovascular disease mortality contributed about half of the widening relative gap for total mortality. Other causes also made important contributions to the widening gap in total mortality. For these causes, widening inequalities were sometimes due to increasing mortality rates in the lower socioeconomic groups. We found rising rates of mortality from lung cancer, breast cancer, respiratory disease, gastrointestinal disease, and injuries among men and/or women in lower socioeconomic groups in several countries.Reducing socioeconomic inequalities in mortality in Western Europe critically depends upon speeding up mortality declines from cardiovascular diseases in lower socioeconomic groups, and countering mortality increases from several other causes of death in lower socioeconomic groups.","Substantial differences in mortality between socioeconomic groups, however, are still observed and might even be increasing in Europe [3][4]#AUTHOR_TAG.","['In the last decades life expectancy in industrialised countries has shown a remarkable increase [1,2].', 'Substantial differences in mortality between socioeconomic groups, however, are still observed and might even be increasing in Europe [3][4]#AUTHOR_TAG.', 'These inequalities are one of the most important challenges of public health [6].', 'Cross-country comparisons can help identify the scope for reduction.', 'Europe is a unique region in this respect, as the magnitude of inequalities in health has been shown to differ substantially between countries [7].']",4,"['Substantial differences in mortality between socioeconomic groups, however, are still observed and might even be increasing in Europe [3][4]#AUTHOR_TAG.']"

Design: Comparison of cause of death in manual and non-manual classes, using data on mortality from national studies. Setting: Eleven western European countries in the period 1980-9. Subjects: Men aged 45-59 years at death. Results: A north-south gradient was observed: mortality from ischaemic heart disease was strongly related to occupational class in England and Wales, Ireland, Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, but not in France, Switzerland, and Mediterranean countries. In the latter countries, cancers other than lung cancer and gastrointestinal diseases made a large contribution to class differences in total mortality. Inequalities in lung cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and external causes of death also varied greatly between countries. Conclusions: These variations in cause specific mortality indicate large differences between countries in the contribution that disease specific risk factors like smoking and alcohol consumption make to socioeconomic inequalities in mortality. The mortality advantage of people in higher occupational classes is independent of the precise diseases and risk factors involved.","These mostly focused on the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, and not always took economically inactive persons into account, due to lacking information on their occupational class #AUTHOR_TAG[9][10].","['Most previous comparative research documented educational differences in mortality.', 'Only a few studies have analysed occupational class differences in mortality across Europe.', 'These mostly focused on the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, and not always took economically inactive persons into account, due to lacking information on their occupational class #AUTHOR_TAG[9][10].', 'Inactive persons , generally have a higher mortality when compared with active persons from the same occupational class, and more often have a manual occupation [11].', 'Therefore, disregarding them in mortality analyses by occupational class can lead to an underestimation of mortality differences [11].']",5,"['These mostly focused on the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, and not always took economically inactive persons into account, due to lacking information on their occupational class #AUTHOR_TAG[9][10].']"

We compared the magnitude of inequalities in mortality and self-assessed health among 22 countries in all parts of Europe. METHODS We obtained data on mortality according to education level and occupational class from census-based mortality studies. Deaths were classified according to cause, including common causes, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer; causes related to smoking; causes related to alcohol use; and causes amenable to medical intervention, such as tuberculosis and hypertension. Data on self-assessed health, smoking, and obesity according to education and income were obtained from health or multipurpose surveys. For each country, the association between socioeconomic status and health outcomes was measured with the use of regression-based inequality indexes. RESULTS In almost all countries, the rates of death and poorer self-assessments of health were substantially higher in groups of lower socioeconomic status, but the magnitude of the inequalities between groups of higher and lower socioeconomic status was much larger in some countries than in others. Inequalities in mortality were small in some southern European countries and very large in most countries in the eastern and Baltic regions. These variations among countries appeared to be attributable in part to causes of death related to smoking or alcohol use or amenable to medical intervention. The magnitude of inequalities in self-assessed health also varied substantially among countries, but in a different pattern. CONCLUSIONS We observed variation across Europe in the magnitude of inequalities in health associated with socioeconomic status. These inequalities might be reduced by improving educational opportunities, income distribution, health-related behavior, or access to health care.","Europe is a unique region in this respect, as the magnitude of inequalities in health has been shown to differ substantially between countries #AUTHOR_TAG.","['In the last decades life expectancy in industrialised countries has shown a remarkable increase [1,2].', 'Substantial differences in mortality between socioeconomic groups, however, are still observed and might even be increasing in Europe [3][4][5].', 'These inequalities are one of the most important challenges of public health [6].', 'Cross-country comparisons can help identify the scope for reduction.', 'Europe is a unique region in this respect, as the magnitude of inequalities in health has been shown to differ substantially between countries #AUTHOR_TAG.']",4,"['Europe is a unique region in this respect, as the magnitude of inequalities in health has been shown to differ substantially between countries #AUTHOR_TAG.']"

Contributions from experts in a range of fields examine the causes, direction and impact of changes, investigating whether support for egalitarian policies is diminishing and whether policies are becoming less effective at reducing inequalities.

METHODS Records of the 1970, 1975, 1980 and 1985 censuses on Finnish men and women aged 35-64 linked with records of all deaths during 1971-1990.   RESULTS Exclusion of the economically inactive population underestimates the class differences in the total population by about 25% among men and 60% among women. The bias does not disappear if the first 5 years of follow-up are excluded and the bias can lead to erroneous conclusions about the trends in social class differences in mortality.   CONCLUSIONS Analyses based on the economically active population may lead to significant underestimation of social class differences in mortality, introduce biases in international comparison and may only partially capture the causal mechanisms underlying these mortality differences. Our results further show that although the bias diminishes during the follow-up, it is by no means eliminated after the first 5 years. The underestimation of social class differences in mortality created by the exclusion of the inactive should be more widely recognized and more accurate data on previous occupations should be collected.","Inactive persons , generally have a higher mortality when compared with active persons from the same occupational class, and more often have a manual occupation #AUTHOR_TAG.","['Most previous comparative research documented educational differences in mortality.', 'Only a few studies have analysed occupational class differences in mortality across Europe.', 'These mostly focused on the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, and not always took economically inactive persons into account, due to lacking information on their occupational class [8][9][10].', 'Inactive persons , generally have a higher mortality when compared with active persons from the same occupational class, and more often have a manual occupation #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Therefore, disregarding them in mortality analyses by occupational class can lead to an underestimation of mortality differences [11].']",0,"['Most previous comparative research documented educational differences in mortality.', 'Only a few studies have analysed occupational class differences in mortality across Europe.', 'These mostly focused on the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, and not always took economically inactive persons into account, due to lacking information on their occupational class [8][9][10].', 'Inactive persons , generally have a higher mortality when compared with active persons from the same occupational class, and more often have a manual occupation #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Therefore, disregarding them in mortality analyses by occupational class can lead to an underestimation of mortality differences [11].']"

Other indicators of socioeconomic position (SEP) might, however, be equally or even more discriminatory. This study examined the extent to which smoking behavior is related to other socioeconomic indicators in addition to educational level. Data were derived from the European Household Panel. We selected data for 45,765 respondents aged 25-60 years from nine European countries. The association between six different SEP indicators and smoking prevalence was examined using prevalence rate ratios (RRs) estimated through log linear regression analyses. In univariate analyses, most selected SEP indicators were associated with smoking. In multivariate analyses, educational level, occupational class, accumulated wealth (measured by household assets), and housing tenure retained independent effects on smoking (RRs about 1.20). The effects observed for activity status and household income were small and insignificant in nearly all populations. In northern Europe, educational level had the greatest predictive value in the younger age groups; occupational class and housing tenure predicted most of smoking prevalence in the older age groups. The results showed a less pronounced and more varied pattern in southern Europe. Our results indicate that smoking prevalence is related not only to educational level but also to occupational class and measures of accumulated wealth (other than income). These measures should be used in addition to educational level to identify groups at increased risk for smoking.","Not only during adolescence, but also in adulthood healthy behaviours may be encouraged or discouraged by the social environment, and health-related behaviours may therefore be as strongly or even more strongly related to occupational class as it is to education [#AUTHOR_TAG,53].","['Health behaviour is one of the most frequently discussed explanatory factors for the association between occupational class and mortality [51,52].', 'Not only during adolescence, but also in adulthood healthy behaviours may be encouraged or discouraged by the social environment, and health-related behaviours may therefore be as strongly or even more strongly related to occupational class as it is to education [#AUTHOR_TAG,53].', 'Smoking could be one explanation for differences in occupational class inequalitiesnot least for CVD mortality -between Northern and Southern European populations [54].', 'While in Northern Europe smoking has declined in higher socioeconomic classes, leading to an increase in relative inequalities in smoking [55], in Southern Europe relatively high rates of smoking are still found in higher socioeconomic classes [53].', 'Differences in excessive alcohol consumption may also explain part of the occupational class inequalities in cancer and CVD mortality.', 'This could be especially true in countries such as Finland, Denmark, France, Scotland, and Lithuania where high alcohol consumption rates have been reported [56,57] and higher levels of binge drinking were found in lower socioeconomic groups [58].', 'This may also partly explain the large inequalities in mortality from external causes in some of these populations.']",0,"['Health behaviour is one of the most frequently discussed explanatory factors for the association between occupational class and mortality [51,52].', 'Not only during adolescence, but also in adulthood healthy behaviours may be encouraged or discouraged by the social environment, and health-related behaviours may therefore be as strongly or even more strongly related to occupational class as it is to education [#AUTHOR_TAG,53].', 'Smoking could be one explanation for differences in occupational class inequalitiesnot least for CVD mortality -between Northern and Southern European populations [54].', 'While in Northern Europe smoking has declined in higher socioeconomic classes, leading to an increase in relative inequalities in smoking [55], in Southern Europe relatively high rates of smoking are still found in higher socioeconomic classes [53].', 'Differences in excessive alcohol consumption may also explain part of the occupational class inequalities in cancer and CVD mortality.', 'This could be especially true in countries such as Finland, Denmark, France, Scotland, and Lithuania where high alcohol consumption rates have been reported [56,57] and higher levels of binge drinking were found in lower socioeconomic groups [58].', 'This may also partly explain the large inequalities in mortality from external causes in some of these populations.']"

A common social class scheme was applied to most data sets. The magnitude of mortality differences was quantified by three summary indices. Three major data problems were identified and their potential effect on inequality estimates was quantified for each country individually. For men 45-59 years, the mortality rate ratio comparing manual classes to non-manual classes was about equally large for four Nordic countries, England and Wales, Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Relatively large ratios were only observed for France. The same applied to men 60 64 years (data for only 5 countries, including France).

Figures published previously1,2 were based largely on social class at entry to the study from 1971 onwards. By looking at figures based on social class at or after subsequent censuses (in 1981 and 1991), it is confirmed that some of the initial widening in inequalities between Social Classes I and V since 1971 can be attributed to health selection effects. However, average deviation across all social classes, shows a steady widening of the social gradient that is largely unaffected by health selection. The analyses also suggests that, as an indirect effect of greater longevity, measures of inequality in life expectancy are less reliable when calculated using predominantly 1991 social class than when using 1971 or 1981 social class. This has implications for the use of the new National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) for monitoring these inequalities. The narrowing of differences in male life expectancy between Social Classes I and V in the 1990s was examined. This was due to an above average improvement in the life expectancy of those in Social Class V that began in the early 1990s.","Substantial differences in mortality between socioeconomic groups, however, are still observed and might even be increasing in Europe [3]#AUTHOR_TAG[5].","['In the last decades life expectancy in industrialised countries has shown a remarkable increase [1,2].', 'Substantial differences in mortality between socioeconomic groups, however, are still observed and might even be increasing in Europe [3]#AUTHOR_TAG[5].', 'These inequalities are one of the most important challenges of public health [6].', 'Cross-country comparisons can help identify the scope for reduction.', 'Europe is a unique region in this respect, as the magnitude of inequalities in health has been shown to differ substantially between countries [7].']",4,"['In the last decades life expectancy in industrialised countries has shown a remarkable increase [1,2].', 'Substantial differences in mortality between socioeconomic groups, however, are still observed and might even be increasing in Europe [3]#AUTHOR_TAG[5].']"

Methods: The data derive from the surveys of the Helsinki health study, collected in 2000, 2001, and 2002 from 40-60 year old employees working for the City of Helsinki (n = 8970, response rate 67%). The study measured occupation based social class and Karasek's demand-control model. The health outcomes were self rated health as less than good and limiting longstanding illness. Age adjusted prevalence percentages and fitted logistic regression models were calculated. Results: The individual effects of social class and psychosocial working conditions on self rated health and limiting longstanding illness were strong among both men and women. The relation between social class and both health outcomes considerably attenuated when job control was controlled for, but was reinforced when controlling for job demands. Controlling for both job control and job demands attenuated the relation between social class and self rated health and limiting longstanding illness among women, however, was reinforced among men. Conclusions: A substantial part of the relation between social class and health could be attributed to job control, however, job demands reinforced the relation. Although the effect of social class is mediated by psychosocial working conditions, both social class and working conditions were related to health after mutual adjustments.","These risk factors include physical risk factors such as exposure to noise and pollution, heavy lifting, and risk of injuries, as well as psychosocial risk factors like low prestige, demand and control imbalance, and income deprivation [14,[40][41]#AUTHOR_TAG.","['Specific occupational health risks are generally more prevalent in lower occupational classes, and are likely to explain part of the association between occupational class and mortality [39].', 'These risk factors include physical risk factors such as exposure to noise and pollution, heavy lifting, and risk of injuries, as well as psychosocial risk factors like low prestige, demand and control imbalance, and income deprivation [14,[40][41]#AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Psychosocial factors have been associated with inequalities in CVD mortality [43,44] whereas exposure to hazards in industries has been shown to explain some of the occupational class differences in cancer mortality [45][46][47][48].']",0,"['Specific occupational health risks are generally more prevalent in lower occupational classes, and are likely to explain part of the association between occupational class and mortality [39].', 'These risk factors include physical risk factors such as exposure to noise and pollution, heavy lifting, and risk of injuries, as well as psychosocial risk factors like low prestige, demand and control imbalance, and income deprivation [14,[40][41]#AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Psychosocial factors have been associated with inequalities in CVD mortality [43,44] whereas exposure to hazards in industries has been shown to explain some of the occupational class differences in cancer mortality [45][46][47][48].']"

Its influence on stress-related disease risks is analysed with the help of standardised measurements based on theoretical models. Two such models have gained special prominence in recent years, the demand-control model and the effort-reward imbalance model. The former model places its emphasis on a distinct combination of job characteristics, whereas the latter model's focus is on the imbalance between efforts spent and rewards received in turn. The predictive power of these models with respect to coronary or cardiovascular disease and depression was tested in a number of prospective epidemiological investigations. In summary, twofold elevated disease risks are observed. Effects on cardiovascular disease are particularly pronounced among men, whereas no gender differences are observed for depression. Additional evidence derived from experimental and ambulatory monitoring studies supplements this body of findings. Current scientific evidence justifies an increased awareness and assessment of these newly discovered occupational risks, in particular by occupational health professionals. Moreover, structural and interpersonal measures of stress prevention and health promotion at work are warranted, with special emphasis on gender differences.","Psychosocial factors have been associated with inequalities in CVD mortality [43,#AUTHOR_TAG] whereas exposure to hazards in industries has been shown to explain some of the occupational class differences in cancer mortality [45][46][47][48].","['Specific occupational health risks are generally more prevalent in lower occupational classes, and are likely to explain part of the association between occupational class and mortality [39].', 'These risk factors include physical risk factors such as exposure to noise and pollution, heavy lifting, and risk of injuries, as well as psychosocial risk factors like low prestige, demand and control imbalance, and income deprivation [14,[40][41][42].', 'Psychosocial factors have been associated with inequalities in CVD mortality [43,#AUTHOR_TAG] whereas exposure to hazards in industries has been shown to explain some of the occupational class differences in cancer mortality [45][46][47][48].']",0,"['Specific occupational health risks are generally more prevalent in lower occupational classes, and are likely to explain part of the association between occupational class and mortality [39].', 'These risk factors include physical risk factors such as exposure to noise and pollution, heavy lifting, and risk of injuries, as well as psychosocial risk factors like low prestige, demand and control imbalance, and income deprivation [14,[40][41][42].', 'Psychosocial factors have been associated with inequalities in CVD mortality [43,#AUTHOR_TAG] whereas exposure to hazards in industries has been shown to explain some of the occupational class differences in cancer mortality [45][46][47][48].']"

The liberalization of trade policy in many developing countries has helped foster the growth of these flows. Preceding and concurrent with this move to free trade, there has been a global movement toward democracy. We argue that these two trends are related: democratization of the political system reduces the ability of governments to use trade barriers as a strategy for building political support. Political leaders in labor-rich countries may prefer lower trade barriers as democracy increases. Empirical evidence supports our claim about the developing countries from 1970 99. Regime change toward democracy is associated with trade liberalization, controlling for many factors.

Taking recent theoretical work as a point of departure, they ask which theoretical findings are supported and which are contradicted by the facts. The results are based on comparisons of political institutions across countries or time, in a large sample of contemporary democracies. They find that presidential/parliamentary and majoritarian/proportional dichotomies influence several economic variables: presidential regimes induce smaller public sectors, and proportional elections lead to greater and less targeted government spending and larger budget deficits. Moreover, the details of the electoral system (such as district magnitude and ballot structure) influence corruption and structural policies toward economic growth.Persson and Tabellini's goal is to draw conclusions about the causal effects of constitutions on policy outcomes. But since constitutions are not randomly assigned to countries, how the constitutional system was selected in the first place must be taken into account. This raises challenging methodological problems, which are addressed in the book. The study is therefore important not only in its findings but also in establishing a methodology for empirical analysis in the field of comparative politics.","Political institutions affect (economic) policy making by shaping the rules of the game and determine the context in which key policy decisions are made, such as redistribution of income and the provision of public goods (#AUTHOR_TAG and Tabellini, 2003).","['The relationship between democracy and growth has received much attention in the recent literature.', 'Cross-country studies on the impact of democratic institutions on growth yield ambiguous and inconclusive results (Barro, 1997;Glaeser et al. 2004).', 'Even studies exploiting the within country variation in the data still show that transitions towards democracy are not necessarily associated with large improvements in economic outcomes (Rodrik and Wacziarg, 2005;Giavazzi and Tabellini, 2005;Persson andTabellini, 2006, 2008).', 'Furthermore, the direction of causation is hard to establish (see Acemoglu et al., 2008;Gundlach and Paldam, 2009).', 'Crucial questions in this debate of course are about the mechanism of how political institutions affect economic growth.', 'In this respect, government policies should play a key role.', 'Political institutions affect (economic) policy making by shaping the rules of the game and determine the context in which key policy decisions are made, such as redistribution of income and the provision of public goods (#AUTHOR_TAG and Tabellini, 2003).']",5,"['Political institutions affect (economic) policy making by shaping the rules of the game and determine the context in which key policy decisions are made, such as redistribution of income and the provision of public goods (#AUTHOR_TAG and Tabellini, 2003).']"

It was a coup long expected, and Fiji's fourth since 1987. Internationally, the response was swift imposing sanctions and removing or delaying international aid programmes. This has a potentially significant impact on Fiji because it is one of the largest per capita recipients of developmental aid funding in the world. However, it may also have little impact because, despite such assistance, the Fijian GDP has stagnated with an average growth of under 1% for the last 20 years. Other developmental indicators are also bleak. This thesis thus examines the dichotomy between Fiji's ODA and its apparent inability to arrest the decline of the Fijian lifestyle and economy. However, to review all international developmental programmes across all sectors of Fijian society, while maintaining contemporary relevance and coherency, is untenable. Therefore, the thesis will focus on the European Union and its external relations with Fiji. The EU is one of the most influential partners for Fiji and is often overlooked by scholars, allowing this thesis to make a valuable contribution to developmental studies in the pacific region. The thesis has selected and examines four sectors of Fijian society, that of the Economy, Governance, Sugar, and Education sectors. This is because they are the sectors that the European Union is presently devoting most attention. Therefore, these areas best illustrate Fijian reaction to the importance and effectiveness of EU involvement. Overall, the thesis intends to demonstrate both the efficacy and the attitudes of local representatives to foreign aid programmes, and ultimately provide a unique 'inside looking out' perspective not typical of publications about Fiji",Similar mechanisms that imply a different fiscal policy between a democracy and an autocracy are proposed by #AUTHOR_TAG (1993) and McGuire and Olson (1996).,"['Similar mechanisms that imply a different fiscal policy between a democracy and an autocracy are proposed by #AUTHOR_TAG (1993) and McGuire and Olson (1996).', 'They argue that autocracies tend to tax more and spend less for general public goods than democracies.']",0,['Similar mechanisms that imply a different fiscal policy between a democracy and an autocracy are proposed by #AUTHOR_TAG (1993) and McGuire and Olson (1996).']

Our semi-parametric matching estimates show that parametric methods might underestimate the true effect of democracy on agricultural protection. We find a strong increase in agricultural protection (reduce in taxation) after a country transition to democracy. Specifically a democratic transition increases agricultural protection by about 9 percent points. However, the effect is asymmetric as the effect of leaving democracy on protection is close to zero.

We employ a newly constructed data-set of permanent democratic transitions during the so-called Third Wave of Democratization and examine the within effect of democratization in countries that abandoned autocracy and consolidated representative institutions. We study democratization in a before-after event study approach that enables us to control for time-invariant country-specific effects and general time trends. The panel estimates imply that on average democratizations are associated with a one half to one percent increase in annual per capita growth. The dynamic analysis also reveals a J-shaped growth pattern: during the transition growth is slow and on average negative; in the medium and especially long run, however, growth stabilizes at a higher level. The evidence supports ""development"" theories of democracy and growth that highlight the positive impact of representative institutions on economic activity.

CC2672,6560220,Political Reforms and Public Policies: Evidence from Agricultural Protection,Alessandro Olper,Toward a More General Theory of Regulation,"[""Sam Peltzman""]","In previous literature, George Stigler asserts a law of diminishing returns to group size in politics: Beyond some point it becomes counterproductive to dilute the per capita transfer. Since the total transfer is endogenous, there is a corollary that dirninishing returns apply to the transfer as well, due both to the opposition provoked by the transfer and to the demand this opposition exerts on resources to quiet it. Stigler does not himself formalize this model, and my first task will be to do just this.

Democracy, Inequality, and Growth in Historical Perspective","[""D. Acemoglu"", ""J. A.

We argue that these political reforms can be viewed as strategic decisions by the political elite to prevent widespread social unrest and revolution. Political transition, rather than redistribution under existing political institutions, occurs because current transfers do not ensure future transfers, while the extension of the franchise changes future political equilibria and acts as a commitment to redistribution. Our theory also offers a novel explanation for the Kuznets curve in many Western economies during this period, with the fall in inequality following redistribution due to democratization.","Based on this logic, #AUTHOR_TAG and Robinson (2000;2006) predict redistribution from the elite to the citizens after an extension of voting rights.","['The first view, which largely derives from models based on the median voter theorem (Downs, 1957), emphasizes that in democracies the distribution of political power is typically more equal than the distribution of income and wealth.', 'As a consequence, voting models predict that democracies tend to redistribute from the rich to the poor, and this effect will be stronger with higher income inequality as the middle-class has more incentives to form coalitions with the poor (see Alesina and Rodrik, 1994;Persson and Tabellini, 1994).', 'Based on this logic, #AUTHOR_TAG and Robinson (2000;2006) predict redistribution from the elite to the citizens after an extension of voting rights.']",0,"['The first view, which largely derives from models based on the median voter theorem (Downs, 1957), emphasizes that in democracies the distribution of political power is typically more equal than the distribution of income and wealth.', 'As a consequence, voting models predict that democracies tend to redistribute from the rich to the poor, and this effect will be stronger with higher income inequality as the middle-class has more incentives to form coalitions with the poor (see Alesina and Rodrik, 1994;Persson and Tabellini, 1994).', 'Based on this logic, #AUTHOR_TAG and Robinson (2000;2006) predict redistribution from the elite to the citizens after an extension of voting rights.']"
CC2674,6560220,Political Reforms and Public Policies: Evidence from Agricultural Protection,Alessandro Olper,Is Inequality Harmful for Growth?,"[""Torsten Persson"", ""Guido Tabellini""]","Is inequality harmful for growth? We suggest that it is. To summarize our main argument: in a society where distributional conflict is more important, political decisions are more likely to produce economic policies that allow private individuals to appropriate less of the returns to growth promoting activities, such as accumulation of capital and productive knowledge. In the paper we first formulate a theoretical model that formally captures this idea. The model has a politico-economic equilibrium, which determines a sequence of growth rates depending on structural parameters, political institutions, and initial conditions. We then confront the testable empirical implications with two sets of data. A first data set pools historical evidence-which goes back to the mid 19th century-from the US and eight European countries. A second data set contains post-war evidence from a broad cross-section of developed and less developed countries. In both samples we find a statistically significant and quantitatively important negative relation between inequality and growth. After a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, we conclude that our findings are not distorted by measurement error, reverse causation, hetroskedasticity, or other econometric problems.","As a consequence, voting models predict that democracies tend to redistribute from the rich to the poor, and this effect will be stronger with higher income inequality as the middle-class has more incentives to form coalitions with the poor (see Alesina and Rodrik, 1994;#AUTHOR_TAG and Tabellini, 1994).","['The first view, which largely derives from models based on the median voter theorem (Downs, 1957), emphasizes that in democracies the distribution of political power is typically more equal than the distribution of income and wealth.', 'As a consequence, voting models predict that democracies tend to redistribute from the rich to the poor, and this effect will be stronger with higher income inequality as the middle-class has more incentives to form coalitions with the poor (see Alesina and Rodrik, 1994;#AUTHOR_TAG and Tabellini, 1994).', 'Based on this logic, Acemoglu and Robinson (2000;2006) predict redistribution from the elite to the citizens after an extension of voting rights.']",0,"['The first view, which largely derives from models based on the median voter theorem (Downs, 1957), emphasizes that in democracies the distribution of political power is typically more equal than the distribution of income and wealth.', 'As a consequence, voting models predict that democracies tend to redistribute from the rich to the poor, and this effect will be stronger with higher income inequality as the middle-class has more incentives to form coalitions with the poor (see Alesina and Rodrik, 1994;#AUTHOR_TAG and Tabellini, 1994).']"

We review recent attempts to address this question, which exploit the within-country variation associated with historical transitions in and out of democracy. The answer is positive, but depends %u2013 in a subtle way %u2013 on the details of democratic reforms. First, democratizations and economic liberalizations in isolation each induce growth accelerations, but countries liberalizing their economy before extending political rights do better than those carrying out the opposite sequence. Second, different forms of democratic government and different electoral systems lead to different fiscal trade policies: this might explain why new presidential democracies grow faster than new parliamentary democracies.

Using rich nonexperimental data, we examine the performance of a two-stage evaluation methodology that (a) estimates the probability that a person participates in a programme and (b) uses the estimated probability in extensions of the classical method of matching. We decompose the conventional measure of programme evaluation bias into several components and find that bias due to selection on unobservables, commonly called selection bias in econometrics, is empirically less important than other components, although it is still a sizeable fraction of the estimated programme impact. Matching methods applied to comparison groups located in the same labour markets as participants and administered the same questionnaire eliminate much of the bias as conventionally measured, but the remaining bias is a considerable fraction of experimentally-determined programme impact estimates. We test and reject the identifying assumptions that justify the classical method of matching. We present a nonparametric conditional difference-in-differences extension of the method of matching that is consistent with the classical index-sufficient sample selection model and is not rejected by our tests of identifying assumptions.

Price support policies of advanced economies hurt not only domestic consumers and exporters of other products but also foreign producers and traders of farm products, and they reduce national and global economic welfare. On the other hand, the governments of many developing countries have directly taxed their farmers over the past half-century, both directly (e.g., export taxes) and also indirectly via overvaluing their currency and restricting imports of manufactures. Thus the price incentives facing farmers in many developing countries have been depressed by both own-country and other countries' agricultural price and international trade policies. The authors summarize these and realted stylized facts that can be drawn from a new World Bank database that is worthy of the attention of political economy theorists, historians and econometricians. These indicators can be helpful in addressing such questions as the following: where is there still a policy bias against agricultural production? To what extent has there been overshooting in the sense that some developing-country food producers are now being protected from import competition along the lines of the examples of earlier-industrializing Europe and Japan? What are the political economy forces behind the more-successful reformers, and how do they compare with those in less-successful countries where major distortions in agricultural incentives remain?

The analysis indicates that more authoritarian regimes are associated with higher trade protec-tion and greater labor market distortions. This supports the view that political authoritarianism may be counterproductive to development in important respects. The link between the political system of a country and its economic growth has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years (for an extensive survey of the literature see Alesina and Perotti 1994). Empirical studies have yielded mixed results, and a survey of the literature by Przeworski and Limongi (1993) con-cluded that they did not know whether democracy fosters or hinders economic growth. Authors from Friedman (1962) to Scully (1988) have argued that politi-cally open societies grow at faster rates than societies where freedom is restricted. Others such as Kormendi and Meguire (1985) have found a negative relation-ship between civil liberty and growth, and Barro (1994) has argued that more political freedom may encourage a greater role for interest groups in the legisla-tive process, thereby retarding growth. Landell-Mills and Serageldin (1992) sum-marize this literature by concluding that benevolent dictators are rare and that democracies often resort to populist policies that are inimical to growth. The focus of this article is more narrow. We consider labor policies and, to the extent that they influence labor policies, policies affecting the openness of the economy. What, if any, is the link between such policies and the nature of the political regime? Many governments in developing countries have adopted labor policies--including high minimum wages, public sector overemployment, and job security guarantees--that benefit a small group of &quot;insiders. &quot; But these same policies limit the opportunities of &quot;outsiders, &quot; thereby aggravating income inequality, generating efficiency losses, and possibly discouraging investment and growth.

For a given starting level of real per capita GDP, the growth rate is enhanced by higher initial schooling and life expectancy, lower fertility, lower government consumption, better maintenance of the rule of law, lower inflation, and improvements in the terms of trade. For given values of these and other variables, growth is negatively related to the initial level of real per capita GDP. Political freedom has only a weak effect on growth but there is some indication of a nonlinear relation. At low levels of political rights, an expansion of these rights stimulates economic growth. However, once a moderate amount of democracy has been attained, a further expansion reduces growth. In contrast to the small effect of democracy on growth, there is a strong positive influence of the standard of living on a country's propensity to experience democracy.","Cross-country studies on the impact of democratic institutions on growth yield ambiguous and inconclusive results (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1997;Glaeser et al. 2004).","['The relationship between democracy and growth has received much attention in the recent literature.', 'Cross-country studies on the impact of democratic institutions on growth yield ambiguous and inconclusive results (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1997;Glaeser et al. 2004).', 'Even studies exploiting the within country variation in the data still show that transitions towards democracy are not necessarily associated with large improvements in economic outcomes (Rodrik and Wacziarg, 2005;Giavazzi and Tabellini, 2005;Persson andTabellini, 2006, 2008).', 'Furthermore, the direction of causation is hard to establish (see Acemoglu et al., 2008;Gundlach and Paldam, 2009).', 'Crucial questions in this debate of course are about the mechanism of how political institutions affect economic growth.', 'In this respect, government policies should play a key role.', 'Political institutions affect (economic) policy making by shaping the rules of the game and determine the context in which key policy decisions are made, such as redistribution of income and the provision of public goods (Persson and Tabellini, 2003).']",0,"['Cross-country studies on the impact of democratic institutions on growth yield ambiguous and inconclusive results (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1997;Glaeser et al. 2004).']"

Over the same period, the body of law that structures most private group health insurance - ERISA - has effectively delegated control of risk pooling and resource allocation to the employers that sponsor group plans. Drawing on a history of ERISA that has not been explored in legal scholarship, I demonstrate how the private welfare state of workplace-based health insurance has evolved into the creation of what amounts to corporate sovereignty in controlling access to health coverage. The discourse of managing risk bonds these two components of health law and the health care system: patient care and access to coverage. From a normative perspective, the greatest problem with risk-centered governance arises from a democracy deficit. Because almost all health insurance risk pools are based in workplaces, there is potential to draw on the social networks created by work as a mechanism for building new, localized publics engaged with health policy. Treating insurance risk pools as potential mechanisms of governance, rather than merely as actuarial units, would force the publicizing (at least within the workplace) of myriad political decisions: who gets included and excluded in the pooling process, how allocation decisions are made, and whether there are systems of accountability and checks and balances sufficient to produce a risk allocation system that is equitable, as well as efficient and flexible. The article builds on the egalitarian potential of social insurance as a technology of governance, and argues for filling a gap that exists not only in the current system, but also in all proposals for reform","For example, #AUTHOR_TAG and Kudamatsu (2006), using panel data, find that health policy interventions are superior in democracies.","['A series of empirical studies have tried to test these predictions using data on democracy and policies.', 'For example, #AUTHOR_TAG and Kudamatsu (2006), using panel data, find that health policy interventions are superior in democracies.', 'Other papers have investigated how democracy affect economic liberalization.', 'De Haan and Sturm (2003), using a developing country sample, show that greater political freedom furthers economic freedom.', 'However, Giavazzi and Tabellini (2005) argue that economic liberalization often precedes political liberalization.']",0,"['For example, #AUTHOR_TAG and Kudamatsu (2006), using panel data, find that health policy interventions are superior in democracies.']"

This paper studies a comparatively neglected aspect of this - the forces that shape heterogeneous performance of autocracies. The paper develops a simple theoretical model of accountability in the absence of regularized elections. Leadership turnover is managed by a selectorate - a group of individuals on whom the leader depends to hold onto power. Good policy is institutionalized when the selectorate removes poorly performing leaders from office. This requires that the selectorate's hold on power is not too dependent on a specific leader being in office. The paper looks empirically at spells of autocracy to establish cases where it has been successful according to various objective criteria. We use these case studies to identify the selectorate in specific instances of successful autocracy. We also show that, consistent with the theory, leadership turnover in successful autocracies is higher than in unsuccessful autocracies. Finally, we show by exploiting leadership deaths from natural causes that successful autocracies appear to have found ways for selectorates to nominate successors without losing power - a feature which is also consistent with the theoretical approach","One possible explanation of such asymmetric effect of transitions to democracy and autocracy could be based on theories explaining (lack of) leadership turnovers and economic performance under autocracies (see #AUTHOR_TAG and Kudamatsu, 2008;Acemoglu et al. 2004).","['A puzzling result of our study is the asymmetric effect of regime change on the level of protection: why should a regime change be relevant only for a transition to democracy, and not vice versa ?', 'One possible explanation of such asymmetric effect of transitions to democracy and autocracy could be based on theories explaining (lack of) leadership turnovers and economic performance under autocracies (see #AUTHOR_TAG and Kudamatsu, 2008;Acemoglu et al. 2004).', 'These studies emphasise the importance of some institutional features of autocracy, in particular political stability.', 'The objective of staying in power could stop a potential policy reversal against the agrarian population by preventing rural unrest.', 'Our data preclude a deeper investigation of this issue but further analysis would certainly constitute a fruitful line of inquiry.']",0,"['One possible explanation of such asymmetric effect of transitions to democracy and autocracy could be based on theories explaining (lack of) leadership turnovers and economic performance under autocracies (see #AUTHOR_TAG and Kudamatsu, 2008;Acemoglu et al. 2004).', 'These studies emphasise the importance of some institutional features of autocracy, in particular political stability.']"

We also present instrumental-variables using two different strategies. These estimates also show no causal effect of income on democracy. Furthermore, we reconcile the positive cross-country correlation between income and democracy with the absence of a causal effect of income on democracy by showing that the long-run evolution of income and democracy is related to historical factors.

We argue that the success of kleptocrats rests, in part, on their ability to use a divide-and-rule' strategy, made possible by weaknesses in the institutions in these societies. Members of society need to cooperate in order to depose a kleptocrat, yet such cooperation may be defused by imposing punitive rates of taxation on any citizen who proposes such a move, and redistributing the benefits to those who need to agree to it. Thus the collective action problem can be intensified by threats which remain off the equilibrium path. In equilibrium, all are exploited and no one challenges the kleptocrat. Kleptocratic policies are more likely when foreign aid and rents from natural resources provide rulers with substantial resources to buy off opponents; when opposition groups are shortsighted; when the average productivity in the economy is low; and when there is greater inequality between producer groups (because more productive groups are more difficult to buy off).","One possible explanation of such asymmetric effect of transitions to democracy and autocracy could be based on theories explaining (lack of) leadership turnovers and economic performance under autocracies (see Besley and Kudamatsu, 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2004).","['A puzzling result of our study is the asymmetric effect of regime change on the level of protection: why should a regime change be relevant only for a transition to democracy, and not vice versa ?', 'One possible explanation of such asymmetric effect of transitions to democracy and autocracy could be based on theories explaining (lack of) leadership turnovers and economic performance under autocracies (see Besley and Kudamatsu, 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2004).', 'These studies emphasise the importance of some institutional features of autocracy, in particular political stability.', 'The objective of staying in power could stop a potential policy reversal against the agrarian population by preventing rural unrest.', 'Our data preclude a deeper investigation of this issue but further analysis would certainly constitute a fruitful line of inquiry.']",0,"['A puzzling result of our study is the asymmetric effect of regime change on the level of protection: why should a regime change be relevant only for a transition to democracy, and not vice versa ?', 'One possible explanation of such asymmetric effect of transitions to democracy and autocracy could be based on theories explaining (lack of) leadership turnovers and economic performance under autocracies (see Besley and Kudamatsu, 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2004).', 'These studies emphasise the importance of some institutional features of autocracy, in particular political stability.']"

We demonstrate this computationally fast technique applied to a range of DEM models simulating broadband imaging data from SDO/AIA and high resolution line spectra from Hinode/EIS, as well as actual active region observations with Hinode/EIS and XRT. As this regularization method naturally provides both vertical and horizontal (temperature resolution) error bars we are able to test the role of uncertainties in the data and response functions. The regularization method is able to successfully recover the DEM from simulated data of a variety of model DEMs (single Gaussian, multiple Gaussians and CHIANTI DEM models). It is able to do this, at best, to over four orders of magnitude in DEM space but typically over two orders of magnitude from peak emission. The combination of horizontal and vertical error bars and the regularized solution matrix allows us to easily determine the accuracy and robustness of the regularized DEM. We find that the typical range for the horizontal errors is $\Delta$log$T\approx 0.1 -0.5$ and this is dependent on the observed signal to noise, uncertainty in the response functions as well as the source model and temperature. With Hinode/EIS an uncertainty of 20% greatly broadens the regularized DEMs for both Gaussian and CHIANTI models although information about the underlying DEMs is still recoverable. When applied to real active region observations with Hinode/EIS and XRT the regularization method is able to recover a DEM similar to that found via a MCMC method but in considerably less computational time.Comment: 15 pages, 17 figures, accepted for publication in A&","In this work, we use the code developed by #AUTHOR_TAG and Kontar (2012) to recover the DEM.","['In this work, we use the code developed by #AUTHOR_TAG and Kontar (2012) to recover the DEM.', 'This code uses an enhanced regularization algorithm, and is capable of providing both vertical and horizontal error bars, i.e., the DEM uncertainty and temperature resolution.', 'By introducing AIA images from the six EUV channels into the code, DEM solutions can be obtained for each individual pixel in the logarithmic temperature range [5.5, 7.5], which are divided into 12 nonuniform bins as defined by the following 13 temperatures: 0.5, 1, 1. 5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 19, 25, and 32 MK, in our study.', 'Furthermore, a DEM-weighted mean temperature T is defined as follows (Cheng et al., 2012):']",5,"['In this work, we use the code developed by #AUTHOR_TAG and Kontar (2012) to recover the DEM.', 'This code uses an enhanced regularization algorithm, and is capable of providing both vertical and horizontal error bars, i.e., the DEM uncertainty and temperature resolution.']"

Using a localization result, we present a new formulation of this problem as a mixed-integer bilinear programming problem. The problem is then reformulated using a reformulation linearization technique (RLT) as a linear mixed-integer problem that is shown to possess a tight linear programming relaxation. A branch-and-bound algorithm is then designed to implicitly enumerate over the location decision variable space. The special structure of the underlying linear programming relaxation is exploited to derive quick lower bounds via a suitable Lagrangian dual formulation. This methodology enables us to solve larger problem than heretofore solvable, and affords provably good quality heuristic solutions upon premature termination.

A discretisation technique that divides a continuous space into a discrete number of cells while embedding the use of restricted regions within the search is also presented.

This can be the introduction of bus stops along some given bus routes, or of railway stations along the tracks in a railway network. The positive effect of new stops is given by the better access of the potential customers to their closest station, while the increasement of travel time caused by the additional stopping activities of the trains leads to a negative effect. The goal is to cover all given demand points with a minimal amount of additional traveling time, where covering may be defined with respect to an arbitrary norm (or even a gauge). Unfortunately, this problem is NP-hard, even if only the Euclidean distance is used. In this paper, we give a reduction to a finite candidate set leading to a discrete set covering problem. Moreover, we identify network structures in which the coefficient matrix of the resulting set covering problem is totally unimodular, and use this result to derive efficient solution approaches.

After the lag in lung cancer onset, this would result in an additional annual burden of 4700 life years lost and (at peak) 278 deaths. The increases in radon levels for the millions of homes that would contribute most of the additional burden are below the threshold at which radon remediation measures are cost effective. Fitting extraction fans and trickle ventilators to restore ventilation will help offset the additional burden but only if the ventilation related energy efficiency gains are lost. Mechanical ventilation systems with heat recovery may lower radon levels and the risk of cancer while maintaining the advantage of energy efficiency for the most airtight dwellings but there is potential for a major adverse impact on health if such systems fail.Unless specific remediation is used, reducing the ventilation of dwellings will improve energy efficiency only at the expense of population wide adverse impact on indoor exposure to radon and risk of lung cancer. The implications of this and other consequences of changes to ventilation need to be carefully evaluated to ensure that the desirable health and environmental benefits of home energy efficiency are not compromised by avoidable negative impacts on indoor air quality.","hile current English building regulations requires that adequate means of ventilation is provided to dwellings, #AUTHOR_TAG there is a lack of guidance for determining the level of ventilation required to protect health before or following an energy efficiency retrofit. 18","['environment in the coming decades and these are likely to have major impacts on the indoor environment and population health. 4 5', 'To date, health consequences have received limited examination, 6 though they are increasingly being recognised as an issue by the UK Government. 7', '[10] Energy efficiency retrofits that alter the fabric heat loss can also increase the air tightness of the dwelling, 11 12 increasing exposure to indoor-generated pollutants (eg, particulates, mould, radon).', 'Living in cold or inefficient and poorly ventilated homes is linked to a range of health problems. 5 10 13', 'Retrofits that improve indoor temperatures may have positive impacts on mental health and cardiorespiratory disease, 5 but could have negative impacts on respiratory conditions due to the increased levels of indoor pollutants. 14 15', 'In the UK, most of our time is spent indoors and the majority of the health impact of more airtight buildings is likely to occur over the long term through low-dose exposure. 16', 'hile current English building regulations requires that adequate means of ventilation is provided to dwellings, #AUTHOR_TAG there is a lack of guidance for determining the level of ventilation required to protect health before or following an energy efficiency retrofit. 18', 'The only guidance that exists relates to the replacement of existing window trickle vents.', 'Ultimately, additional ventilation following a retrofit is left to the discretion of the installer or household.', 'The aim of this study is to illustrate the potential health impact of energy efficiency retrofits under different ventilation settings.']",4,"['environment in the coming decades and these are likely to have major impacts on the indoor environment and population health. 4 5', 'hile current English building regulations requires that adequate means of ventilation is provided to dwellings, #AUTHOR_TAG there is a lack of guidance for determining the level of ventilation required to protect health before or following an energy efficiency retrofit. 18']"

This review focuses on empirical verification efforts, although models have also been subjected to analytical verification and inter-model comparisons. In most reports, experimental data were compared to predictions of only one model Ð typically, either the CONTAM or COMIS models. However, inter-model comparisons have demonstrated consistency between these and other multizone models so most comparisons can be generalized to all multizone models. Few of the empirical verifications reported statistical analyses of the comparison between measurements and predictions. Where sufficient data were available in the literature, additional statistical analyses have been performed and reported. Also, most published reportsdid not address the issue of measurement uncertainty. No single reported multizone IAQ model validation effort can be considered to be complete due to limitations in scope, inadequate detail describing experimental and/or modeling procedures, lack of rigorous statistical analysis, inclusion of only small ranges of airflows and concentrations, questions on independence of validation datasets, and other shortcomings. However, if one considers the body of published validation work, it may be concluded that a knowledgeable user can expect to make reasonable predictions of air change rates, interzonal flows, and contaminant concentrations for residential-scale buildings dominated by stack-driven or ventilation flows with inert pollutants. In contrast, more work is clearly needed for applications with high wind speeds, reactive contaminants, or specialized situations such as ambient pollutant entry, small time scales, and non-trace contaminants. Additionally, future model validation efforts will be more useful if more statistical analyses are performed and if more detail on both the measurements and modeling are reported.","#AUTHOR_TAG][23] The modelling, described in detail elsewhere, 16 24 25 used representative archetype dwelling forms (informed by sampling from the EHS 26 27 ) to represent the English dwelling stock.","['We developed a model that characterised the indoor environmental conditions of the 2010 English Housing Survey (EHS). 20', '#AUTHOR_TAG][23] The modelling, described in detail elsewhere, 16 24 25 used representative archetype dwelling forms (informed by sampling from the EHS 26 27 ) to represent the English dwelling stock.', 'Each of these archetypes was modelled under different levels of air tightness and ventilation systems: window opening only, window trickle vents, extract fans, and combined use of trickle vents and extract fans.', 'A total of 896 archetypes were modelled and matched to the EHS on the basis of dwelling type (eg, detached, semidetached, terraces and flats), floor area and notional permeability.', 'The result was a model of indoor environmental conditions for a representative sample of English dwellings (see online supplementary appendix 1 for further details).']",5,"['We developed a model that characterised the indoor environmental conditions of the 2010 English Housing Survey (EHS). 20', '#AUTHOR_TAG][23] The modelling, described in detail elsewhere, 16 24 25 used representative archetype dwelling forms (informed by sampling from the EHS 26 27 ) to represent the English dwelling stock.']"

Is health status of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) associated with maintaining this level of warmth in their homes? METHODS: In a cross-sectional observational study of patients, living in their own homes, living room (LR) and bedroom (BR) temperatures were measured at 30 min intervals over 1 week using electronic dataloggers. Health status was measured with the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and EuroQol: EQ VAS. Outdoor temperatures were provided by Met Office. RESULTS: One hundred and forty eight patients consented to temperature monitoring. Patients' mean age was 69 (SD 8.5) years, 67 (45%) male, mean percentage of predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV(1)) 41.7 (SD 17.4). Fifty-eight (39%) were current smokers. Independent of age, lung function, smoking and outdoor temperatures, poorer respiratory health status was significantly associated (P = 0.01) with fewer days with 9 h of warmth at 21 degrees C in the LR.

We model the effect in 2030 of policies that aim to reduce total carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions by 50% by 2050 globally compared with the effect of emissions in 1990. We use three models: the POLES model, which identifies the distribution of production modes that give the desired CO(2) reductions and associated costs; the GAINS model, which estimates fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter 2.5 microm or less (PM(2.5)) concentrations; and a model to estimate the effect of PM(2.5) on mortality on the basis of the WHO's Comparative Risk Assessment methods. Changes in modes of production of electricity to reduce CO(2) emissions would, in all regions, reduce PM(2.5) and deaths caused by it, with the greatest effect in India and the smallest in the EU. Health benefits greatly offset costs of greenhouse-gas mitigation, especially in India where pollution is high and costs of mitigation are low. Our estimates are approximations but suggest clear health gains (co-benefits) through decarbonising electricity production, and provide additional information about the extent of such gains.","The experiment did not alter outdoor pollutant concentrations related to proposed energy supply decarbonisation, 1 which may reduce outdoor levels of particulate matter in the future. #AUTHOR_TAG","['The modelling results are presented as QALYs; however, it is clear that these changes in disease  outcomes would have an impact on health and social care services beyond these utility estimates.', 'As the average age of the UK population increases so too does the demand on health services.', 'Preventative actions, such as improving energy and ventilation performance, may help to mitigate some of this demand.', 'The exposure modelling in this experiment concentrated on indoor conditions.', 'The experiment did not alter outdoor pollutant concentrations related to proposed energy supply decarbonisation, 1 which may reduce outdoor levels of particulate matter in the future. #AUTHOR_TAG', ""This would further tip the balance towards installing mitigating ventilation systems so as to dilute 'stale' indoor air."", ""Refining the model to include assumptions on energy systems and transport could further improve the estimates of the potential health impact associated with UK's GHG abatement measures.""]",0,"['The experiment did not alter outdoor pollutant concentrations related to proposed energy supply decarbonisation, 1 which may reduce outdoor levels of particulate matter in the future. #AUTHOR_TAG']"

A survey of dwellings in the Warm Front home energy efficiency scheme was carried out in five urban areas of England. Half-hourly living room and main bedroom temperatures were recorded for 2-4 weeks over two winters. For each dwelling, regression of indoor on outdoor temperature was used to obtain estimates of daytime living room and night time bedroom temperatures under standardized conditions (outdoor temperature of 5 degrees C. The results indicate that the median standardized daytime living room temperature was 19.1 degrees C and the median standardized night time bedroom temperature 17.1 degrees C. Temperatures were influenced by property characteristics, including its age, construction and thermal efficiency and also by the household number of people and the age of the head of household. Dwellings that received both heating and insulation measures through the Warm Front scheme had daytime living room temperatures 1.6 degrees C higher than pre-intervention dwellings, night time bedroom temperatures were 2.8 degrees C higher.

Berger-Sabbatel"", ""A. Duda""]","The performance of the IEEE 802.11b wireless local area networks is analyzed. We have observed that when some mobile hosts use a lower bit rate than the others, the performance of all hosts is considerably degraded. Such a situation is a common case in wireless local area networks in which a host far away from an access point is subject to important signal fading and interference. To cope with this problem, the host changes its modulation type, which degrades its bit rate to some lower value. Typically, 802.11b products degrade the bit rate from 11 Mb/s to 5.5, 2, or 1 Mb/s when repeated unsuccessful frame transmissions are detected. In such a case, a host transmitting for example at 1 Mb/s reduces the throughput of all other hosts transmitting at 11 Mb/s to a low value below 1 Mb/s. The basic CSMA/CA channel access method is at the root of this anomaly: it guarantees an equal long term channel access probability to all hosts.

Together, they ruled big business. They transformed popular culture. And they provoked a national controversy. More than anything, they lived a unique and rollicking American Dream, escaping the broken homes of their youth to co-create the most notoriously successful game franchises in historyÑDoom and QuakeÑuntil the games they made tore them apart. Americans spend more money on video games than on movie tickets. Masters of Doom is the first book to chronicle this industryÕs greatest story, written by one of the mediumÕs leading observers. David Kushner takes readers inside the rags-to-riches adventure of two rebellious entrepreneurs who came of age to shape a generation. The vivid portrait reveals why their games are so violent and why their immersion in their brilliantly designed fantasy worlds offered them solace. And it shows how they channeled their fury and imagination into products that are a formative influence on our culture, from MTV to the Internet to Columbine. This is a story of friendship and betrayal, commerce and artistryÑa powerful and compassionate account of what itÕs like to be young, driven, and wildly creative.

This being the case, we should look more closely at how networks are constituted and how they currently function. This paper gives perspectives on how to conduct case research for understanding contemporary business networks. Four imminent challenges of case research that aims at theory development are discussed: the problem of network boundaries, network complexity, the role of time and case comparisons. Potential tools and ideas for solving these problems are put forward. A multicountry research project on business networks is used as an illustrative example.

Insights from cognitive sciences, social psychology, organisational behaviour and strategic management are combined with business marketing literature to gain a better understanding of the concept of Ônetwork picturesÕ. Network pictures are conceptionalised on the basis of the notion of cognitive maps, and it is argued that managersÕ views of business networks and their networking activities are likely to be influenced by the social dynamics of cognition and sense-making. Aspects of the subjectivity and the organisational enactment cycles of network pictures are discussed. Furthermore, it is posited that similarities between network pictures within an organisation are influenced by task, function and hierarchy level. A companyÕs network position, the geographical boundedness and the norms and practices of a network are also likely to influence network pictures. It is further hypothesized that complexity of network pictures is subject to managersÕ hierarchy level, functional orientation and business education, and influences networking pro-activity. Propositions are derived, and ways are outlined, concerning how future (empirical) research can benefit from the present study.

We use the concepts of Ônetwork picturesÕ and ÔnetworkingÕ to illustrate and analyse changes in managerial sense-making and networking activities following a merger or acquisition. The paper focuses on acquiring, acquired or merging parties and those companies with which they have direct customer relationships. Based on three case studies comprising seven acquisitions and one merger, we show that following a merger or acquisition managers may need to adapt their previous network pictures in a radical way; these adaptations are, however, not always realized as shifts in network pictures and adjustments in networking activities by all the managers involved. Whereas the merging parties' network pictures and networking activities are largely driven by their perception of customers' needs and developments, it is not certain that the merger or acquisition is enacted accordingly. The paper contributes to a clearer view on the conceptual interdependence of the constructs of network pictures and networking in multi-actor situations and thus it develops a network perspective on mergers and acquisitions.","Senior personnel changes in organisations; shifts in organisational structures; changes in strategy; as well as acquisitions, mergers and bankruptcies can all cause such change (Halinen et al., 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG, Henneberg, & Mouzas, 2007).","['Change may be seen as an evolutionary process, where revolution is possible but unusual (Easton, 1992), similar to a continuous process where stable periods are broken by radical changes (Halinen et al., 1999).', 'Radical change here means that actor bonds, resource ties and activities are fundamentally altered or dissolved and new relationships established.', 'Halinen et al.

Reger"", ""Timothy B. Palmer""]","The authors empirically examine differences between automatic and controlled processing by executives in an increasingly dynamic industry. The results suggest that cognitive inertia affects judgments in both modes, but the effect is stronger with automatic processing. Specifically, the authors conducted two studies examining executives' cognitive maps of competitive positioning. First, they explored differences in ways strategists categorize competitors in a cross-sectional field study conducted during a period of significant environmental upheaval. They found that managers relied on cognitive maps that reflected obsolete industry boundaries rather than configurations representative of the deregulated marketplace. Hence, managers must be mindful to incorporate new information proactively from many sources and to actively discard old, automatic maps in order to develop reliable maps for changing environments. In a second study, managerial competitive schemas of competitive positioning were compared longitudinally across three research projects conducted in the financial intermediary industry. An eight-year time frame provided a unique opportunity to explore the content of mental models in an industry undergoing an accelerating rate of change. The longitudinal results indicate that change creates diversity of thought across managers in the same environment. Managers at competing firms are therefore apt to view competition quite differently in turbulent environments. Implications of the study findings for strategic decision making, consensus and conflict, and organizational learning and executive succession in turbulent environments are discussed. Issues are identified that warrant further research.","For example, strategic research has looked at strategic groups, either as defined by objective characteristics (McNamara, Deephouse, & Luce, 2003;Porter, 1985) or delineated by a shared understanding of different companies (Osborne, Stubbart, & Ramaprasad, 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG & Palmer, 1996).","['Recent research has stressed the importance of network structures in understanding business exchanges (Achrol, 1997;M�_ller & Rajala, 2007).', 'These complex networks have been researched using different approaches.', 'For example, strategic research has looked at strategic groups, either as defined by objective characteristics (McNamara, Deephouse, & Luce, 2003;Porter, 1985) or delineated by a shared understanding of different companies (Osborne, Stubbart, & Ramaprasad, 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG & Palmer, 1996).', 'While this research tradition looks at structures of competition between related companies, the channel management or supply chain literature treats each individual business relationship as a separate entity, arguing that companies have to respond appropriately to changes in their business environment (Achrol, Reve, & Stern, 1983;Guiltinan, 1974;Stern & Reve, 1980).', 'Business networks have also been characterised in strategic marketing as value-creating systems (Parolini, 1999) where companies co-operate in order to develop value for customers and simultaneously compete to appropriate value (M�_ller & Svahn, 2006;Normann & Ramirez, 1993), and marketing alliances where firms cooperate based on formalised and collaborative agreements (Das, Sen, & Sengupta, 1998;Gulati, Nohria, & Zaheer, 2000).']",1,"['For example, strategic research has looked at strategic groups, either as defined by objective characteristics (McNamara, Deephouse, & Luce, 2003;Porter, 1985) or delineated by a shared understanding of different companies (Osborne, Stubbart, & Ramaprasad, 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG & Palmer, 1996).']"

Johnston"", ""Edward E. Rigdon""]","To date, industrial marketing has built its conceptual frameworks upon the concept of a dyadÑa relationship between one buyer and one seller. Thus, much of what has been researched in business-to-business marketing uses the buyerÐseller relationship as the most appropriate unit of analysis. Yet, today, the most exciting development in business marketing is electronic commerce, which is a technology and a paradigm not of dyads but of networks. A great deal of the buyerÐseller relationship between firms is being replaced or significantly transformed by electronic commerce systems. Networks pose a tremendous problem in measurement. Existing business metrics were designed for a world of concrete boundaries and fixed categoriesÑa world that is slipping away day by day. Governments will have a keen interest in the development of metrics, as they struggle with regulation of these new entities. As boundaries between organizations blur, governments will have more trouble defining the entity that they are attempting to regulate. In the information economy, perhaps governments will recognize the essential role of Òco-opetitionÓ as an essential business strategy. For the dyad, we have the metaphor of marriage. For bureaucratic organizations, we have the metaphor of an army. What is the ÒsimilarÓ organization that will deliver insights about managing within a network? Perhaps the closest metaphor may be a migrating flock of birds.

Deephouse"", ""Rebecca A. Luce""]","Drawing from economic and cognitive theories, researchers have argued that firms within an industry tend to cluster together, following similar strategies. Their positioning in strategic groups, in turn, is argued to influence firm actions and firm performance. We extend this research to examine performance implications of competitive positioning not just among but also within groups. We find that performance differences within groups are significantly larger than across groups, suggesting that some firms within groups develop better resource or competitive positions. We also find that secondary firms within a group outperform both core firms within the group and solitary firms, the latter being those not belonging to any multifirm strategic group. This suggests that secondary firms may be able to effectively balance the benefits of strategic distinctiveness with institutional pressures for similarity. We conclude that the primary implication of strategic groups does not relate to the ability of firms to create stable, advantageous market segments through collusion. Instead, strategic groups represent a range of viable strategic positions firms may stake out and use as reference points. Moreover, our results concerning secondary firms indicate that firm positioning within a group structure can have performance implications.

This exploratory paper aims to investigate the application of network pictures at the dyadic relationship level. Taking the perspective of employees from a single company, this research examines the perceptions of a specific supplier relationship. The study takes the network pictures of three key individuals and examines the boundaries of their network pictures, their lines of communication, their perceived relationship atmosphere and the impact of environmental factors. Unsurprisingly, the boundaries of each network picture, the frequency of communication and perceptions of the relationship atmosphere varied systematically with their managerial level and function. In this regard, the findings suggest that network pictures may act as a useful sense-making tool for developing and sharing relationship information both internally, between employees and externally, with the supplier. Further research is required in order to confirm whether these findings are applicable to other dyadic relationships and to investigate the implications of network pictures as a tool for managers.","Recent research shows increasing interest in the concept of network pictures (Henneberg, Mouzas, & Naudթ, 2009;Henneberg, Naudթ, & Mouzas, 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG & Mason, 2010;Tonge, 2010).","['Following this discussion of an integrated framework which will be used to conceptually underpin our empirical study, the concept of network pictures is introduced as a way of capturing the perceptions of actors regarding the time-, space-, and ascription-specific aspect of change.', 'Network pictures are well suited to this purpose as they represent the subjective sensemaking of managers, due to the fact that ""a concrete market is the result of operations of disentanglement, framing, internalization and externalization"" (Callon, 1999, p. 192), many of which have no \'objective\' properties but are dependent on participants\' beliefs and interpretations (Henneberg et al., 2006).', ""As such, network pictures share some characteristics of concepts developed in the strategy literature on companies' shared understanding of market phenomena, i.e. 'cognitive strategic groups' (Fiegenbaum & Thomas, 1993;Osborne et al., 2001)."", 'Recent research shows increasing interest in the concept of network pictures (Henneberg, Mouzas, & Naudթ, 2009;Henneberg, Naudթ, & Mouzas, 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG & Mason, 2010;Tonge, 2010).', 'They provide understanding of how managers react to changing environments (Halinen & T�_rnroos, 1998;Oberg et al., 2007) and help to explain strategic decision-making behaviour (Borders et al., 2001).', 'As such, the concept of network pictures is influenced by, and related to, the research themes of cognitive strategic groups (Osborne et al., 2001;Porac, Thomas, & Baden-Fuller, 1989) cognitive scripts and cognitive mapping (Fiol & Huff, 1992;Johnson, Daniels, & Asch, 1998), and managerial cognition/sensemaking in organisations (Colville & Pye, 2010;Daft & Weick, 1984;Weick, 1995).']",0,"['Recent research shows increasing interest in the concept of network pictures (Henneberg, Mouzas, & Naudթ, 2009;Henneberg, Naudթ, & Mouzas, 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG & Mason, 2010;Tonge, 2010).']"

Abrahamsen""]","The study here examines how business actors adapt to changes in networks by analyzing their perceptions or their network pictures. The study is exploratory or iterative in the sense that revisions occur to the research question, method, theory, and context as an integral part of the research process.    Changes within networks receive less research attention, although considerable research exists on explaining business network structures in different research traditions. This study analyzes changes in networks in terms of the industrial network approach. This approach sees networks as connected relationships between actors, where interdependent companies interact based on their sensemaking of their relevant network environment. The study develops a concept of network change as well as an operationalization for comparing perceptions of change, where the study introduces a template model of dottograms to systematically analyze differences in perceptions. The study then applies the model to analyze findings from a case study of Norwegian/Japanese seafood distribution, and the chapter provides a rich description of a complex system facing considerable pressure to change. In-depth personal interviews and cognitive mapping techniques are the main research tools applied, in addition to tracer studies and personal observation.    The dottogram method represents a valuable contribution to case study research as it enables systematic within-case and across-case analyses. A further theoretical contribution of the study is the suggestion that network change is about actors seeking to change their network position to gain access to resources. Thereby, the study also implies a close relationship between the concepts network position and the network change that has not been discussed within the network approach in great detail.    Another major contribution of the study is the analysis of the role that network pictures play in actors' efforts to change their network position. The study develops seven propositions in an attempt to describe the role of network pictures in network change. So far, the relevant literature discusses network pictures mainly as a theoretical concept. Finally, the chapter concludes with important implications for management practice.","An initial study of five exporters and seven importers was undertaken in 2006 (Appendix A lists the companies involved) as part of a larger study (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2011).","['In order to demonstrate the dottogram methodology, we show its application to a network facing great change.', 'This is the salmon distribution network from Norwegian farmers and exporters to Japanese distributors and retailers.', 'An initial study of five exporters and seven importers was undertaken in 2006 (Appendix A lists the companies involved) as part of a larger study (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2011).', 'The Norwegian sample was identified by cross-checking information from preliminary discussions with key actors in the seafood industry coupled with official Norwegian export statistics.', 'Subsequent data analysis indicates that 69% of salmon exports to Japan were covered by the respondents.', 'The Japanese sample was identified by the Norwegian suppliers, with a focus on seven companies out of approximately twenty key actors.']",2,"['In order to demonstrate the dottogram methodology, we show its application to a network facing great change.', 'This is the salmon distribution network from Norwegian farmers and exporters to Japanese distributors and retailers.', 'An initial study of five exporters and seven importers was undertaken in 2006 (Appendix A lists the companies involved) as part of a larger study (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2011).', 'The Norwegian sample was identified by cross-checking information from preliminary discussions with key actors in the seafood industry coupled with official Norwegian export statistics.']"

Rafael Ramirez (from the Preface) The Value Net A Tool for Competitive Strategy Cinzia Parolini SDA Bocconi, School of Management, Milan, Italy Faced with a continuously changing, and an increasingly competitive, business environment, strategic analysts and senior managers are still reluctant to forsake the familiar and traditional tools and models which were conceived in the very different world of the 1970s and 1980s. However, these methods of analysis are less and less applicable to the blurred and shifting boundaries of today's business world. This book challenges the tools and models that we use when looking at how value is created, shaped and maintained and presents a new and completely viable methodology - the value net. This methodology provides the reader with a new way of dealing with value in the modern environment. Above all it can be used for the analysis of competitive systems that cannot adequately be analysed using established models. Supported by an impressive array of case studies from industries with which most people will be readily familiar - books, online trading, music, coffee etc. - the book argues that in order to remain competitive, strategists, planners and managers should not use yesterday's tools for today's decisions. This well-structured and highly readable book will help create a brand new perspective in strategic analysis and formulation and will interest managers, strategy consultants, MBA and Executive students in these areas.

Researchers frequently highlight that whatever the researched phenomena, it is important to consider actors' subjective views of the world. The concept of Network Pictures as introduced in the IMP (Industrial Marketing and Purchasing) body of literature by Ford et al. (2002b), refers to those subjective views and despite its recognised importance no in-depth research had been conducted so far on the concept which has thus remained blurred. Ford et al. (2002b) brought in this concept to emphasise that the network is in fact a varying thing depending on what people see. The question is whether this can be translated into a research device, so that researchers may see in a structured and analytical way what an actor's picture is. This is what this research project is about. The concept's theoretical foundations are uncovered by reviewing some principles from Sense-Making Theory. This review results most importantly in the identification of a close association between actors' views of the world and the outcome of those actors' sense making processes or frameworks. The relevance of actors' views to obtain a clearer understanding of organisational networks is highlighted when the relation that is believed to exist between those views and action in organisational networks is addressed. With the aim of developing Network Pictures as research tool a two-stage method is put forward and carried out. The method consisted of operationalising the construct of Network Pictures and then testing it in two different network contexts to see if it was usable and useful for carrying out research in organisational networks. The results point to the usability and usefulness of the developed device: not only does it allow for capturing what is believed to be individuals' views of the world in a rich and comprehensive way, as it also shows diversity between individuals in different contexts. Also and interestingly, some of the identified 'practitioner theories' were found to be not coherent with some IMP theoretical cornerstones.EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo","Conversely, Ford et al.

The focus of the study is public relations practitioners operating in seven consultancies across the UK, in Manchester, London, Yorkshire and Cheshire. Using qualitative methodologies including in-depth interviews and network mapping, the study reveals practitioners' network size and variety of contacts, and their role in client acquisition and retention. In particular, the study suggests that position and gender are two key influences on practitioners' personal networks. The study appears to identify that managers may have the smallest networks compared to their colleagues and especially lack weak tie contacts in the form of friends, and that female practitioners may have larger and more varied personal contact networks than men. The study thus offers an insight into personal network membership for public relations practitioners, hitherto unexplored, plus a deeper understanding of interactional dimensions of social networks and the gendered nature of networking in the UK public relations sector.","Recent research shows increasing interest in the concept of network pictures (Henneberg, Mouzas, & Naudթ, 2009;Henneberg, Naudթ, & Mouzas, 2010;Leek & Mason, 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2010).","['Following this discussion of an integrated framework which will be used to conceptually underpin our empirical study, the concept of network pictures is introduced as a way of capturing the perceptions of actors regarding the time-, space-, and ascription-specific aspect of change.', 'Network pictures are well suited to this purpose as they represent the subjective sensemaking of managers, due to the fact that ""a concrete market is the result of operations of disentanglement, framing, internalization and externalization"" (Callon, 1999, p. 192), many of which have no \'objective\' properties but are dependent on participants\' beliefs and interpretations (Henneberg et al., 2006).', ""As such, network pictures share some characteristics of concepts developed in the strategy literature on companies' shared understanding of market phenomena, i.e. 'cognitive strategic groups' (Fiegenbaum & Thomas, 1993;Osborne et al., 2001)."", 'Recent research shows increasing interest in the concept of network pictures (Henneberg, Mouzas, & Naudթ, 2009;Henneberg, Naudթ, & Mouzas, 2010;Leek & Mason, 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2010).', 'They provide understanding of how managers react to changing environments (Halinen & T�_rnroos, 1998;Oberg et al., 2007) and help to explain strategic decision-making behaviour (Borders et al., 2001).', 'As such, the concept of network pictures is influenced by, and related to, the research themes of cognitive strategic groups (Osborne et al., 2001;Porac, Thomas, & Baden-Fuller, 1989) cognitive scripts and cognitive mapping (Fiol & Huff, 1992;Johnson, Daniels, & Asch, 1998), and managerial cognition/sensemaking in organisations (Colville & Pye, 2010;Daft & Weick, 1984;Weick, 1995).']",0,"['Recent research shows increasing interest in the concept of network pictures (Henneberg, Mouzas, & Naudթ, 2009;Henneberg, Naudթ, & Mouzas, 2010;Leek & Mason, 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2010).', 'They provide understanding of how managers react to changing environments (Halinen & T_rnroos, 1998;Oberg et al., 2007) and help to explain strategic decision-making behaviour (Borders et al., 2001).', 'As such, the concept of network pictures is influenced by, and related to, the research themes of cognitive strategic groups (Osborne et al., 2001;Porac, Thomas, & Baden-Fuller, 1989) cognitive scripts and cognitive mapping (Fiol & Huff, 1992;Johnson, Daniels, & Asch, 1998), and managerial cognition/sensemaking in organisations (Colville & Pye, 2010;Daft & Weick, 1984;Weick, 1995).']"

In this study, service design tools were combined with a qualitative research method, and observation and individual interviews of participants were conducted to record their perceptions of the tax service process.

The change management literature addresses such initiative, but with its single-firm perspective it overlooks the interdependence of network actors.

Our analysis suggests that change efforts unfold as a negotiated process during which the change project is re-negotiated to fit the multiple actor constituencies.

Traditional markets are being replaced by networks. This poses major challenges for industrial companies. Management has to look beyond ordinary customer and supplier relationships into intricate webs of firms. This article focuses on the interaction between a complex business relationship and its immediate business network that we call a focal net. We contend that focal nets have several crucial roles in the emerging industrial network theory. They mediate the impact of the larger industrial networks into dyadic business relations; and vice versa, the influence of a dyad on a network is mediated by the focal net. Theoretical and managerial relevance of focal nets is demonstrated through a 30-year case study of three international corporations.","Therefore, the location of change needs to be analysed, depending on whether it occurs at the actor, dyad, or network level (#AUTHOR_TAG, M�_ller, & Rosenbr�_ijer, 1999;Halinen et al., 1999).","['Any such analysis should be based on the three aspects of time, space, and ascription (Ford et al., 2003;see M�_ller (2010) for alternative models).', ""The time dimension ('when') relates to the subjective understanding of past, present, and future changes (Halinen & T�_rnroos, 2005), i.e. the nature of, reasons for, and impact of changes at different time periods."", ""For the space dimension ('where') it is important to be able to systematically analyse these changes in order to compare differences between actors."", 'Therefore, the location of change needs to be analysed, depending on whether it occurs at the actor, dyad, or network level (#AUTHOR_TAG, M�_ller, & Rosenbr�_ijer, 1999;Halinen et al., 1999).', 'Finally, the perceived cause-and-effect, the ascription dimension of change, needs to be understood.', ""A systematic way to analyse and compare actors' perceptions of network changes along these three dimensions is called for."", 'This article proposes a method based on an analytical framework which enables a more detailed conceptualisation of the dimensions of time (past, present and future changes), space (change at actor, dyad or network level) and cause-and-effect (why changes are occurring).', 'In order to operationalize the analytical framework, the concept of network pictures is introduced as a conceptual tool.', ""We subsequently develop a method ('dottograms') which uses the conceptual framework, together with network pictures as input and facilitates the explanation of change in networks."", 'We exemplify our methodology based on a case study of the Norwegian/Japanese seafood distribution system.']",2,"['Therefore, the location of change needs to be analysed, depending on whether it occurs at the actor, dyad, or network level (#AUTHOR_TAG, M�_ller, & Rosenbr�_ijer, 1999;Halinen et al., 1999).']"

This paper is based on the idea that insights into the dynamics and evolution of networks and companies may be found by taking a longer term perspective. It uses historical documents and correspondence to examine the evolution of a network and of a single company within it over a period of close to a century. The paper highlights the fact that networks and networking are not modern inventions, but are intrinsic to the nature of business activity. The case study also provides illustration of a number of network phenomena, such as network position, networking and the paradoxes that are endemic in networks.

The strategic information transmission taking place in the communication stage is characterized by a strategic communication network. We provide a direct link between players' preferences and the strategic communication network emerging at equilibrium, depending on the strength of the coordination motive and the prior information structure. Equilibrium strategic communication networks are characterized in a very tractable way and compared in term of efficiency. In general, a maximal strategic communication network may not exist and communication networks cannot be ordered in the sense of Pareto.

This could be attributed to a rather myopic view of the multiple complexities and indirect links inherent in networks of business exchange relationships. The task for companies developing innovative segmentation approaches is to simultaneously enhance the company's understanding of downstream as well as upstream preferences and resources, while going beyond immediate interaction partners to include relevant indirect business partners. The challenge is therefore not to identify attractive customer segments, but attractive network segments. As such, the managerial challenge becomes one of creating a business network segmentation from the perspective of a focal company within this network, taking a far wider interpretation of the concept of segmentation. Using the concept of network pictures, we outline the different dimensions that are important within a business network segmentation, and exemplify their use through a case study of an entrepreneurial company. Our study contributes to the literature by providing a detailed example of a practical application of abstract concepts, in this case the translation of the network picture concept into a way to apply a business network segmentation to an entrepreneurial context.","Recent research shows increasing interest in the concept of network pictures (#AUTHOR_TAG, Mouzas, & Naudթ, 2009;Henneberg, Naudթ, & Mouzas, 2010;Leek & Mason, 2010;Tonge, 2010).","['Following this discussion of an integrated framework which will be used to conceptually underpin our empirical study, the concept of network pictures is introduced as a way of capturing the perceptions of actors regarding the time-, space-, and ascription-specific aspect of change.', 'Network pictures are well suited to this purpose as they represent the subjective sensemaking of managers, due to the fact that ""a concrete market is the result of operations of disentanglement, framing, internalization and externalization"" (Callon, 1999, p. 192), many of which have no \'objective\' properties but are dependent on participants\' beliefs and interpretations (Henneberg et al., 2006).', ""As such, network pictures share some characteristics of concepts developed in the strategy literature on companies' shared understanding of market phenomena, i.e. 'cognitive strategic groups' (Fiegenbaum & Thomas, 1993;Osborne et al., 2001)."", 'Recent research shows increasing interest in the concept of network pictures (#AUTHOR_TAG, Mouzas, & Naudթ, 2009;Henneberg, Naudթ, & Mouzas, 2010;Leek & Mason, 2010;Tonge, 2010).', 'They provide understanding of how managers react to changing environments (Halinen & T�_rnroos, 1998;Oberg et al., 2007) and help to explain strategic decision-making behaviour (Borders et al., 2001).', 'As such, the concept of network pictures is influenced by, and related to, the research themes of cognitive strategic groups (Osborne et al., 2001;Porac, Thomas, & Baden-Fuller, 1989) cognitive scripts and cognitive mapping (Fiol & Huff, 1992;Johnson, Daniels, & Asch, 1998), and managerial cognition/sensemaking in organisations (Colville & Pye, 2010;Daft & Weick, 1984;Weick, 1995).']",4,"['Recent research shows increasing interest in the concept of network pictures (#AUTHOR_TAG, Mouzas, & Naudթ, 2009;Henneberg, Naudթ, & Mouzas, 2010;Leek & Mason, 2010;Tonge, 2010).']"

Lucas""]","Employment laws in India and Zimbabwe require employers to obtain permission from the government to retrench or lay off workers. The effect of these laws on the demand for employees in 64 manufacturing industries is examined using time series data. Little evidence is found indicating slower adjustments in employment levels and hence retardation in any structural adjustment following the new laws. However, in both countries a substantial decline in the demand for employees (other things equal) followed the new legislation. In Zimbabwe it is difficult to be precise about a causal connection between the drop in the demand for labor (allowing for concurrent increased wages) and the new legislation because enactment occurred simultaneously with Independence; however, the current economic climate induced high levels of investment in capital but not investments in long-term commitments to employees. But in India further evidence supports a causal connection: larger establishments covered by the job security regulations tended to experience a decline in the demand for labor while smaller, uncovered enterprises in the same industries did not; moreover the decline in demand for employees across industries in India was larger where the private sector predominates, where larger establishments covered by the new laws are important, and where a smaller proportion of employees are union members. Thus in both countries the policy implemented to protect jobs may bave resulted infarfewerjobs. Upon achieving independence in 1980, the government of Zimbabwe passed a new Employment Act, requiring employers to obtain permission from the Ministry of Labor to fire or lay off workers. Comparable regulations were imposed in India by the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act of 1976, requiring that written permission be obtained, normally from the relevant state government, either to close a plant or to retrench workers. The immediate goal of these items of legislation was to protect the livelihood of workers and to maintain jobs. Any addition to economic security in the lives of workers is clearly a laudable goal in its own right. But the question addressed in this article is whether these particular job security regulations have had undesirable side effects, which may even have thwarted the original goals of the legislation.

Thirty individuals with a diagnosis of autism or Asperger syndrome living within the London area took part in the scheme. The control group comprised 20 individuals of similar intellectual and linguistic ability,and previous employment history, living in metropolitan areas out-side London. Over the course of the project significantly more of the supported group than the controls found work; job levels were higher; they were in work for a greater percentage of the time; and they received significantly higher wages. Thirteen different employers (mostly multinational companies) were involved during the course of the project and several were willing to take more than one employee because of their positive experience of employing someone with autism. Although existing resources within the disability employment service hadnot previously been able to provide effective job finding and support services for this group, the current scheme demonstrated that, with specialist input, supported employment can be very effective. Moreover the costs, although initially high, reduced significantly over time. One of the most expensive and time-consuming aspects of the scheme, but one that appeared to be crucial for success, was the need for close liaison with employers in order to explore appropriate job opportunities and to match these carefully to the skills and abilities of individual clients. However, although some elements of the scheme can continue to be supported through government funding, no financial provision is available for this initial and essential stage of job finding. If programmes of this kind are to continue to provide help for individuals with autism, it is crucial that such funding is provided.","For instance, there is evidence for significant effects of 'Prospects' (established by the NAS in 1994), one of the few specialised employment services for individuals with autism in the United Kingdom, on the likelihood of finding paid employment ( #AUTHOR_TAG and Howlin, 1999).","['Research on supported employment programmes for individuals with mental health problems or intellectual disabilities indicates that these schemes are superior to sheltered workshops or other day service options.', 'Advantages include greater financial gains for the employees, wider social integration, increased worker satisfaction, higher self-esteem, more independent living, reduced family burden including a lower need for providing informal care, and service cost-savings (Beyer and Kilsby, 1996;Bond et al., 1997Bond et al., , 2008Crowther et al., 2001;Graetz, 2010;Griffin et al., 1996;Heffernan and Pilkington, 2011;McCaughrin et al., 1993;Noble et al., 1991;Rhodes et al., 1987;Stevens and Martin, 1999).', 'Specialised supported employment schemes also enable individuals with autism to secure and maintain a paid job in a regular work environment.', ""For instance, there is evidence for significant effects of 'Prospects' (established by the NAS in 1994), one of the few specialised employment services for individuals with autism in the United Kingdom, on the likelihood of finding paid employment ( #AUTHOR_TAG and Howlin, 1999)."", 'Moreover, follow-up results are suggestive of longterm beneficial effects with significant job retention 7-8 years after the initiation of the supported employment programme (Howlin et al., 2005).', 'There is also evidence from non-UK studies on adults with autism for a positive impact of supported employment programmes on employment levels and job retention (Hillier et al., 2007;Keel et al., 1997), on autistic behaviours (Garcia-Villamisar et al., 2000), quality of life (Garcia-Villamisar et al., 2002) and executive function (Garcia-Villamisar and Hughes, 2007).']",5,"['Research on supported employment programmes for individuals with mental health problems or intellectual disabilities indicates that these schemes are superior to sheltered workshops or other day service options.', ""For instance, there is evidence for significant effects of 'Prospects' (established by the NAS in 1994), one of the few specialised employment services for individuals with autism in the United Kingdom, on the likelihood of finding paid employment ( #AUTHOR_TAG and Howlin, 1999).""]"

Comparisons paid particular attention to the differences between people entering work and those who remained unemployed. Costs were analysed from a government perspective (excluding earnings) and a societal perspective (excluding welfare benefits and taxes).  Results: People who entered work reduced their consumption of mental health services (p<0.001).  However, use of supported employment increased (p=0.04), in contrast to falling use by people who remained unemployed (p<0.001) and those who had been working for more than one year (p=0.002).

There have been few trials in other parts of the world. Aims: To investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of IPS in the UK. Method: Individuals with severe mental illness in South London were randomised to IPS or local traditional vocational services (treatment as usual) (ISRCTN96677673). Results: Two hundred and nineteen participants were randomised, and 90% assessed 1 year later. There were no significant differences between the treatment as usual and intervention groups in obtaining competitive employment (13% in the intervention group and 7% in controls; risk ratio 1.35, 95% CI 0.95-1.93, P = 0.15), nor in secondary outcomes. Conclusions: There was no evidence that IPS was of significant benefit in achieving competitive employment for individuals in South London at 1-year follow-up, which may reflect suboptimal implementation. Implementation of IPS can be challenging in the UK context where IPS is not structurally integrated with mental health services, and economic disincentives may lead to lower levels of motivation in individuals with severe mental illness and psychiatric professionals.","In the United Kingdom, the cost-effectiveness of supported employment versus standard care (local traditional vocational services) for people with severe mental illness has been evaluated in a randomised controlled trial (RCT;  #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010;follow-up data in Heslin et al., 2011).","['In the United Kingdom, the cost-effectiveness of supported employment versus standard care (local traditional vocational services) for people with severe mental illness has been evaluated in a randomised controlled trial (RCT;  #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010;follow-up data in Heslin et al., 2011).', 'In this trial, supported employment in the form of IPS was provided by an external supported non-governmental employment agency.', 'The analysis considered health and social care costs.', 'Supported employment and standard care were found to result in similar low rates of competitive employment (13% vs 7% at 1-year follow-up, p = 0.15; 22% vs 11% at 2-year follow-up, p = 0.053) and were no different in other secondary outcomes (such as number of hours worked per week, length of job tenure, income, job satisfaction, quality of life and self-esteem).', 'The effect of the intervention on rates of employment was significant at 2 years (p = 0.041) after controlling for all socio-demographic factors and clinical measures at baseline.', 'No significant differences were found in overall, service or medication costs.', 'Based on these findings, it was concluded that supported employment was likely a cost-effective option.', 'The authors attributed the low employment rates of supported employment (which are the lowest rates reported in trials of supported employment so far) to potential difficulties in the implementation of IPS in the UK context, where it is not structurally integrated within mental health teams, as well as to economic disincentives which lead to lower levels of motivation in programme providers, clients and prospective employers.', 'However, the study has been criticised for its bad conduct: Latimer (2010) notes that the study by Howard et al.

Although several reviews on the literature on its effectiveness have been conducted, the completion of several new studies suggests an updated review is warranted. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search for randomized controlled trials of IPS, limiting our review to programs with high-fidelity IPS programs, locating 11 studies. We examined the following competitive employment outcomes: employment rates, days to first job, annualized weeks worked, and job tenure in longest job held during the follow-up period. Findings: Across the 11 studies, the competitive employment rate was 61% for IPS compared to 23% for controls. About two-thirds of those who obtained competitive employment worked 20 hours or more per week. Among those who obtained a competitive job, IPS participants obtained their first job nearly 10 weeks earlier than did controls. Among IPS participants who obtained competitive work, duration of employment after the start of the first job averaged 24.2 weeks per year, or 47% of the 52-week year. Conclusions: The current review is consistent with earlier reviews, although the evidence for high-fidelity IPS appears to be somewhat stronger here than in reviews evaluating studies with more heterogeneity in the supported employment models examined. The number, consistency, and effect sizes of studies of evidence-based supported employment establish it as one of the most robust interventions available for persons with severe mental illness.","Advantages include greater financial gains for the employees, wider social integration, increased worker satisfaction, higher self-esteem, more independent living, reduced family burden including a lower need for providing informal care, and service cost-savings (Beyer and Kilsby, 1996;Bond et al., 1997 #AUTHOR_TAG et al., , 2008Crowther et al., 2001;Graetz, 2010;Griffin et al., 1996;Heffernan and Pilkington, 2011;McCaughrin et al., 1993;Noble et al., 1991;Rhodes et al., 1987;Stevens and Martin, 1999).","['Research on supported employment programmes for individuals with mental health problems or intellectual disabilities indicates that these schemes are superior to sheltered workshops or other day service options.', 'Advantages include greater financial gains for the employees, wider social integration, increased worker satisfaction, higher self-esteem, more independent living, reduced family burden including a lower need for providing informal care, and service cost-savings (Beyer and Kilsby, 1996;Bond et al., 1997 #AUTHOR_TAG et al., , 2008Crowther et al., 2001;Graetz, 2010;Griffin et al., 1996;Heffernan and Pilkington, 2011;McCaughrin et al., 1993;Noble et al., 1991;Rhodes et al., 1987;Stevens and Martin, 1999).', 'Specialised supported employment schemes also enable individuals with autism to secure and maintain a paid job in a regular work environment.', ""For instance, there is evidence for significant effects of 'Prospects' (established by the NAS in 1994), one of the few specialised employment services for individuals with autism in the United Kingdom, on the likelihood of finding paid employment (Mawhood and Howlin, 1999)."", 'Moreover, follow-up results are suggestive of longterm beneficial effects with significant job retention 7-8 years after the initiation of the supported employment programme (Howlin et al., 2005).', 'There is also evidence from non-UK studies on adults with autism for a positive impact of supported employment programmes on employment levels and job retention (Hillier et al., 2007;Keel et al., 1997), on autistic behaviours (Garcia-Villamisar et al., 2000), quality of life (Garcia-Villamisar et al., 2002) and executive function (Garcia-Villamisar and Hughes, 2007).']",0,"['Research on supported employment programmes for individuals with mental health problems or intellectual disabilities indicates that these schemes are superior to sheltered workshops or other day service options.', 'Advantages include greater financial gains for the employees, wider social integration, increased worker satisfaction, higher self-esteem, more independent living, reduced family burden including a lower need for providing informal care, and service cost-savings (Beyer and Kilsby, 1996;Bond et al., 1997 #AUTHOR_TAG et al., , 2008Crowther et al., 2001;Graetz, 2010;Griffin et al., 1996;Heffernan and Pilkington, 2011;McCaughrin et al., 1993;Noble et al., 1991;Rhodes et al., 1987;Stevens and Martin, 1999).', 'Specialised supported employment schemes also enable individuals with autism to secure and maintain a paid job in a regular work environment.', ""For instance, there is evidence for significant effects of 'Prospects' (established by the NAS in 1994), one of the few specialised employment services for individuals with autism in the United Kingdom, on the likelihood of finding paid employment (Mawhood and Howlin, 1999)."", 'Moreover, follow-up results are suggestive of longterm beneficial effects with significant job retention 7-8 years after the initiation of the supported employment programme (Howlin et al., 2005).', 'There is also evidence from non-UK studies on adults with autism for a positive impact of supported employment programmes on employment levels and job retention (Hillier et al., 2007;Keel et al., 1997), on autistic behaviours (Garcia-Villamisar et al., 2000), quality of life (Garcia-Villamisar et al., 2002) and executive function (Garcia-Villamisar and Hughes, 2007).']"

Child and adult variables related to current outcomes were explored.All individuals continued to meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), but severity of autism symptoms declined over time. Nevertheless, only 10 individuals (17%) were rated as having a ""good"" or ""very good"" outcome; the majority (60%) were assessed as having ""poor"" or ""very poor"" outcomes. The strongest predictor of adult outcome was the Reciprocal Social Interaction domain score on the ADI at diagnostic confirmation. Change over time was further examined in a subgroup (n = 44) previously assessed 20 years ago earlier (mean age = 26 years). Although severity of autism had continued to decrease during the adult period, social outcomes were poorer than in younger adulthood.In this cohort of adults first diagnosed with autism, on average, 37 years previously, social inclusion remains very limited, despite general improvements in autism symptomatology with age. Whether these findings will be replicated in future generations of children with autism, who now have the benefits of earlier diagnosis and wider access to specialist provision, needs to be the focus of further longitudinal research.Copyright (c) 2013 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

Individual Placement and Support (IPS) offers a promising approach to establishing people in paid employment. In a randomized controlled trial across six European countries, we investigated the economic case for IPS for people with severe mental health problems compared to standard vocational rehabilitation. Individuals (n=312) were randomized to receive either IPS or standard vocational services and followed for 18 months. Service use and outcome data were collected. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted with two primary outcomes: additional days worked in competitive settings and additional percentage of individuals who worked at least 1 day. Analyses distinguished country effects. A partial cost-benefit analysis was also conducted. IPS produced better outcomes than alternative vocational services at lower cost overall to the health and social care systems. This pattern also held in disaggregated analyses for five of the six European sites. The inclusion of imputed values for missing cost data supported these findings. IPS would be viewed as more cost-effective than standard vocational services. Further analysis demonstrated cost-benefit arguments for IPS.

Decisions must be made on issues such as medical devices, diagnostic technologies, surgical procedures, and pharmaceuticals. Researchers are therefore required to incorporate all appropriate evidence into the analysis, compare all technologies with the alternative options, and to reflect uncertainty in evidence in the conclusions of the analysis. Decision-analytic modelling is commonly used as the framework for meeting these requirements. This is a practical guide to the use of modelling techniques, starting with the basics of constructing different forms of model, the population of the model with input parameter estimates, analysis of the results, and progression to the holistic view of models as a tool to inform future research exercises.

However, despite these advantages, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves have yet to be widely adopted within the field of economic evaluation of health care technologies.

This approach is based on an ongoing longitudinal study of persons with mental retardation who are competitively employed through the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center at Virginia Commonwealth University.

The paradox relates to the use of museums which, whilst widely perceived as rather elitist institutions, appear from a postcode analysis of school visits to museums to be visited by large numbers of schools located in areas of social deprivation. The present analysis further explores this paradox, drawing on revised postcode analysis and governmental indices of multiple deprivation and income deprivation affecting children. The analysis supports the contention that museums attracted visits from schools located in areas with some of the highest levels of deprivation, although it suggests that this result needs to be considered in relation to regional differences in areas of social deprivation, the location of museums and the differences between individual and area-based measures of deprivation. Attention is then drawn to the potential of considering museums through a geographical perspective, and specifically through Foucault's notions of primary, secondary and tertiary spatializations. It is argued that primary spatializations encompasses how museums are conceptualized and classified; secondary spatializations concern how various elements of museums are articulated together; and tertiary spatializations relate to the placement of museums in wider societal contexts and processes. It is suggested that the postcode analysis of school visits points both to the significance of considering tertiary spatializations relating to the social circumstances of museum visitors but also raised questions concerning primary spatializations of museums. Attention is drawn to changes in the classification and grouping of museums, and how these often encompass geographically based criteria related to the social reach of museums. The article ends by considering the degree to which museums might seek to further change their primary spatialization to reflect tertiary spatializations relating to cultural value.","Outside the United States and Canada, however, social exclusion and nonparticipation in ISE has received less research attention.Studies on school trips to museums and science centers have argued that such trips benefit children from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds (#AUTHOR_TAG, Phillips, &amp; Woodham, 2009) and can affect some children over a year after their visit (Bamberger &amp; Tal, 2008)","['Outside the United States and Canada, however, social exclusion and nonparticipation in ISE has received less research attention.Studies on school trips to museums and science centers have argued that such trips benefit children from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds (#AUTHOR_TAG, Phillips, &amp; Woodham, 2009) and can affect some children over a year after their visit (Bamberger &amp; Tal, 2008)']",1,"['Outside the United States and Canada, however, social exclusion and nonparticipation in ISE has received less research attention.Studies on school trips to museums and science centers have argued that such trips benefit children from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds (#AUTHOR_TAG, Phillips, &amp; Woodham, 2009) and can affect some children over a year after their visit (Bamberger &amp; Tal, 2008)']"

In this second edition of this classic text, which includes a new introduction by Pierre Bourdieu, the authors develop an analysis of education (in its broadest sense, encompassing more than the process of formal education). They show how education carries an essentially arbitrary cultural scheme which is actually, though not in appearance, based on power. More widely, the reproduction of culture through education is shown to play a key part in the reproduction of the whole social system. The analysis is carried through not only in theoretical terms but through the development of empirically testable propositions within the wider framework of the historical transformation of the educational system.","For example, a school system where the knowledge that ""counts"" is that of the dominant groups can be understood to disadvantage students from nondominant groups by rendering their knowledges and practices as ""other,"" such that those students eventually decide not to pursue higher education, taking themselves out of the system (#AUTHOR_TAG & Passeron, 1990;Ogbu, 1992;Yosso, 2005;Young, 2000).","[""In this paper, I also draw upon Bourdieu's concept of symbolic violence."", 'For Bourdieu, symbolic violence lay in the misrecognition of overt exclusion, domination, or inherited advantage.', 'He described it as ""gentle, invisible violence, unrecognized as such, chosen as much as undergone"" (Bourdieu, 1990, p. 127).', 'For example, a school system where the knowledge that ""counts"" is that of the dominant groups can be understood to disadvantage students from nondominant groups by rendering their knowledges and practices as ""other,"" such that those students eventually decide not to pursue higher education, taking themselves out of the system (#AUTHOR_TAG & Passeron, 1990;Ogbu, 1992;Yosso, 2005;Young, 2000).', 'That such practices obscure the reproduction of inequality is at the heart of their power (Bourdieu & Passeron, 1990).', 'In this paper, I explore where and how habitus, forms of capital, and symbolic violence might be identified in the attitudes and experiences of participants from marginalized social positions and in ISE practices.']",4,"['For example, a school system where the knowledge that ""counts"" is that of the dominant groups can be understood to disadvantage students from nondominant groups by rendering their knowledges and practices as ""other,"" such that those students eventually decide not to pursue higher education, taking themselves out of the system (#AUTHOR_TAG & Passeron, 1990;Ogbu, 1992;Yosso, 2005;Young, 2000).']"

CRT shifts the research lens away from a deficit view of Communities of Color as places full of cultural poverty disadvantages, and instead focuses on and learns from the array of cultural knowledge, skills, abilities and contacts possessed by socially marginalized groups that often go unrecognized and unacknowledged. Various forms of capital nurtured through cultural wealth include aspirational, navigational, social, linguistic, familial and resistant capital. These forms of capital draw on the knowledges Students of Color bring with them from their homes and communities into the classroom. This CRT approach to education involves a commitment to develop schools that acknowledge the multiple strengths of Communities of Color in order to serve a larger purpose of struggle toward social and racial justice.

During the latter part of the Porfirio Diaz administration (1876-1910), the middle class grew as the city became a commercial and administrative center. Sociologists both criticized and praised the middle class and its role in the country's future. Members of the middle class distinguished themselves from the Porfirian elite and lower classes through bodily behaviors learned from urban conduct manuals and short stories. The Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) was a devastating blow to the middle class, which rallied around issues of housing, employment, and transportation. In the neighborhood of Santa Maria la Ribera, residents petitioned for urban services and infrastructure improvements. Continuing a long history of civic engagement, the city's middle class publicly organized in response to the anti-clerical policies of the Plutarco Calles administration (1924-1928). Economic and political difficulties hindered the efforts of post-revolutionary municipal and federal leaders to win state loyalty from Mexico City's public employees. At the same time, new mass media, fashions, and popular culture of the 1920s and 1930s challenged existing class distinctions and gender norms. Educational opportunities opened up wider prospects for the middle class, or those seeking middle-class status. Technical schools and the National Polytechnic School offered one set of possibilities. The National Preparatory School and the National University offered another. The Lazaro Cardenas administration (1936-1940) aimed to unite the middle class and the working class. As the state bureaucracy grew in the 1930s, Cardenas brought public employees into a close relationship with the National Revolutionary Party (PNR), which later became the Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM). By the end of the Cardenas era, many sectors of the middle class felt politically marginalized.

We look at subversive moments of resistance to challenge this structure,  but more often than not, it would seem, this hierarchical structure of language is the one that prevails.

Democratic theory should include forms of acknowledgement, narrative, rhetoric, and public protest, along with argument, in its account of the normative ideals of political communication. Inclusive democracy involves more than the formal equality of all individuals and groups to enter the political process, but entails taking special measures to compensate for the social and economic inequalities of unjust social structures. Such special measures may require forms of group representation, in order that the particular social perspective of group members gains voice. Residential segregation poses particular problems for inclusive democracy in many societies. Organizing metropolitan governance systems with diverse representation may respond to such problems. In a globalized world, finally, the project of inclusive democracy involves criticizing adherence to nation_state sovereignty and creating global level democratic institutions.","In this paper, I have tried to balance describing, analyzing, and representing people and their specific experiences against the problems inherent in such work, not least contributing to constructions of ""others"" (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2000).","['Inherent in social research on experiences of exclusion is the risk of essentializing those involved and contributing to problematic constructions of ""nonparticipants,"" ""nonvisitors,"" ""the excluded,"" ""other,"" or ""underprivileged groups"" (Cribb & Gewirtz, 2005).', 'The problems and politics of identification and representation are no small matter and, as Young has argued, ""all systems and institutions of representation group individuals according to some kind of principles, and none are innocent or neutral"" (Young, 2000, p. 143).', 'Exploring nonparticipation and representation in terms of who can and cannot access resources and what is at stake in questions of participation is important, but risky.', 'In this paper, I have tried to balance describing, analyzing, and representing people and their specific experiences against the problems inherent in such work, not least contributing to constructions of ""others"" (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2000).', 'This paper provides concrete examples of social exclusion from ISE and suggests that understanding experiences of difference, discomfort, and inaccessibility are crucial for creating more inclusive ISE practices.']",0,"['Inherent in social research on experiences of exclusion is the risk of essentializing those involved and contributing to problematic constructions of ""nonparticipants,"" ""nonvisitors,"" ""the excluded,"" ""other,"" or ""underprivileged groups"" (Cribb & Gewirtz, 2005).', 'The problems and politics of identification and representation are no small matter and, as Young has argued, ""all systems and institutions of representation group individuals according to some kind of principles, and none are innocent or neutral"" (Young, 2000, p. 143).', 'Exploring nonparticipation and representation in terms of who can and cannot access resources and what is at stake in questions of participation is important, but risky.', 'In this paper, I have tried to balance describing, analyzing, and representing people and their specific experiences against the problems inherent in such work, not least contributing to constructions of ""others"" (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2000).', 'This paper provides concrete examples of social exclusion from ISE and suggests that understanding experiences of difference, discomfort, and inaccessibility are crucial for creating more inclusive ISE practices.']"

Multicultural education advocates inadequately design their program to focus on cultural differences in content and form.

We need to know more about why, how, and for whom out-of-school settings make a difference.

Grounded in sociocultural-historical theory, this book explores, youthsÕ meaning making of science and co-constructions of new levels of understandings of science, as well as how they come to position themselves in relation to science through participation in science practices at the margin. The author highlights the multiplicity of learning, becoming and hybridity that constitute the learning of science in the three sites studied. Her analysis suggests that most youth position themselves as science users, as youth who are creating with and learning through science with others in textually rich environments and situations, and in ways that are meaningful to them. Their identity as users of science is grounded in the forms of engagement supported by the three science practices.

The simulation of steep-fronted flows that occur after heavy rainfall flash floods or as inundation from dyke breaches is usually based on the non-linear shallow water equations in hyperbolic conservation form. Particular challenges to numerical modellers are posed by the need to balance correctly the flux gradient and source terms in Godunov-type finite volume shock-capturing schemes and by the moving wetÐdry boundary as the flood rises or falls. This paper presents a Godunov-type shallow flow solver on adaptive quadtree grids aimed at simulating flood flows as they travel over natural terrain. By choosing the stage and discharge as dependent variables in the hyperbolic non-linear shallow water equations, a new deviatoric formulation is derived that mathematically balances the flux gradient and source terms in cases where there are wetÐdry fronts. The new formulation is more general in application than previous a priori approaches. Three benchmark tests are used to validate the solver, and include steady flow over a submerged hump, flow disturbances propagating over an elliptical-shaped hump, and free surface sloshing motions in a vessel with a parabolic bed. The model is also used to simulate the propagation of a flood due to a dam break over an initially dry floodplain containing three humps.",The Etta-SWE approach was further improved and verified for a MUSCL second-order scheme in the work of #AUTHOR_TAG and Borthwick (2009).,"['The incorporation of a topography discretization technique with Godunov-type SWE numerical solvers has been an issue of extreme relevance to their practical development.', 'In respect of this, various discretization approaches have appeared, over the last two decades, which are featured with the ability to maintain a correct discrete balance between topography gradient and the spatial flux.', 'Such a numerical model has been referred to be ""well-balanced"" or to satisfy the ""C-property"" (Berm�_dez and VՍzquez-Cend�_n 1994, Greenberg and LeRoux 1996, LeVeque 1998.', 'Among the popular topography discretization approaches, the sophisticated Upwind approach is the eldest.', 'It was derived by Berm�_dez and VՍzquez-Cend�_n (1994) for a first-order accurate formulation and was then adopted to integrate the topography within higher-order FV-based Godunov-type models (e.g.', 'Garc�_a-Navarro and VՍzquez-Cend�_n 1999, Vulovic and Sopta 2002, Crnjaric-Zic et al. 2004).', 'However, the Upwind approach is renowned for its complexity in implementation and its limitation to a FV approximation (Zhou et al. 2001, Kesserwani et al. 2010.', 'The Surface Gradient Method (SGM) relies on numerical reconstruction to the free-surface elevation and discretises the topography source term using a cell-centred pointwise approach.', 'It was first reported in Nujic (1995) for a first-order Godunov-type model, and formally formulated in Zhou et al.

The main advantages are: (1) a simple centered discretization is used for the source terms; (2) the scheme is no more complicated than the conventional method for the homogeneous terms; (3) small perturbations in the water surface elevation can be accurately predicted; and (4) the method is generally suitable for both steady and unsteady shallow-water problems.

Hyperbolic balance laws have steady state solutions in which the flux gradients are nonzero but are exactly balanced by the source terms. In our earlier work [31-33], we designed high order well-balanced schemes to a class of hyperbolic systems with separable source terms. In this paper, we present a different approach to the same purpose: designing high order well-balanced finite volume weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes and Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) finite element methods. We make the observation that the traditional RKDG methods are capable of maintaining certain steady states exactly, if a small modification on either the initial condition or the flux is provided. The computational cost to obtain such a well balanced RKDG method is basically the same as the traditional RKDG method. The same idea can be applied to the finite volume WENO schemes. We will first describe the algorithms and prove the well balanced property for the shallow water equations, and then show that the result can be generalized to a class of other balance laws. We perform extensive one and two dimensional simulations to verify the properties of these schemes such as the exact preservation of the balance laws for certain steady state solutions, the non-oscillatory property for general solutions with discontinuities, and the genuine hig","The Hydr-Rec approach has been successfully applied-as a topography discretization technique -to various high-order Godunov-type models such as WENO-FV and DG methods (#AUTHOR_TAG andShu 2006, Noelle et al. 2007), and further enhanced -as a wetting and drying condition -with both FV and DG second-order Godunov-type models (Liang 2010, Kesserwani andLiang 2012).","['The incorporation of a topography discretization technique with Godunov-type SWE numerical solvers has been an issue of extreme relevance to their practical development.', 'In respect of this, various discretization approaches have appeared, over the last two decades, which are featured with the ability to maintain a correct discrete balance between topography gradient and the spatial flux.', 'Such a numerical model has been referred to be ""well-balanced"" or to satisfy the ""C-property"" (Berm�_dez and VՍzquez-Cend�_n 1994, Greenberg and LeRoux 1996, LeVeque 1998.', 'Among the popular topography discretization approaches, the sophisticated Upwind approach is the eldest.', 'It was derived by Berm�_dez and VՍzquez-Cend�_n (1994) for a first-order accurate formulation and was then adopted to integrate the topography within higher-order FV-based Godunov-type models (e.g.', 'Garc�_a-Navarro and VՍzquez-Cend�_n 1999, Vulovic and Sopta 2002, Crnjaric-Zic et al. 2004).', 'However, the Upwind approach is renowned for its complexity in implementation and its limitation to a FV approximation (Zhou et al. 2001, Kesserwani et al. 2010.', 'The Surface Gradient Method (SGM) relies on numerical reconstruction to the free-surface elevation and discretises the topography source term using a cell-centred pointwise approach.', 'It was first reported in Nujic (1995) for a first-order Godunov-type model, and formally formulated in Zhou et al.

A second-order sequel to Godunov's method,"[""Bram van Leer""]","A method of second-order accuracy is described for integrating the equations of ideal compressible flow. The method is based on the integral conservation laws and is dissipative, so that it can be used across shocks. The heart of the method is a one-dimensional Lagrangean scheme that may be regarded as a second-order sequel to Godunov's method. The second-order accuracy is achieved by taking the distributions of the state quantities inside a gas slab to be linear, rather than uniform as in Godunov's method. The Lagrangean results are remapped with least-squares accuracy onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Several monotonicity algorithms are applied to ensure positivity, monotonicity and nonlinear stability. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting. Numerical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows are presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the method. The paper concludes with a summary of the results of the whole series ÒTowards the Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme.Ó","To achieve a second-order accurate formulation in a Godunov-type framework, the MUSCL interpolation approach is often employed (#AUTHOR_TAG 1979), which rests on (extrinsic) reconstruction of piecewise-linear solutions from the initial local piecewise-constant data.","['In its simplistic view, a Godunov-type scheme provides a first-order accurate model that is conceptually based (Godunov 1959).', 'It employs the Finite Volume (FV) framework to approximate the integral of the flow variables -relative to the shallow water equations (SWE) cast in a conservative form -as piecewise-constant per local discrete element but with interelemental discontinuities; these discontinuities are combined via the solution of the Riemann problem to provide a sound approximation to the inter-elemental fluxes (Toro 2001).', 'To achieve a second-order accurate formulation in a Godunov-type framework, the MUSCL interpolation approach is often employed (#AUTHOR_TAG 1979), which rests on (extrinsic) reconstruction of piecewise-linear solutions from the initial local piecewise-constant data.']",5,"['In its simplistic view, a Godunov-type scheme provides a first-order accurate model that is conceptually based (Godunov 1959).', 'To achieve a second-order accurate formulation in a Godunov-type framework, the MUSCL interpolation approach is often employed (#AUTHOR_TAG 1979), which rests on (extrinsic) reconstruction of piecewise-linear solutions from the initial local piecewise-constant data.']"

Starting with a general presentation of the governing equations for free-surface shallow flows and a discussion of their physical applicability, the book goes on to analyse the mathematical properties of the equations, in preparation for the presentation of the exact solution of the Riemann problem for wet and dry beds. After a general introduction to the finite volume approach, several chapters are then devoted to describing a variety of modern shock-capturing finite volume numerical methods, including Godunov methods of the upwind and centred type. Approximate Riemann solvers following various approaches are studied in detail as is their use in the Godunov approach for constructing low and high-order upwind TVD methods. Centred TVD schemes are also presented. Two chapters are then devoted to practical applications. The book finishes with an overview of potential practical applications of the methods studied, along with appropriate reference to sources of further information. Features include: * Algorithmic and practical presentation of the methods * Practical applications such as dam-break modelling and the study of bore reflection patterns in two space dimensions * Sample computer programs and accompanying numerical software (details available at www.numeritek.com) The book is suitable for teaching postgraduate students of civil, mechanical, hydraulic and environmental engineering, meteorology, oceanography, fluid mechanics and applied mathematics. Selected portions of the material may also be useful in teaching final year undergraduate students in the above disciplines.

It is a hyperbolic system of conservation laws that approximately describes various geophysical flows, such as rivers, coastal areas, and oceans when completed with a Coriolis term, or granular flows when completed with friction. Numerical approximate solutions to this system may be generated using conservative finite volume methods, which are known to properly handle shocks and contact discontinuities. However, in general these schemes are known to be quite inaccurate for near steady states, as the structure of their numerical truncation errors is generally not compatible with exact physical steady state conditions.

Simplified formulae for initializing bed data at a discrete level are derived by assuming a local linear bed function to ease practical flow simulations.

Many numerical methods (e.g., fractional step methods) have difficulty preserving such steady states and cannot accurately calculate small perturbations of such states. Here a variant of the wave-propagation algorithm is developed which addresses this problem by introducing a Riemann problem in the center of each grid cell whose flux difference exactly cancels the source term. This leads to modified Riemann problems at the cell edges in which the jump now corresponds to perturbations from the steady state. Computing waves and limiters based on the solution to these Riemann problems gives high-resolution results. The 1D and 2D shallow water equations for flow over arbitrary bottom topography are use as an example, though the ideas apply to many other systems.

It is in the interest of practising engineers and developers to be familiar with the specific features of discontinuous wave propagation problems and to be aware of the possibilities offered by Godunov-type schemes for their solution. This book aims to present the principles of such schemes in a way that is easily understandable to practising engineers.The features of hyperbolic conservation laws and their solutions are presented in the first two chapters. The principles of Godunov-type schemes are outlined in a third chapter. Chapters 4 and 5 cover the application of the original Godunov scheme to scalar laws and to hyperbolic systems of conservation laws respectively. Chapter 6 is devoted to higher-order schemes in one dimension of space. The design of such a scheme is described for the general case and applied to some well-known schemes such as the MUSCL and PPM schemes. Chapter 7 focuses on multidimensional problems. The classical alternate directions and finite volume approaches are presented together with the wave splitting technique that is described in depth with an application to two-dimensional systems. Chapter 8 deals with large-time step algorithms. These include front tracking-based methods, explicit-implicit techniques and the time-line interpolation technique. Three appendices provide notions on accuracy and stability issues, Riemann solvers and the user instructions for the computational codes provided in the enclosed CD-ROM.","Godunov-type shallow water models are featured with the inherent ability to accommodate complex flow transitions within the numerical solution (Toro 2001, #AUTHOR_TAG 2003, Toro and Garc�_a-Navarro 2007.","['Godunov-type shallow water models are featured with the inherent ability to accommodate complex flow transitions within the numerical solution (Toro 2001, #AUTHOR_TAG 2003, Toro and Garc�_a-Navarro 2007.', 'In recent years, they have received applied improvements and have been incorporated into water industry standard software (Lhomme et al. 2010), and used to support flood risk management (Nթelz and Pender 2010).', 'In this context, applicable Godunov-type water wave models are at most second-order accurate and require a topography discretization technique and a wetting and drying condition (see Delis and Kampanis 2009 for a comprehensive review).']",0,"['Godunov-type shallow water models are featured with the inherent ability to accommodate complex flow transitions within the numerical solution (Toro 2001, #AUTHOR_TAG 2003, Toro and Garc�_a-Navarro 2007.']"
CC2857,52040210,Governance costs in foreign direct investments: A MNC headquarters challenge,Gabriel Benito,The Economic Institutions of Capitalism Firms Markets,"[""Oliver E. Williamson""]","This study is based on the belief that economic organization is shaped by transaction cost economizing decisions. It sets out the basic principles of transaction cost economics, applies the basic arguments to economic institutions, and develops public policy implications. Any issue that arises, or can be recast as a matter of contracting, is usefully examined in terms of transaction costs. Transaction cost economics maintains that governance of contractual relations is mainly achieved through institutions of private ordering instead of legal centralism. This approach is based on behavioral assumptions of bounded rationalism and opportunism, which reflect actual human nature. These assumptions underlie the problem of economic organization: to create contract and governance structures that economize on bounded rationality while safeguarding transactions against the hazards of opportunism. The book first summarizes the transaction cost economics approach to the study of economic organization. It develops the underlying behavioral assumptions and the types of transactions; alternative approaches to the world of contracts are presented. Assuming that firms are best regarded as a governance structure, a comparative institutional approach to the governance of contractual relations is set out. The evidence, theory, and policy of vertical integration are discussed, on the basis that the decision to integrate is paradigmatic to transaction cost analysis. The incentives and bureaucratic limits of internal organization are presented, including the dilemma of why a large firm can't do everything a collection of small firms can do. The economics of organization in presented in terms of transaction costs, showing that hierarchy also serves efficiency and permits a variety of predictions about the organization of work. Efficient labor organization is explored; on the assumption that an authority relation prevails between workers and managers, what governance structure supports will be made in response to various types of job attributes are discussed, and implications for union organization are developed. Considering antitrust ramifications of transaction cost economics, the book summarizes transaction cost issues that arise in the context of contracting, merger, and strategic behavior, and challenges earlier antitrust preoccupation with monopoly.

The theoretical model frames opportunism as a determinant of transaction costs and implicates cooperation and formalization as control structures that alleviate opportunism. The model also examines whether the proposed theoretical relationships are enduring. Franchisee-franchisor relationships in the Norwegian distribution system of a multinational oil refiner provide the context for analysis. A test of the model using multisample data across two time periods indicates that opportunistic behavior consistently increases transaction costs. Furthermore, cooperative interaction curbs bargaining costs, and formalization reduces opportunism.

Knowledge Flows, Subsidiary Power and Rent-Seeking within MNCs","[""Ram Mudambi"", ""Pietro Navarra""]","In recent years, as multinational corporation (MNC) subsidiaries have become more closely linked to international networks, their knowledge intensity has risen, and some of their R&D has gained a more creative role. Simultaneously, and often connectedly, many subsidiaries have acquired considerable strategic independence in all aspects of their operations, and therefore are able to exercise considerable intra-firm bargaining power to influence the distribution of the firm's resources. In this context, we suggest that intra-MNC knowledge flows are a key determinant of subsidiary bargaining power. We argue that subsidiary managers can exploit such power to pursue their own ends. Such rent-seeking behavior is implicit in much of the literature on managerialism, but our analysis suggests that such behavior can now occur in headquarters-subsidiary and subsidiary-subsidiary relations. Thus subsidiary strategic independence, designed to enhance the competitiveness of outputs (market knowledge) and inputs (asset-seeking and learning), can be corroded when the pursuit of subsidiary objectives encourages rent-seeking. Empirical analysis of a sample of high-technology subsidiaries in the UK provides strong support for the theory. We examine several avenues whereby the incentives of units within the MNC can be aligned.

It considers the transaction to be the ultimate unit of microeconomic analysis, and defines hierarchical transactions as ones for which a single administrative entity spans both sides of the transaction, some form of subordination prevails and, typically, consolidated ownership obtains. Discusses the advantages of the transactional approach by examining three issues: price discrimination, insurance, and vertical integration. Develops the concept of the organizational failure framework, and demonstrates why it is always the combination of human with environmental factors, not either taken by itself, that causes transactional problems. The study also describes each of the transactional relations of interest, and presents the advantages of internal organization with respect to the transactional condition. The analysis explains why primary work groups of the peer group and simple hierarchy types arise. The same transactional factor which impede autonomous contracting between individuals also impede market exchange between technologically separable work groups. Peer groups can be understood as an internal organizational response to the frictions of intermediate product markets, while conglomerate organization can be seen as a response to failures in the capital market. In both contexts, the same human factors, such as bounded rationality and opportunism, occur.

The analysis attempts better to assess the employment relation in circumstances where workers acquire, during the course of the employment, significant job-specific skills and knowledge.

Thus a crucial issue is what power bases are there that the different actors in the federative MNC can use to influence strategic decisions. In this paper, we focus on the power bases associated with the local business network in which the different subsidiaries are embedded, and on the headquarters' knowledge concerning these networks. A causal model is developed and tested with data from 97 subsidiaries in 20 MNC divisions. The results indicate that the strength and influence of a subsidiary's local business network are determined by the extent to which the subsidiary provides technology within the MNC. The fact that the business network is strong does not suffice to augment the intra-organisational power of a subsidiary. In addition, our investigation also provides support for the idea that, when the headquarters has a sound knowledge of the subsidiaries' business networks, it is better able to balance or moderate the influence of strong subsidiaries. The paper concludes by pointing out a potential dilemma facing the headquarters of the federative MNC: externally embedded subsidiaries can provide access to a variety of competencies, but they may also reduce the subsidiaries' interest in contributing to the overall performance of the MNC.

The heterarchical MNC covers a particular brand of geocentric company, which differs significantly from a version that is likely to develop more rapidly in immediate future. Ethnocentric, companies are managed by home country people, and with time there is a lot of rotations between headquarter (HQ) and subsidiaries. The control style will vary in accordance with practice in the parent company and parent country. This chapter examines 'hierarchy' as one governance mode in geocentric firms. The heterarchical MNC differs from standard geocentric one both in terms of strategy and in terms of structure. Strategically, the main dividing line is between exploiting competitive advantages derived from a home country base on the one hand, and actively seeking advantages originating in the global spread of the firm on other.","In such cases it could be better to invest in bonding and make sure that the subsidiary shares the same company culture and adheres to MNC rules of conduct (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1986).","['Most of our explanatory factors appear to drive the ""hard"" governance costs.', 'The main exception is bargaining power that has a significant effect on bonding costs.', 'Subsidiaries gain bargaining power when they possess strategic information and knowledge that other subsidiaries and headquarters in the MNC deem important, but that they find hard to access due to distance and lack of knowledge (Mudambi and Navarra, 2004).', 'For example, the subsidiary could be a center of excellence within the MNC organization and have more expertise than even headquarters (Holm and Pedersen, 2000).', 'When MNCs expand their operations abroad and either buy or develop a new subsidiary, they obtain ownership rights to this subsidiary, but often the subsidiary and its employees retain property rights to certain technologies and to relational and knowledge assets (Hart, 2011).', 'The more tacit these assets, the harder it is for headquarters to use direct/formal or ""hard"" forms of control as the headquarters span of influence simply does not include areas where subsidiaries have property rights control.', 'In such situations MNC headquarters must use more indirect and ""softer"" means of control such as investments in bonding.', 'Our data indicate that when subsidiary property rights (and therefore bargaining power) are high, the composition of governance costs change towards the ""softer"" bonding costs.', 'Since headquarters have less expertise and cannot detail the work of experts from a distant location, the use of more direct and formal mechanisms by headquarters could have resulted in decreased motivation in the subsidiary.', 'In this sense, the MNC resembles a federative system where subsidiaries are embedded locally, pursue own strategies, and headquarters have a less pronounced hierarchical role (Andersson, et al. 2007).', 'In such cases it could be better to invest in bonding and make sure that the subsidiary shares the same company culture and adheres to MNC rules of conduct (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1986).']",0,"['In such cases it could be better to invest in bonding and make sure that the subsidiary shares the same company culture and adheres to MNC rules of conduct (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1986).']"

Spulber's goal is to explain why firms exist, how they are established, and what they contribute to the economy. To accomplish this, Spulber defines a firm to be a transaction institution whose objectives differ from those of its owners.

Taplin""]","This study examines the organizational changes and varied response amongst managers to those changes in seven subsidiaries of multinational apparel firms. Because of intensified competition from low wage economies, such firms have been forced to restructure production processes to heighten both their productive efficiency and attain greater flexibility at the plant level. Much of this change has involved the introduction of high performance work practices (HPWP), a central focus of much recent scholarship on post-Fordism. Drawing from several qualitative strategies, this paper focuses on the role of managers as agents of strategy implementation and discusses how they negotiate, accept or resist such changes. We describe the failure to implement HPWP as some firms seek efficiency gains from work restructuring rather than broader effectiveness goals that would have deepened employee participation. In doing so we theorise about structural impediments to organisational innovation, the operational constraints that render some managers change recipients rather than change agents, and what this might tell us about micro-political strategies within large organisations as key actors negotiate a new organisational reality.High performance work systems Organisation change Management resistance Restructured work Negotiating change","All forms of organizations are subject to risks of opportunism (Williamson, 1975), but opportunism will not disappear with common ownership (Eisenhardt, 1989;Schotter and Beamish, 2011;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2006).","['Given the opportunity, decision-makers can cheat, lie, and violate agreements.', 'All forms of organizations are subject to risks of opportunism (Williamson, 1975), but opportunism will not disappear with common ownership (Eisenhardt, 1989;Schotter and Beamish, 2011;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2006).', 'Cultural, spatial, and institutional distance decrease opportunities for headquarters to monitor subsidiaries, which makes opportunism particularly relevant in headquarters-subsidiary relations (Hennart, 1991), and if opportunities arise, opportunism from subsidiaries may drive ex post governance costs.']",0,"['All forms of organizations are subject to risks of opportunism (Williamson, 1975), but opportunism will not disappear with common ownership (Eisenhardt, 1989;Schotter and Beamish, 2011;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2006).']"

Transaction costs theory seeks to explain which activities are organized within the firm and which ones are performed by independent agents. It is a theory of the role and size of firms. Since multinational enterprises are firms that extend their hierarchies across national boundaries, transaction costs theory can throw considerable light on the reasons behind the existence and the growth of such firms [4; 17; 9; 15]. With a few notable exceptions [5: 9; 15], most applications of the transaction costs approach to the multinational enterprise have focused on the in-ternalization of knowledge. This reflects the postwar predominance of horizontal investments in manufacturing by knowledge-intensive firms. This emphasis on the internalization of knowledge as a cause of multinational expansion may have given the erroneous impression that the applicability of transaction costs theory is restricted to post-World War II multinational enterprises. This paper argues that this is not the case. It seeks to explain the existence and growth of multinational enterprises in the tin industry, and, in the process, shows that transaction costs can be used to account for a very wide range of multinational enterprises, including those that do not fit the traditional mold. Recent research in business history has shown that the growth of European multinational enterprises differed in many ways from that of their *This paper has benefited from frequent discussions with Mira Wilkins and from Steve Nicholas' comments.

Today, conflict is not necessarily regarded as dysfunctional or the result of inefficient global integration. Instead, conflict is now considered a normal consequence of organizing and managing across national borders. This research advances the literature on HQ-subsidiary relationships by adding new insights to the Headquarters-subsidiary conflict discussion, especially in the so far under-researched case of headquarter initiative rejection by foreign subsidiaries. We specifically focus on subsidiary conflict negotiation tactics, the effects of organizational and individual managerial power, and the characteristics and roles of MNC managers that act as boundary spanners during intra-organizational conflict processes. A qualitative, iterative, multiphase research approach was used to develop new theory pertaining to the phenomenon. The results show that in the presence of boundary spanners, dysfunctional conflict is less common and better overall organizational performance can be achieved for both the subsidiary and the MNC as a whole. The results also indicate that the boundary spanning ability is only partly formalizable and that some MNCs are able to foster boundary spanners better than others.Headquarters-subsidiary relationships Intra-organizational conflict Global integration versus local responsiveness Competing demands Boundary spanners Power","All forms of organizations are subject to risks of opportunism (Williamson, 1975), but opportunism will not disappear with common ownership (Eisenhardt, 1989;#AUTHOR_TAG and Beamish, 2011;Taplin, 2006).","['Given the opportunity, decision-makers can cheat, lie, and violate agreements.', 'All forms of organizations are subject to risks of opportunism (Williamson, 1975), but opportunism will not disappear with common ownership (Eisenhardt, 1989;#AUTHOR_TAG and Beamish, 2011;Taplin, 2006).', 'Cultural, spatial, and institutional distance decrease opportunities for headquarters to monitor subsidiaries, which makes opportunism particularly relevant in headquarters-subsidiary relations (Hennart, 1991), and if opportunities arise, opportunism from subsidiaries may drive ex post governance costs.']",0,"['All forms of organizations are subject to risks of opportunism (Williamson, 1975), but opportunism will not disappear with common ownership (Eisenhardt, 1989;#AUTHOR_TAG and Beamish, 2011;Taplin, 2006).', 'Cultural, spatial, and institutional distance decrease opportunities for headquarters to monitor subsidiaries, which makes opportunism particularly relevant in headquarters-subsidiary relations (Hennart, 1991), and if opportunities arise, opportunism from subsidiaries may drive ex post governance costs.']"

Malhotra"", ""Sung S. Kim"", ""Ashutosh Patil""]","Despite recurring concerns about common method variance (CMV) in survey research, the information systems (IS) community remains largely uncertain of the extent of such potential biases. To address this uncertainty, this paper attempts to systematically examine the impact of CMV on the inferences drawn from survey research in the IS area. First, we describe the available approaches for assessing CMV and conduct an empirical study to compare them. From an actual survey involving 227 respondents, we find that although CMV is present in the research areas examined, such biases are not substantial. The results also suggest that few differences exist between the relatively new marker-variable technique and other well-established conventional tools in terms of their ability to detect CMV. Accordingly, the marker-variable technique was employed to infer the effect of CMV on correlations from previously published studies. Our findings, based on the reanalysis of 216 correlations, suggest that the inflated correlation caused by CMV may be expected to be on the order of 0.10 or less, and most of the originally significant correlations remain significant even after controlling for CMV. Finally, by extending the marker-variable technique, we examined the effect of CMV on structural relationships in past literature. Our reanalysis reveals that contrary to the concerns of some skeptics, CMV-adjusted structural relationships not only remain largely significant but also are not statistically differentiable from uncorrected estimates. In summary, this comprehensive and systematic analysis offers initial evidence that (1) the marker-variable technique can serve as a convenient, yet effective, tool for accounting for CMV, and (2) common method biases in the IS domain are not as serious as those found in other disciplines.common method variance, method biases, marker variable, logit analysis, path analysis","Since most of the variables in the study come from a questionnaire, variables in the study may be affected by shared and spurious covariance (Buckley et al., 1990), which can be problematic since measurement artifacts and the phenomenon under investigation can be difficult to separate (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2006).","['Since most of the variables in the study come from a questionnaire, variables in the study may be affected by shared and spurious covariance (Buckley et al., 1990), which can be problematic since measurement artifacts and the phenomenon under investigation can be difficult to separate (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2006).', 'Several precautions were taken to reduce this potential problem: (1) some of the scales were reversed; (2) questions of interest for this study were mixed with other questions not so relevant; and (3) items belonging to one theoretical construct were mixed with items belonging to another variable of interest (Podsakoff et al., 2003).', ""In addition, we performed a Harman's single factor test by including all items in an exploratory (un-rotated) factor analysis (Podsakoff et al., 2003;Podsakoff and Organ, 1986).""]",5,"['Since most of the variables in the study come from a questionnaire, variables in the study may be affected by shared and spurious covariance (Buckley et al., 1990), which can be problematic since measurement artifacts and the phenomenon under investigation can be difficult to separate (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2006).']"

Serva"", ""Mark A. Fuller"", ""Roger C. Mayer""]","This research develops and investigates the concept of reciprocal trust between interacting teams. Reciprocal trust is defined as the trust that results when a party observes the actions of another and reconsiders one's trust-related attitudes and subsequent behaviors based on those observations. Twenty-four teams of systems analysis and design students were involved in a 6-week controlled field study focused on the development of an information systems project. Each team was responsible for both developing a system (development role) and for supervising the development of a system by another team (management role). Risk-taking actions exhibited by one team in an interacting pair were found to predict the other team's trustworthiness perceptions and subsequent trust.

In this context, a key managerial problem relates to the balance between coordination mechanisms and knowledge flows from the subsidiary to the parent company, known as reverse knowledge transfer. It is crucial to understand the interdependencies between subsidiary roles and key coordination mechanisms, such as subsidiary autonomy, personal and electronic-based coordination mechanisms. This paper, therefore, offers new insights into the impact of coordination mechanisms on reverse knowledge transfer. On the basis of a data set consisting of 280 dyads between foreign subsidiaries and their parent companies, two distinctive configurations are found to positively affect the extent of reverse knowledge transfer. The first is the combination of a high degree of subsidiary autonomy and greater use of personal coordination mechanisms, and the second is the combination of low subsidiary autonomy and greater use of electronic-based coordination mechanisms. However, the relevance of these coordination configurations differs for various subsidiary roles.Reverse knowledge transfer Subsidiary roles Personal and electronic-based coordination mechanisms Subsidiary autonomy","To compensate for the differences, both formal and informal initiatives will often be introduced by the companies (Nohria and Ghoshal, 1994;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2011).","['Hence, the MNC headquarters is, according to this logic, faced with both ex ante adaptation challenges -the make or buy decision -and ex post adaptation difficulties.', 'In the latter, potential governance costs will be related to modifying the headquarters-subsidiary relationship to changing conditions.', 'Due to uncertainty, communication and control, as well as imposing general rules and routines are challenging and costly.', 'Uncertainty is high when markets are volatile and hard to predict, the industry is growing fast or markets are diverse containing many different actors (customers, suppliers) with diverse needs.', 'Uncertainty may also be high when home and host markets differ making it difficult for headquarters to understand actions and preferences of local market actors.', 'In these situations of rapid chances and complexity, information will soon be outdated, and common activities become inefficient due to lack of adequate basis of information.', 'Therefore, many companies will routinely increase their monitoring efforts.', 'When cultural differences are large, it is often difficult to create a common company culture where the managers of the subsidiary and at headquarters share the same values and beliefs.', 'To compensate for the differences, both formal and informal initiatives will often be introduced by the companies (Nohria and Ghoshal, 1994;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2011).', 'Along with formalized rules about behaviour and role clarifications, more informal action such as work rotation, project organizations across subsidiaries, common training of managers, open and extensive communication across the MNC, and socialization initiatives will often be introduced.', 'Hence, we would expect an increase in monitoring as well as bonding initiatives due to high cultural differences.', 'Hence, we propose: Hypothesis 2: Ex post governance costs are positively influenced by external factors such as external uncertainty, industry growth and cultural distance.']",0,"['To compensate for the differences, both formal and informal initiatives will often be introduced by the companies (Nohria and Ghoshal, 1994;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2011).']"

Building on transaction costs arguments, and related work in marketing, we analyze vertical coordination as a response to external uncertainty. We show that its effectiveness is highly contingent on the magnitude of the safeguarding problem present. Indeed, its beneficial effects can be overwhelmed by the consequential increase in trading hazards. We use survey data from a sample of 161 industrial buyers to test our hypotheses. When specific investments are modest, greater vertical coordination diminishes transaction difficulties in adapting to high environmental uncertainty. On the other hand, vertical coordination increases transaction difficulties in adapting to high environmental uncertainty when specific investments are substantial.

Hence, a firm needs to have an adequate level of confidence in its partner's cooperative behavior.

We make the argument that trust and control are parallel concepts and that their relationship is of a supplementary character in generating confidence. In addition, we suggest that control mechanisms have an impact on trust level and that the trust level moderates the effect of control mechanisms in determining the control level.

Raj"", ""David Wilemon""]","ABSTRACT: Literature on technology and innovation management has identified the research and development (R&amp;D) and marketing (RDM) interface as a critical organizational complexity that when managed well can affect company success in innovation. Cross-functional teams and collaboration mechanisms, such as boundary spanners, have been identified as solutions to the problems in communication between the two groups. However, these methods have not been as effective as desired and questions still exist as to how boundary spanners are created for success at this crucial interface. This chapter takes a different theoretical perspective: that of creating professional biculturalism in order to effectively manage the RDM interface and thereby enhance creativity and productivity in the innovation process. The culture pertaining to R&amp;D personnel or technologists, meaning engineers and ""hard"" scientists, can be referred to as the T-culture. The culture pertaining to marketing or social ""soft"" scientists (meaning business, sociology, psychology, etc.) can be referred to as the S-culture. Each of these cultures has its own practitioners; languages; modes of analysis; mores; and standards of validation. This chapter specifies propositions regarding the importance of professional biculturalism in bridging the disconnect between the T and S cultures.","Consequently, by implementing more formalized procedures such as rules and routines, clearer role responsibilities, and a better identification of complementary tasks and responsibilities between the MNC and the subsidiary, opportunities for opportunism are reduced (Dahlstrom and Nygaard, 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1987).","['One strategy pertains to reducing opportunism.', 'Previous studies have demonstrated that opportunism can be reduced mainly through two mechanisms: Increased formalization and/or trust.', 'Consequently, by implementing more formalized procedures such as rules and routines, clearer role responsibilities, and a better identification of complementary tasks and responsibilities between the MNC and the subsidiary, opportunities for opportunism are reduced (Dahlstrom and Nygaard, 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1987).', 'Likewise, continuous evaluation of the results, as well as implementation of plans, and budgeting systems in the subsidiary, is sometimes required to limit opportunities for shirking (Baliga and Jaeger, 1984).', 'Furthermore, MNC headquarters may try to increase trust between headquarters and subsidiaries (Harvey, et al., 2011).', 'Trust is normally a result of investment in bonding activities.', 'As our study is cross-sectional, we cannot observe previous investments in bonding for each MNC in our study, but intuitively it seems reasonable that high opportunism may be a result of low bonding investments over time.', 'Trust needs to be built over time and grows when one party starts to behave in a way the other party finds trustworthy (Serva et al., 2005).']",0,"['One strategy pertains to reducing opportunism.', 'Previous studies have demonstrated that opportunism can be reduced mainly through two mechanisms: Increased formalization and/or trust.', 'Consequently, by implementing more formalized procedures such as rules and routines, clearer role responsibilities, and a better identification of complementary tasks and responsibilities between the MNC and the subsidiary, opportunities for opportunism are reduced (Dahlstrom and Nygaard, 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1987).', 'Likewise, continuous evaluation of the results, as well as implementation of plans, and budgeting systems in the subsidiary, is sometimes required to limit opportunities for shirking (Baliga and Jaeger, 1984).']"

The literature indicates that trust in the global organization context increases subsidiary acquiescence to and cooperation with the headquarters, making this concept an important component in developing inpatriates' relationships with the headquarters organization. The purpose of this article is to examine a range of antecedents to trust building, distinguish between two different types of trust, affective vs. competence-based, and examine key outcomes of inpatriates' trust building in global organizations. Reference point theory is used as the foundation for an analysis of the deliberate choice of the inpatriate manager and parent organization alike to adjust to new organizational conditions. In addition, it provides guidance in examining the effects of assignment longevity. The authors propose that through the development of competencies such as trust building, an organization is better able to implement global learning and talent management and in turn develop more effective and ongoing global relationships based on trust.","Furthermore, MNC headquarters may try to increase trust between headquarters and subsidiaries (#AUTHOR_TAG, et al., 2011).","['One strategy pertains to reducing opportunism.', 'Previous studies have demonstrated that opportunism can be reduced mainly through two mechanisms: Increased formalization and/or trust.', 'Consequently, by implementing more formalized procedures such as rules and routines, clearer role responsibilities, and a better identification of complementary tasks and responsibilities between the MNC and the subsidiary, opportunities for opportunism are reduced (Dahlstrom and Nygaard, 1999;Gupta et al., 1987).', 'Likewise, continuous evaluation of the results, as well as implementation of plans, and budgeting systems in the subsidiary, is sometimes required to limit opportunities for shirking (Baliga and Jaeger, 1984).', 'Furthermore, MNC headquarters may try to increase trust between headquarters and subsidiaries (#AUTHOR_TAG, et al., 2011).', 'Trust is normally a result of investment in bonding activities.', 'As our study is cross-sectional, we cannot observe previous investments in bonding for each MNC in our study, but intuitively it seems reasonable that high opportunism may be a result of low bonding investments over time.', 'Trust needs to be built over time and grows when one party starts to behave in a way the other party finds trustworthy (Serva et al., 2005).']",0,"['Furthermore, MNC headquarters may try to increase trust between headquarters and subsidiaries (#AUTHOR_TAG, et al., 2011).', 'Trust is normally a result of investment in bonding activities.']"

Jellinger"", ""Johannes Attems""]","The prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) increases with advancing age, but less so after age 90 years. A retrospective hospital-based study of the relative prevalence of different disorders was performed in 1,110 consecutive autopsy cases of demented elderly in Vienna, Austria (66% females, MMSE <20; mean age 83.3 +- 5.4 SD years). It assessed clinical, general autopsy data and neuropathology including immunohistochemistry. Neuropathologic diagnosis followed current consensus criteria. Four age groups (7-10th decade) were evaluated. In the total cohort AD pathology was seen in 82.9% (""pure"" AD 42.9%; AD + other pathologies 39.9%), VD in 10.8% (mixed dementia, MIX, i.e. AD + vascular encephalopathy in 5.5%); other disorders in 5.7%, and negative pathology in 0.8%. The relative prevalence of AD increased from age 60 to 89 years and decreased slightly after age 90+, while ""pure"" VD diagnosed in the presence of vascular encephalopathy of different types with low neuritic AD pathology (Braak stages <3; mean 1.2-1.6) decreased progressively from age 60 to 90+; 85-95% of these patients had histories of diabetes, morphologic signs of hypertension, 65% myocardial infarction/cardiac decompensation, and 75% a history of stroke(s). Morphologic subtypes, subcortical arteriosclerotic (the most frequent), multi-infarct encephalopathy, and strategic infarct dementia showed no age-related differences. The relative prevalence of AD + Lewy pathology remained fairly constant with increasing age. Mixed dementia and AD with minor cerebrovascular lesions increased significantly with age, while other dementias decreased. This retrospective study using strict morphologic criteria confirmed increased prevalence of AD with age, but mild decline at age 90+, and progressive decline of VD, while AD + vascular pathologies including MIX showed considerable age-related increase, confirming that mixed pathologies account for most dementia cases in very old persons. A prospective clinicopathologic study in oldest-old subjects showed a significant increase in both AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), but decrease in VD over age 85, while in a small group of old subjects CAA without considerable AD pathology may be an independent risk factor for cognitive decline.","These vessel disorders frequently occur in the brains of elderly individuals and become more prevalent and severe with advancing age (#AUTHOR_TAG and Attems, 2010a).","['The vessel disorders that are most frequently associated with VaD are atherosclerosis of cerebral arteries (AS), arteriosclerosis or cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (Ince, 2005;Hachinski et al., 2006;Kalaria and Erkinjuntti, 2006;Hauw et al., 2008;Ferrer, 2010;Attems et al., 2011).', 'These vessel disorders frequently occur in the brains of elderly individuals and become more prevalent and severe with advancing age (#AUTHOR_TAG and Attems, 2010a).', 'There are less common forms of CVD, including various types of vasculitis and inherited diseases that affect vessel integrity, some of which are associated with the development of dementia in the absence of AD, e.g., CADASIL.']",1,"['These vessel disorders frequently occur in the brains of elderly individuals and become more prevalent and severe with advancing age (#AUTHOR_TAG and Attems, 2010a).']"
CC2914,1385821,Policy and practice in the use of root cause analysis to investigate clinical adverse events: Mind the gap,Davide Nicolini,Constructing and re-constructing narratives of patient safety,"[""Justin J. Waring""]","In the pursuit of enhanced patient safety, new forms of organisational learning have been introduced within healthcare services across the developed world. This paper examines how these systems contribute to the creation of knowledge about patient safety. The approach taken in this paper departs significantly from methods found within mainstream patient safety research. Rather than attempting to define clinical incidents through taxonomies or classifications, it considers how knowledge is socially constructed in clinical practice and through the processes of risk management. Specifically, it considers how narratives - the stories produced by staff in a large teaching hospital in the UK - about patient safety events are developed within the interactions of clinical practice, reflecting a dynamic mix of emotion and shared notions of responsibility. It then shows how these are re-produced as incident reports which transform knowledge through check-boxes and pre-defined categorisations leading to de-contextualised 'narrow narratives'. The paper then examines how these accounts are further re-produced through risk management activities as they become de-authored and re-constructed to reflect managerial assumptions about learning. Through considering how patient safety narratives emerge through these processes, the paper highlights the contribution that ethnographic research, with a particular focus on narrative construction, can make to the study of patient safety. It offers an alternative to the current orthodoxy of policy and raises questions about the capacity of such systems to shape the production of knowledge to the determinant of service improvement and to act as a mechanism of organisational power.","By the same token, the emotional elements that transpired through the individual statements and in the meetings were gradually filtered out when the narrative elements were substituted by a more causal type of account in the final report (see also #AUTHOR_TAG, 2009).","[""The need for a document that 'looked good' required significant effort by the authors to use the appropriate RCA language or jargon."", 'While this seldom surfaced in the multidisciplinary meetings, it was strategically reintroduced during the drafting process, seemingly to give credibility to the process.', 'In this way, mistakes became ""care and service delivery problems"" and ""contributory factors"" were decided post facto on the basis of group discussion.', 'The analysis thus continued well into the writing process, but in a less open and participatory way, with the report conveying a story often quite different from the one that emerged during the RCA meetings.', 'In short, the reports were more ""politically correct"", simpler and imbued with the language of RCA.', 'By the same token, the emotional elements that transpired through the individual statements and in the meetings were gradually filtered out when the narrative elements were substituted by a more causal type of account in the final report (see also #AUTHOR_TAG, 2009).']",2,"['By the same token, the emotional elements that transpired through the individual statements and in the meetings were gradually filtered out when the narrative elements were substituted by a more causal type of account in the final report (see also #AUTHOR_TAG, 2009).']"

Analysis of the meeting transcript reveals on three levels that clinical members of the team struggle with framing the uncertain and contradictory details of situated clinical activity and translating these first into 'root causes', and then into recommendations for practice change. This analysis puts two challenges into special relief. First, RCA team members find themselves in the unusual position of having to derive organizational-managerial generalizations from the specifics of in situ activity. Second, they are constrained by the expectation inscribed into RCA that their recommendations result in 'systems improvements' assumed to flow forth from an extension of formal rules and spread of procedures. We argue that this perspective misrecognizes the importance of RCA as a means to engender solutions that leave the procedural detail of clinical processes unspecified, and produce cross-hospital discussions about the organizational dimensions of care.","While RCA is formally endorsed by policy makers in USA, UK, Australia, and Denmark (��vretveit, 2005) and is in the process of being adopted by other countries, we have only a partial understanding of the challenges of using this approach, despite research suggesting it is not without problems (Braithwaite, Westbrook, Mallock, Travaglia, & Iedema, 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG, Jorm, Long et al., 2006;Wallace, 2006;Wu, Lipshutz, & Pronovost, 2008).","['While RCA is formally endorsed by policy makers in USA, UK, Australia, and Denmark (��vretveit, 2005) and is in the process of being adopted by other countries, we have only a partial understanding of the challenges of using this approach, despite research suggesting it is not without problems (Braithwaite, Westbrook, Mallock, Travaglia, & Iedema, 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG, Jorm, Long et al., 2006;Wallace, 2006;Wu, Lipshutz, & Pronovost, 2008).', 'Building on an extensive 12-month ethnographic study within two large acute hospitals in the UK National Health Service (NHS), we examine how the investigation of clinical incidents is conducted in practice.', 'Our main aim is to determine the challenges of using the RCA approach and to understand where such challenges originate.', 'Our main finding is that the problems observed stem from an inherent tension that derives from RCA being conceived not only as an improvement technique but also as a governance tool.', 'We argue that the approach, which originally responded to a logic of learning, empowerment and decentralisation, is often translated into practice as a bureaucratic mode of legitimation and governance.', 'Although these principles often co-exist, at times they diverge so that the effort is averted from producing organisational learning.', 'We argue that a better understanding of these tensions may help introduce corrective actions which may lead to a better use of this particular approach to improve patient safety.']",0,"['While RCA is formally endorsed by policy makers in USA, UK, Australia, and Denmark (��vretveit, 2005) and is in the process of being adopted by other countries, we have only a partial understanding of the challenges of using this approach, despite research suggesting it is not without problems (Braithwaite, Westbrook, Mallock, Travaglia, & Iedema, 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG, Jorm, Long et al., 2006;Wallace, 2006;Wu, Lipshutz, & Pronovost, 2008).', 'Building on an extensive 12-month ethnographic study within two large acute hospitals in the UK National Health Service (NHS), we examine how the investigation of clinical incidents is conducted in practice.', 'Our main aim is to determine the challenges of using the RCA approach and to understand where such challenges originate.', 'Our main finding is that the problems observed stem from an inherent tension that derives from RCA being conceived not only as an improvement technique but also as a governance tool.']"

This paper seeks to understand the value of root cause analysis (RCA) recommendations for practice improvement purposes. The paper presents an analysis of interviews with nine senior health managers who were asked about their views on RCA as practice improvement method. Design/methodology/approach Interview data were collected as part of a multi-method evaluation consultancy project investigating a local Health Safety Improvement Program. The interview data were discourse analysed and arranged into over-arching themes. Findings The analysis reveals rather negative views of the improvement potential of RCA: RCA is subject to too many constraints to be able to produce valuable recommendations; RCA recommendations: are perceived to be of ""variable quality""; generate considerable extra work for senior management to do with vetting RCA recommendations; are experienced as contributing in only a limited way to organizational and practice improvement. Research limitations/implications This study focuses on nine interviewees only and presents an analysis of single (not multiple) interviews. However, these nine interviewees fulfil crucial roles in implementing clinical practice improvement initiatives in their respective geographic areas. Practical implications The findings suggest that RCA requires much time and negotiation, and that the recommendations produced may not live up to the philosophy of clinical practice improvement's expectations. It may be necessary to reorient the expectations of the power of RCA, or accept that RCA produces communication about clinical processes that would otherwise not have taken place, and whose effects may not be registering for some time to come. Originality/value Besides drawing out the implications for RCA as investigative practice, the analysis argues that interviewees' responses harbour indications to suggest that these officials are finding themselves engaged in increasing levels of communicative and emotional labour, in having to manage and compensate for the ambiguities, incommensurabilities and conflicting goals inscribed into ""post-bureaucratic"" initiatives such as RCA.

Bagian"", ""John Gosbee"", ""Caryl Z. Lee"", ""Linda Williams"", ""Scott D. McKnight"", ""Dea M. Mannos""]","Background: The patient safety program in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) began in 1998, when the National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) was established to lead the effort on a day-to-day basis. NCPS provides the structure, training, and tools, and VA facilities provide front-line expertise, feedback about the process, and root cause analysis (RCA) of adverse events and close calls. Monitoring the process: Facility patient safety managers determine the disposition of adverse events and close calls occurring at their facilities. They use a safety assessment code (SAC) to prioritize the actual and potential severity and frequency of an event. BEFORE-AND-AFTER STUDY: Before the new RCA system was implemented in 2000, the VA used another adverse event reporting system, focused review (FR). A comparison of the two processes indicates that the RCA process has shifted analyses of adverse events toward a human factors engineering approach-entailing a search for system vulnerabilities rather than human errors and other less actionable root causes. Case examples: Two case examples--on hazards in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) room and on a cardiac pacemaker malfunction--illustrate how the RCA system works in actual operation.

CC2924,1385821,Policy and practice in the use of root cause analysis to investigate clinical adverse events: Mind the gap,Davide Nicolini,Adaptive regulation or governmentality: patient safety and the changing regulation of medicine,"[""Justin Waring""]","This paper explores how current 'patient safety' reforms offer to change the regulation of medicine. Drawing on existing literature, it is argued that this policy agenda represents a new frontier in medical/managerial relations, introducing a disciplinary expertise within the health service that provides managers with the knowledge and legitimacy to survey and scrutinise medical performance, made real through procedures for incident reporting and root-cause analysis. The extent of regulatory change is investigated, drawing on an ethnographic case study of one hospital. It is shown that, as with other organisational and managerial reforms, doctors are resisting managerial prerogatives through seeking to subvert and 'capture' components of reform. I describe this as 'adaptive regulation' to account for how doctors seek to maintain their regulatory monopoly and limit managerial encroachment. It is speculated, however, that this process could signal the future 'modernisation' of medical professionalism where emerging managerial discourses, within the wider context of public sector reform, are increasingly internalised with medical practice and culture. This leads to new and rearticulated forms of self-surveillance, self-management or 'governmentality', ultimately negating the need for external groups to explicitly manage or regulate professional practice.","We are also aware that RCA has been interpreted as an emerging form of self-surveillance (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007) and potentially extending the principle of concertive control among healthcare practitioners (Iedema, Jorm, Long et al., 2006).","['Such research suggests that, despite its potential, the translation and use of RCA in healthcare remains problematic.', 'RCA, it might be argued, is a highly context-specific model for learning that largely reflects the experiences and safety improvements witnessed in industries such as aviation and petrochemicals.', ""In these nonhealthcare settings, the 'human factors' approach has been instrumental in bringing about a radical shift in operational safety, whilst the RCA toolbox has been integral to producing recommendations for change."", 'A growing body of research suggests, however, that the translation and replication of these successes in healthcare appears increasingly difficult.', 'The notion of ""translation"" suggests that ideas, methods, and policies are not mechanically transferred or implemented from one setting to another.', 'Instead, they travel in the guise of textualised intermediaries thanks to potential users who perceive some benefits from their adoption.', 'Such travel in time and space thus depends on transformation, editing, and appropriation.', 'Because there are always several possible competing interpretations of any idea, the way in which this is translated in practice is necessarily determined by specific interests and logic.', 'The result is partial acceptance and adaptation, but also addition, substantial modification and even radical reinterpretation (Latour, 1986, talks about ""betrayal"").', 'The translation of RCA from industry to healthcare thus involves the influence of multiple and competing interests and logics that reinterpret and reframe the investigation process to align with established ways of working and enduring lines of power.', 'Underling tension may exist between the espoused aspiration of learning and the organisational context within which this learning is to take place.', ""Accordingly, our aim in this paper is to understand further how RCA is used in practice and to bring to the fore the 'gap' between theory and practice as found in the translation of RCA into healthcare."", 'It is worth noting that our study intentionally eschews arguing whether RCA is right or wrong, or commenting on specific features of the approach.', 'For example, we are aware that RCA is performed as a specific way of talking about, thinking of, and doing safety e what Zuiderent-Jerak, Strating, Nieboer, and Bal (2009) call a specific ""safety ontology"".', 'This is characterised by a clinical/scientific approach (Iedema, Jorm, Long et al., 2006) and an orientation towards a ""lack view"" of safety (Mesman, 2009), that is, an approach that sees safety improvements stemming from the correction of organisational problems instead of, for instance, developing existing sources of resilience.', 'We are also aware that RCA has been interpreted as an emerging form of self-surveillance (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007) and potentially extending the principle of concertive control among healthcare practitioners (Iedema, Jorm, Long et al., 2006).', ""However, reflecting Vincent's (2009) exhortation that social science research should try to contribute positively to the cause of patient safety (see also Iedema, 2009), our underlying focus is to explore whether within these limits the particular way in which RCA has been translated in practice in the UK risks stifling its potential to generate organisational learning and thus safer healthcare.""]",1,"['We are also aware that RCA has been interpreted as an emerging form of self-surveillance (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007) and potentially extending the principle of concertive control among healthcare practitioners (Iedema, Jorm, Long et al., 2006).']"

Literature already available in the Clinical Risk Unit, University College London. Work by known experts in the field of accident investigation and analysis. Electronic databases including PsycINFO and MEDLINE. Websites for accident investigation reports. Twelve techniques from other high-risk industries were reviewed in detail using criteria developed for the purpose. This review provided a conceptual framework for the healthcare review and appraisal process, as well as providing a critical assessment of the industry techniques. Rigorous searching and screening identified 138 papers for formal appraisal and a further 114 were designated as providing potentially useful background information. A formal appraisal instrument was designed, piloted and modified until acceptable reliability was achieved. From the 138 papers, six techniques were identified as representing clearly definable approaches to incident investigation and analysis. All relevant papers were reviewed for each of the six techniques: Australian Incident Monitoring System, the Critical Incident Technique, Significant Event Auditing, Root Cause Analysis, Organisational Accident Causation Model and Comparison with Standards approach. All healthcare techniques had the potential of being applied in any specialty or discipline related to healthcare. While a few studies looked solely at death as an outcome, most used a variety of outcomes including near misses. Most techniques used interviewing and primary document review to investigate incidents. All techniques included papers that identified clinical issues and some attempt to assess underlying errors, causes and contributory factors. However the extent and sophistication of the various attempts varied widely. Only a third of papers referred to an established model of accident causation. In most studies examined there was little or no information on the training of investigators, how the data was extracted or any information on quality assurance for data collection and analysis. There was some variation in the level of expertise and training required but to undertake the investigation to an acceptable depth all required some expertise. In most papers there was little or no discussion of implementation of any changes as a result of the investigations. A quarter of publications gave some description of the implementation of changes, though few addressed evaluation of changes. The reviews demonstrate that, while much valuable work has been accomplished, there is considerable potential for further development of techniques, the utilisation of a wider range of techniques and a need for validation and evaluation of existing methods which would make incident investigation more versatile and use limited resources more effectively. Further exploration of techniques used in high-risk industries, with interviews and observation of actual investigations should prove valuable. Existing healthcare techniques would benefit from formal evaluation of their outcomes and effectiveness.

NCPS's aim is to foster a culture of safety in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) by developing and providing patient safety programs and delivering standardized tools, methods, and initiatives to the 163 VA facilities.To create a system-oriented approach to patient safety, NCPS looked for models in fields such as aviation, nuclear power, human factors, and safety engineering. Core concepts included a non-punitive approach to patient safety activities that emphasizes systems-based learning, the active seeking out of close calls, which are viewed as opportunities for learning and investigation, and the use of interdisciplinary teams to investigate close calls and adverse events through a root cause analysis (RCA) process. Participation by VA facilities and networks was voluntary. NCPS has always aimed to develop a program that would be applicable both within the VA and beyond.NCPS's full patient safety program was tested and implemented throughout the VA system from November 1999 to August 2000. Program components included an RCA system for use by caregivers at the front line, a system for the aggregate review of RCA results, information systems software, alerts and advisories, and cognitive acids.

The study sample comprised managers, clinicians, administrators and human resource personnel (n = 38) employed at Band 6 or above, and 18 key organizational stakeholders from three National Health Service case study sites who seconded staff to the Root Cause Analysis programme. Although the study was primarily designed to assess the impact of using a blended e-learning approach to educate staff about Root Cause Analysis, participants revealed that working in interprofessional teams was a vital element of any patient-safety investigation. Interprofessional learning and inter-disciplinary collaboration was a particularly valued element of the training programme. One of the main benefits of interprofessional learning identified by participants was that it improved networking and promoted more open communication. Moreover, participants felt interprofessional learning allowed them to increase their understanding of each other's roles, leading to greater cooperation, collaboration and increased confidence. For this reason, the paper examines the extent to which the management of patient-safety-related incidents and patient-safety investigations can be improved by using an interprofessional learning format. Finally, the study will suggest that interprofessional approaches to patient-safety education should be adopted by course designers so as to encourage participants to think beyond their respective occupational silos.","We found that this process was appreciated by participants as an opportunity to better understand how different clinical practices interface e in itself a powerful tool for preventing future mishaps (see also #AUTHOR_TAG, Carlisle, Hall, & Attree, 2008).","['At the core of the RCA process is the multidisciplinary meeting of the investigation team.', 'The meetings observed lasted between one and 3 h.', 'During these activities, the information collected by the RCA lead was presented, analysed and discussed, and a judgement made on the causes leading to the event.', 'Participants also identified the remedial actions needed to prevent reoccurrence through drafting an action plan.', 'We found that this process was appreciated by participants as an opportunity to better understand how different clinical practices interface e in itself a powerful tool for preventing future mishaps (see also #AUTHOR_TAG, Carlisle, Hall, & Attree, 2008).', 'While an in-depth analysis of the RCA meetings goes beyond the scope of this work, three issues repeatedly emerged from our research.']",2,"['We found that this process was appreciated by participants as an opportunity to better understand how different clinical practices interface e in itself a powerful tool for preventing future mishaps (see also #AUTHOR_TAG, Carlisle, Hall, & Attree, 2008).']"

It is now high on the healthcare quality agenda in many countries of the world including the UK. The recognition that human error is inevitable in a highly complex and technical field like medicine is a first step in promoting greater awareness of the importance of systems failure in the causation of accidents. Plane crashes are not usually caused by pilot error per se but by an amalgam of technical, environmental, organisational, social and communication factors which predispose to human error or worsen its consequences. In healthcare, the systematic investigation of error in the administration of medication will often reveal similarly complex causation. Experience and research from other sectors, in particular the airline industry, show that the impact of human error can be reduced if the necessary work is put in to detect and then remove weaknesses and vulnerabilties in the system. The NHS is putting in place a comprehensive programme to learn more effectively from adverse events and near misses. This aims to reduce the burden of the estimated 850,000 adverse events which occur in hospitals each year as well as targeting high risk areas such as medication error.","This approach to organisational learning is based on the assumption that through determining the underlying causes of adverse events and drawing the necessary lessons, it is possible to prevent their reoccurrence (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2000).","['In line with the global patient safety agenda, an increasing number of healthcare institutions have adopted structured investigation processes as a way of learning from clinical incidents.', 'This approach to organisational learning is based on the assumption that through determining the underlying causes of adverse events and drawing the necessary lessons, it is possible to prevent their reoccurrence (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2000).', ""A common way to investigate clinical incidents is through Root Cause Analysis (RCA), a methodology combining elements from engineering, psychology, and the 'human factors' tradition (Reason, 1990;Vincent, Taylor-Adams, & Stanhope, 1998)."", 'As indicated by its name, RCA directs analytical attention to the root or latent factors that condition, enable or exacerbate clinical risk with the aim of producing recommendations on how these underlying causes should be managed or eradicated (Carroll, Rudolph, & Hatakenaka, 2002).']",0,"['This approach to organisational learning is based on the assumption that through determining the underlying causes of adverse events and drawing the necessary lessons, it is possible to prevent their reoccurrence (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2000).', ""A common way to investigate clinical incidents is through Root Cause Analysis (RCA), a methodology combining elements from engineering, psychology, and the 'human factors' tradition (Reason, 1990;Vincent, Taylor-Adams, & Stanhope, 1998).""]"

A questionnaire was administered to 42 obstetricians and 156 midwives at the same two obstetric units, exploring the reasons for low rates of reporting. Questions concerned their knowledge of their unit's incident reporting system; whether they would report a series of 10 designated adverse obstetric incidents to the risk manager; and their views on 12 potential reasons for not reporting incidents. Most staff knew about the incident-reporting system in their unit, but almost 30% did not know how to find a list of reportable incidents. Views on the necessity of reporting the 10 designated obstetric incidents varied considerably. For example, 96% of staff stated they would always report a maternal death, whereas less than 40% would report a baby's unexpected admission to the Special Care Baby Unit. Midwives said they were more likely to report incidents than doctors, and junior staff were more likely to report than senior staff. The main reasons for not reporting were fears that junior staff would be blamed, high workload and the belief (even though the incident was designated as reportable) that the circumstances or outcome of a particular case did not warrant a report. Junior doctors felt less supported by their colleagues than senior doctors. Current systems of incident reporting, while providing some valuable information, do not provide a reliable index of the rate of adverse incidents. Recommended measures to increase reliability include clearer definitions of incidents, simplified methods of reporting, designated staff to record incidents and education, feedback and reassurance to staff about the nature and purpose of such systems.","These were normally associated with diary conflicts (#AUTHOR_TAG, Stanhope, & Crowley Murphy, 1999), but underlying this was a general sense that staff, especially clinicians, did not want to participate in the process.","['Convening the RCA meeting While collecting evidence, RCA leads would usually start arrangements for convening the RCA meeting, where evidence would be analysed and latent factors discussed.', 'Although the composition of these groups varied according to the incident in question, they typically involved the local service manager, senior nursing and medical representatives, line managers, corporate representatives for Patient Safety (who might also lead the process) and, in some occasions, the healthcare providers directly involved in the incident.', 'There were common difficulties in forming this group.', 'These were normally associated with diary conflicts (#AUTHOR_TAG, Stanhope, & Crowley Murphy, 1999), but underlying this was a general sense that staff, especially clinicians, did not want to participate in the process.', 'In most cases, resistance to participation was not open and staff resorted to what was described as ""e-mail politicking"" whereby staff simply ignored phone calls or automatically discarded emails related to the RCA.']",1,"['Convening the RCA meeting While collecting evidence, RCA leads would usually start arrangements for convening the RCA meeting, where evidence would be analysed and latent factors discussed.', 'Although the composition of these groups varied according to the incident in question, they typically involved the local service manager, senior nursing and medical representatives, line managers, corporate representatives for Patient Safety (who might also lead the process) and, in some occasions, the healthcare providers directly involved in the incident.', 'These were normally associated with diary conflicts (#AUTHOR_TAG, Stanhope, & Crowley Murphy, 1999), but underlying this was a general sense that staff, especially clinicians, did not want to participate in the process.']"

However, little is known about how faculty perceive community college transfer students and how they make meaning of their interactions with these students. This qualitative, descriptive, ethnographic interview study describes faculty/student interaction and the ways in which community college transfer students are perceived by the faculty at one small, private, nonprofit, masters-level university. The research questions used for this study were designed to investigate the faculty's perception of community college students, the students' academic experiences and the faculty/student relationship. The researcher gathered data during 12 in-depth interviews. The site was selected because of the limited research available on community college transfer students at small private colleges. An ethnographic design captured the distinct cultural influences of the study site and helped to answer to the study's overarching research question: how do faculty perceive community college transfer students and the institution from which the student transferred? The findings from this study can guide meaningful conversations on private, four-year campuses directed toward improving how faculty/student relationships, systematic transfer processes, transfer programs and campus culture influence community college transfer student success. A thematic analysis of the interview data revealed four themes. The first, Student/Faculty Relationship: A Two-Way Street of Hesitation and Reluctance, describes how both community college transfer students, and the faculty that teach them, are hesitant and reluctant to work with one another. The second, A Balancing Act: Aligning Faculty and Student Expectations, relates to the fact that what a faculty member expects of a student, and what students perceive to be expected of them, should align for the student to be successful. The third, A Second Class Institution: The Community College as a Stepping Stone describes how faculty perceive attending a community college as a stepping stone towards more prestigious goal of attending a four year institution. Finally, the fourth theme, Isolation: A Community College Transfer Experience, details the ways community college transfer students are perceived as intentionally, and unintentionally, given a separate university experience, and the ways in which this Isolation disadvantages these students. These findings are significant for both universities similar to the study site and for those that wish to understand the community college transfer student experience across institutional types","Overall, we conducted 120 days of observations across the two sites, carried out 102 ethnographic interviews (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1979) and 34 semi-structured interviews.","['Our fieldwork was carried out over three phases.', 'First, we identified the patient safety procedures within each Trust through observations and interviews within the respective Patient Safety department over one month.', 'Second, we investigated the similarities and differences between the two organisations through conducting a series of interviews and observations with frontline clinical departments.', 'Third, we observed, tracked and documented 10 incident investigations from start to finish (including the RCA meetings) within these departments, split equally between Trusts.', 'After the conclusion of each RCA, we conducted follow-up semistructured interviews with members of the team to explore their experiences of the process and learn more about subsequent change.', 'Overall, we conducted 120 days of observations across the two sites, carried out 102 ethnographic interviews (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1979) and 34 semi-structured interviews.', 'A summary of the fieldwork is provided in Table 1.']",5,"['Overall, we conducted 120 days of observations across the two sites, carried out 102 ethnographic interviews (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1979) and 34 semi-structured interviews.']"

CC2936,1385821,Policy and practice in the use of root cause analysis to investigate clinical adverse events: Mind the gap,Davide Nicolini,Power and emotion in organizational learning,"[""Russ Vince""]",": This paper addresses an aspect of organizational learning that has not been extensively developed - the impact of emotion on organizational learning. The study of emotion in organizations is seen as an important part of the development of organizational learning. The paper argues that attention to the emotional dynamics of organizing,  and to the links between emotion and organizational politics, will increase the possibilities for understanding organizational learning. Awareness of the impact of emotion on organizational learning can be developed through an investigation of two areas. First, organizational learning is more than a product of organizational responses to individual learning. Emotion contributes to a broader understanding of systemic learning. Second, emotion is important to strategic aspects of organizational learning. There is a link between the emotional and the political within organizations. The paper contains a discussion of these themes using brief case examples to illustrate and develop the issues.","In particular, the way RCA has been translated into practice ignores the idea that learning often stems from the inquiry process itself, not the report; that the inquiry process should not be divorced from the practice of clinical work; that emotions are part and parcel of the organisational learning process (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2001); and that focussing on feasible solutions (a closure orientation) and emphasising consensus reduces the capacity to learn through creativity and divergent thinking (cf.","['These serve to partially displace the espoused goal of preventing the reoccurrence of patient safety incidents through organizational learning.', 'While the current model of RCA is clearly a significant improvement on previous approaches to learning, it might still be argued that it does not fulfil its potential and is not always conducive to learning.', 'In particular, the way RCA has been translated into practice ignores the idea that learning often stems from the inquiry process itself, not the report; that the inquiry process should not be divorced from the practice of clinical work; that emotions are part and parcel of the organisational learning process (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2001); and that focussing on feasible solutions (a closure orientation) and emphasising consensus reduces the capacity to learn through creativity and divergent thinking (cf.', 'Engestr�_m, 2001).']",1,"['In particular, the way RCA has been translated into practice ignores the idea that learning often stems from the inquiry process itself, not the report; that the inquiry process should not be divorced from the practice of clinical work; that emotions are part and parcel of the organisational learning process (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2001); and that focussing on feasible solutions (a closure orientation) and emphasising consensus reduces the capacity to learn through creativity and divergent thinking (cf.']"

There are fundamental differences between thinking about past and future events that need to be kept in clear view if we are to make progress in understanding the nature of mental time travel.

Wong"", ""Daniel L. Schacter""]","People can consciously re-experience past events and pre-experience possible future events. This fMRI study examined the neural regions mediating the construction and elaboration of past and future events. Participants were cued with a noun for 20s and instructed to construct a past or future event within a specified time period (week, year, 5-20 years). Once participants had the event in mind, they made a button press and for the remainder of the 20s elaborated on the event. Importantly, all events generated were episodic and did not differ on a number of phenomenological qualities (detail, emotionality, personal significance, field/observer perspective). Conjunction analyses indicated the left hippocampus was commonly engaged by past and future event construction, along with posterior visuospatial regions, but considerable neural differentiation was also observed during the construction phase. Future events recruited regions involved in prospective thinking and generation processes, specifically right frontopolar cortex and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively. Furthermore, future event construction uniquely engaged the right hippocampus, possibly as a response to the novelty of these events. In contrast to the construction phase, elaboration was characterized by remarkable overlap in regions comprising the autobiographical memory retrieval network, attributable to the common processes engaged during elaboration, including self-referential processing, contextual and episodic imagery. This striking neural overlap is consistent with findings that amnesic patients exhibit deficits in both past and future thinking, and confirms that the episodic system contributes importantly to imagining the future.","Brain imaging shows considerable overlap in brain activation between the two, with slightly more frontal-lobe activity in imagining the future (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007).","['Memory, both episodic and semantic (Klein, 2013), provides the ingredients for imagining possible future events.', 'What has been termed episodic foresight (Suddendorf, 2010), along with autobiographic memory and theory of mind, also makes up much of our mind wandering (Spreng and Grady, 2009), as we preview some future activity or consider possible future options in order to select appropriate action.', 'The capacity to mentally relive past events and imagine possible future ones comprises has been termed mental time travel (Suddendorf andCorballis, 1997, 2007), taking us into an imagined future as well as into an imagined past.', 'Both are essentially constructive processes.', 'Brain imaging shows considerable overlap in brain activation between the two, with slightly more frontal-lobe activity in imagining the future (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007).', 'Critical to both is the hippocampus, whose role is discussed in more detail below.']",2,"['Brain imaging shows considerable overlap in brain activation between the two, with slightly more frontal-lobe activity in imagining the future (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007).']"

On the other hand, cognitive studies have found animals to have abilities once thought unique to the human. This suggests a disparity between brain and mind. The suggestion is misleading. Cognitive research has not kept pace with neural research. Neural findings are based on microscopic study of the brain and are primarily cellular. Because cognition cannot be studied microscopically, we need to refine the study of cognition by using a different approach. In examining claims of similarity between animals and humans, one must ask: What are the dissimilarities? This approach prevents confusing similarity with equivalence. We follow this approach in examining eight cognitive cases--teaching, short-term memory, causal reasoning, planning, deception, transitive inference, theory of mind, and language--and find, in all cases, that similarities between animal and human abilities are small, dissimilarities large.

Stone artifact manufacture, large mammal butchery, and novel transport and discard behaviors led to the accumulation of the first recognized archaeological debris. The appearance of the Oldowan sites coincides with generally cooler, drier, and more variable climatic conditions across Africa, probably resulting in a net decrease in woodland foods and an increase in large mammal biomass compared to the early and middle Pliocene. Shifts in plant food resource availability may have provided the stimulus for incorporating new foods into the diet, including meat from scavenged carcasses butchered with stone tools. Oldowan artifact form varies with clast size, shape, raw material physical properties, and flaking intensity. Oldowan hominins preferred hard raw materials with good fracture characteristics. Habitual stone transport is evident from technological analysis, and raw material sourcing to date suggests that stone was rarely moved more than 2-3 km from source. Oldowan debris accumulation was spatially redundant, reflecting recurrent visitation of attractive points on the landscape. Thin archaeological horizons from Bed I Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, were probably formed and buried in less than 10 years and document hominin processing of multiple carcasses per year. Transport beyond simple refuging behavior is suggested by faunal density at some site levels. By 2.0 Ma, hominin rank within the predatory guild may have been moderately high, as they probably accessed meaty carcasses through hunting and confrontational scavenging, and hominin-carnivore competition appears minimal at some sites. It is likely that both Homo habilis sensu stricto and early African H. erectus made Oldowan tools. H. habilis sensu stricto was more encephalized than Australopithecus and may foreshadow H. erectus in lower limb elongation and some thermoregulatory adaptations to hot, dry climatic conditions. H. erectus was large and wide-ranging, had a high total energy expenditure, and required a high-quality diet.

However, biased datasets can also hurt the generalization performance of trained models and give untrustworthy evaluation results. For many NLSM datasets, the providers select some pairs of sentences into the datasets, and this sampling procedure can easily bring unintended pattern, i.e., selection bias. One example is the QuoraQP dataset, where some content-independent naive features are unreasonably predictive. Such features are the reflection of the selection bias and termed as the leakage features. In this paper, we investigate the problem of selection bias on six NLSM datasets and find that four out of them are significantly biased.

Recent research suggests that ease of comprehending predictable elements is due to prediction rather than facilitated integration, and that comprehension is accompanied by covert imitation. We argue that comprehenders use prediction and imitation to construct an ÔemulatorÕ, using the production system, and combine predictions with the input dynamically. Such a process helps to explain the rapidity of comprehension and the robust interpretation of ambiguous or noisy input. This framework is in line with a general trend in cognitive science to incorporate action systems into perceptual systems and has broad implications for understanding the links between language production and comprehension.","This can not only disambiguate upcoming utterances, but also facilitate rapid comprehension and help the listener deal with noisy input (#AUTHOR_TAG and Garrod, 2007).","['Disambiguation also involves projection into the future.', 'Through theory of mind, listeners can create an emulation of what a speaker has just said, and use this to predict upcoming words, meanings, and even grammatical categories.', 'This can not only disambiguate upcoming utterances, but also facilitate rapid comprehension and help the listener deal with noisy input (#AUTHOR_TAG and Garrod, 2007).', 'In these respects, then, language draws on both theory of mind and mental time travel.']",2,"['This can not only disambiguate upcoming utterances, but also facilitate rapid comprehension and help the listener deal with noisy input (#AUTHOR_TAG and Garrod, 2007).']"

Hippocampal place cells have been proposed to have a role in navigational planning, but direct evidence has been lacking. Here we show that before goal-directed navigation in an open arena, the rat hippocampus generates brief sequences encoding spatial trajectories strongly biased to progress from the subject's current location to a known goal location. These sequences predict immediate future behaviour, even in cases in which the specific combination of start and goal locations is novel. These results indicate that hippocampal sequence events characterized previously in linearly constrained environments as 'replay' are also capable of supporting a goal-directed, trajectory-finding mechanism, which identifies important places and relevant behavioural paths, at specific times when memory retrieval is required, and in a manner that could be used to control subsequent navigational behaviour.","Sharpwave ripples pre-played these routes prior to the animal actually setting out (#AUTHOR_TAG and Foster, 2013).","['A similar conclusion is suggested by a more recent study in which rats were given experience with 36 locations in an openfield environment, and learned that a particular goal location contained a reward.', 'When located in randomly chosen locations, the rats were able to determine routes leading back to the goal, even though these routes had not been previously traversed.', 'Sharpwave ripples pre-played these routes prior to the animal actually setting out (#AUTHOR_TAG and Foster, 2013).', 'The authors suggest that the hippocampus ""function in multiple conceptual contexts: as a cognitive map in which routes to goals might be explored flexibly before behavior, as an episodic memory system engaging in what has been termed \'mental time travel\' . . .', '"" (p.', '5).']",2,"['A similar conclusion is suggested by a more recent study in which rats were given experience with 36 locations in an openfield environment, and learned that a particular goal location contained a reward.', 'When located in randomly chosen locations, the rats were able to determine routes leading back to the goal, even though these routes had not been previously traversed.', 'Sharpwave ripples pre-played these routes prior to the animal actually setting out (#AUTHOR_TAG and Foster, 2013).', 'The authors suggest that the hippocampus ""function in multiple conceptual contexts: as a cognitive map in which routes to goals might be explored flexibly before behavior, as an episodic memory system engaging in what has been termed \'mental time travel\' . . .', '"" (p.', '5).']"

Until the 1960s, many researchers questioned whether avian subjects could form categorical constructs, much less more abstract formulations, including concepts such as same-different or exact understanding of number. Although ethologists argued that nonhumans, including birds, had to have some understanding of divisions such as prey versus predator, mate versus nonmate, food versus nonfood, or basic relational concepts such as more versus less, simply in order to survive, no claims were made that these abilities reflected cognitive processes, and little formal data from psychology laboratories could initially support such claims. Researchers like Anthony Wright, however, succeeded in obtaining such data and inspired many others to pursue these topics, with the eventual result that several avian species are now considered ""feathered primates"" in terms of cognitive processes. Here I review research on numerical concepts in the Gray parrot (Psittacus erithacus), demonstrating that at least one subject, Alex, understood number symbols as abstract representations of real-world collections, in ways comparing favorably to those of apes and young human children.

Identical initial conditions triggered a similar assembly sequence, whereas different conditions gave rise to different sequences, thereby predicting behavioral choices, including errors.

Although recent studies on great ape and corvid cognition challenge this belief, the phylogenesis of human planning remains largely unknown. The complex skill for future planning has not yet been satisfactorily established in any other extant primate species than our own. In humans, planning for future needs rely heavily on two overarching capacities, both of which lie at the heart of our cognition: self-control, often defined as the suppression of immediate drives in favor of delayed rewards, and mental time travel, which could be described as a detached mental experience of a past or future event. Future planning is linked to additional high complexity cognition such as metacognition and a consciousness usually not attributed to animals. In a series of four experiments based on tool use, we demonstrate that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and orangutans (Pongo abelii) override immediate drives in favor of future needs, and they do not merely rely on associative learning or semantic prospection when confronted with a planning task. These results suggest that great apes engage in planning for the future by out competing current drives and mentally pre-experiencing an upcoming event. This suggests that the advanced mental capacities utilized in human future planning are shared by phylogenetically more ancient species than previously believed.","Chimpanzees have been shown to select tools for future use (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2008) or to collect and conceal stones to be later thrown at visitors to the zoo (Osvath, 2011).","['He said ""What\'s time?', 'Now is for dogs and apes!', 'Man has Forever!"" -Robert Browning, A grammarian\'s funeral Extending Tulving\'s conjecture, Suddendorf andCorballis (1997, 2007) suggested that mental time travel, like episodic memory, is uniquely human.', 'This suggestion, though, has proven contentious.', 'A serious challenge has come from studies of a number of non-human species, including birds.', 'For instance, scrub jays can recover cached food on the basis not only of where it was cached, but also of when it was cached, which might be taken to imply episodic memory of the caching episode itself (e.g., Clayton et al., 2003).', 'Jays also appear to select food to cache based not on present hunger, but on the basis of what they expect to have access to on the following day (Correia et al., 2007).', 'Chimpanzees have been shown to select tools for future use (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2008) or to collect and conceal stones to be later thrown at visitors to the zoo (Osvath, 2011).', 'In these and other studies there are methodological issues, and questions as to whether the results can be interpreted in terms of associative learning rather than the imagining of past or future events (see Suddendorf and Corballis, for a critique).', 'One problem in documenting mental time travel in nonhuman species is their lack of language.', 'In humans, we have immediate evidence for both episodic memory and future thinking by simply asking for verbal report.', 'Indeed, language itself may have evolved precisely to allow communication about the non-present (Corballis, 2009;G�_rdenfors and Osvath, 2010), so we can share our mental travels to other places and other times.', 'The absence of articulate language in non-human species may therefore be considered evidence of incapacity for mental time travel itself.', 'Recent evidence from neurophysiology, though, suggests that non-human animals may indeed have the capacity for at least limited mental time travel, even though they do not have the means to communicate it.', 'A default mode network homologous to that in humans has been identified in the monkey (Vincent et al., 2007), and does suggest a basis for mind wandering, if not for mental time travel itself.', 'More critical, though, may be the hippocampus, which performs two important roles in mammals, as well as in birds.']",2,"['Chimpanzees have been shown to select tools for future use (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2008) or to collect and conceal stones to be later thrown at visitors to the zoo (Osvath, 2011).']"

Most striking of all in this context is the abrupt appearance and proliferation of various forms of perforated animal teeth, shells, beads, and other personal ornaments, and the even more dramatic eruption of remarkably varied and sophisticated forms of art, ranging from representations of male and female sex organs, through the highly stylized animal and combined animal-human figures from southern Germany, to the striking wall paintings of the Chauvet Cave. 8 , 15-18 One might add to this the similar proliferation of more enigmatic but potentially equally significant abstract ""notation"" systems on bone and ivory artifacts. 19 To describe the Upper Paleolithic revolution in Europe as reflecting preeminently an explosion in explicitly symbolic behavior and expression is in no sense an exaggeration, as most prehistorians would now agree.

L. Schacter"", ""M. C. Corballis"", ""D. R. Addis""]","The role of the hippocampus in imagining the future has been of considerable interest. Preferential right hippocampal engagement is observed for imagined future events relative to remembered past events, and patients with hippocampal damage are impaired when imagining detailed future events. However, some patients with hippocampal damage are not impaired at imagining, suggesting that there are conditions in which the hippocampus may not be necessary for episodic simulation. Given the known hippocampal role in memory encoding, the hippocampal activity associated with imagining may reflect the encoding of simulations rather than event construction per se. The present functional (f)MRI study investigated this possibility. Participants imagined future events in response to person, place, and object cues. A postscan cued-recall test probing memory for detail sets classified future events as either successfully encoded or not. A contrast of successfully versus unsuccessfully encoded events revealed anterior and posterior right hippocampal clusters. When imagined events were successfully encoded, both anterior and posterior hippocampus showed common functional connectivity to a network including parahippocampal gyrus, medial parietal and cingulate cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. However, when encoding was unsuccessful, only the anterior hippocampus, and not the posterior, exhibited this pattern of connectivity. These findings demonstrate that right hippocampal activity observed during future simulation may reflect the encoding of the simulations into memory. This function is not essential for constructing coherent scenarios and may explain why some patients with hippocampal damage are still able to imagine the future.","There is some differentiation along the long axis of the hippocampus, with the posterior hippocampus more involved in storage and the retrieval of past episodes and the anterior hippocampus more activated by the imagining of future ones (Szpunar et al., 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).","['Second, the hippocampus appears to be critically involved in declarative memory systems and, in humans at least, in mental time travel generally.', 'Loss of hippocampal function in humans results in severe amnesia, including an apparent inability to imagine possible future events as well as failure to recall past ones (Hassabis et al., 2007a,b;Andelman et al., 2010;Race et al., 2011).', 'Conversely, the hippocampus is activated in neurologically intact individuals when they bring to mind past episodes and imagine possible ones As suggested earlier, the hippocampus appears to be the hub of the system, drawing detailed information from other regions of the brain, including the default-mode network (Addis et al., 2007), for the reconstruction of past or future events.', 'There is some differentiation along the long axis of the hippocampus, with the posterior hippocampus more involved in storage and the retrieval of past episodes and the anterior hippocampus more activated by the imagining of future ones (Szpunar et al., 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).']",2,"['There is some differentiation along the long axis of the hippocampus, with the posterior hippocampus more involved in storage and the retrieval of past episodes and the anterior hippocampus more activated by the imagining of future ones (Szpunar et al., 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).']"

Maguire"", ""Katherine Woollett"", ""Hugo J.

Gray matter volume differences in the hippocampus relative to controls have been reported to accompany this expertise. While these gray matter differences could result from using and updating spatial representations, they might instead be influenced by factors such as self-motion, driving experience, and stress. We examined the contribution of these factors by comparing London taxi drivers with London bus drivers, who were matched for driving experience and levels of stress, but differed in that they follow a constrained set of routes. We found that compared with bus drivers, taxi drivers had greater gray matter volume in mid-posterior hippocampi and less volume in anterior hippocampi. Furthermore, years of navigation experience correlated with hippocampal gray matter volume only in taxi drivers, with right posterior gray matter volume increasing and anterior volume decreasing with more navigation experience. This suggests that spatial knowledge, and not stress, driving, or self-motion, is associated with the pattern of hippocampal gray matter volume in taxi drivers. We then tested for functional differences between the groups and found that the ability to acquire new visuo-spatial information was worse in taxi drivers than in bus drivers. We speculate that a complex spatial representation, which facilitates expert navigation and is associated with greater posterior hippocampal gray matter volume, might come at a cost to new spatial memories and gray matter volume in the anterior hippocampus.(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","The taxi drivers also have larger hippocampi than do London bus drivers, who drive on designated routes that impose relatively small demands on memory (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2006).","['First, the hippocampus contains so-called ""place cells"" that encode where an animal is located in space, and so constitute what O\' Keefe and Nadel (1978) called a ""cognitive map.""', 'This role appears to apply to humans as well as to other mammalian species (Maguire et al., 1998).', 'For example, London taxi drivers, who are required to memorize the streets of London in sufficient detail to navigate without referring to a map or GPS, have enlarged hippocampi relative to controls-although not all trainees manage to finish the course and these show no structural change (Woollett and Maguire, 2011).', 'The taxi drivers also have larger hippocampi than do London bus drivers, who drive on designated routes that impose relatively small demands on memory (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2006).', 'Similarly, birds that cache items of food in multiple locations, and later retrieve them, have larger hippocampi than birds that do not cache (Macphail, 2002).']",0,"['The taxi drivers also have larger hippocampi than do London bus drivers, who drive on designated routes that impose relatively small demands on memory (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2006).']"

To determine whether or not the chimpanzee infers states of this kind, we showed an adult chimpanzee a series of videotaped scenes of a human actor struggling with a variety of problems.

Spatially separated patches of neuronal assemblies have been found to show synchronized oscillatory activity behavior and are said to be functionally connected. One of the most robust of these is the default mode network, which is associated with intrinsic processes like mind wandering and self-projection. Furthermore, activity in this network is anticorrelated with activity in a network that is linked to attention to external stimuli. The integrity of both networks is disturbed in altered states of consciousness, like sleep, general anesthesia and hypnosis. In coma and related disorders of consciousness, encompassing the vegetative state (unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) and minimally conscious state, default mode network integrity correlates with the level of remaining consciousness, offering the possibility of using this information for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.

Damage to the avian hippocampus disrupts performance in laboratory tasks that tap spatial learning and memory, and also disrupts both pigeon homing and cache recovery by food-storing birds. Further evidence of hippocampal involvement in food-storing is provided by the fact that the hippocampus of food-storing birds is selectively enlarged. These findings lend support to the notion that the hippocampus plays a critical role in spatial learning and memory. However, avian hippocampal lesions (like mammalian hippocampal lesions) also disrupt certain laboratory tasks that do not have an overt spatial component. Moreover, analysis of the effects of hippocampal lesions on navigation find, first, that basic navigational processes are left intact, and second, that at least some of the disruption of homing may be caused by disruption of the associability of information derived from the sun compass - a non-spatial deficit. Finally, attempts to demonstrate that the enlarged hippocampus of food-storing birds is associated with enhanced spatial memory have failed to deliver conclusive support. The extensive parallels between effects of hippocampal lesions in birds and mammals suggest that both the spatial and the non-spatial deficits form part of a single syndrome, one that cannot readily be explained in terms of disruption of specifically spatial processes.","Similarly, birds that cache items of food in multiple locations, and later retrieve them, have larger hippocampi than birds that do not cache (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2002).","['First, the hippocampus contains so-called ""place cells"" that encode where an animal is located in space, and so constitute what O\' Keefe and Nadel (1978) called a ""cognitive map.""', 'This role appears to apply to humans as well as to other mammalian species (Maguire et al., 1998).', 'For example, London taxi drivers, who are required to memorize the streets of London in sufficient detail to navigate without referring to a map or GPS, have enlarged hippocampi relative to controls-although not all trainees manage to finish the course and these show no structural change (Woollett and Maguire, 2011).', 'The taxi drivers also have larger hippocampi than do London bus drivers, who drive on designated routes that impose relatively small demands on memory (Maguire et al., 2006).', 'Similarly, birds that cache items of food in multiple locations, and later retrieve them, have larger hippocampi than birds that do not cache (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2002).']",0,"['First, the hippocampus contains so-called ""place cells"" that encode where an animal is located in space, and so constitute what O\' Keefe and Nadel (1978) called a ""cognitive map.""', 'Similarly, birds that cache items of food in multiple locations, and later retrieve them, have larger hippocampi than birds that do not cache (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2002).']"

Matelli""]","The functional properties of neurons located in the rostral part of inferior area 6 were studied in awake, partially restrained macaque monkeys. The most interesting property of these neurons was that their firing correlated with specific goal-related motor acts rather than with single movements made by the animal. Using the motor acts as the classification criterion we subdivided the neurons into six classes, four related to distal motor acts and two related to proximal motor acts. The distal classes are: ""Grasping-with-the-hand-and-the-mouth neurons"", ""Grasping-with-the-hand neurons"", ""Holding neurons"" and ""Tearing neurons"". The proximal classes are: ""Reaching neurons"" and ""Bringing-to-the-mouth-or-to-the-body neurons"". The vast majority of the cells belonged to the distal classes. A particularly interesting aspect of distal class neurons was that the discharge of many of them depended on the way in which the hand was shaped during the motor act. Three main groups of neurons were distinguished: ""Precision grip neurons"", ""Finger prehension neurons"", ""Whole hand prehension neurons"". Almost the totality of neurons fired during motor acts performed with either hand. About 50% of the recorded neurons responded to somatosensory stimuli and about 20% to visual stimuli. Visual neurons were more difficult to trigger than the corresponding neurons located in the caudal part of inferior area 6 (area F4). They required motivationally meaningful stimuli and for some of them the size of the stimulus was also critical. In the case of distal neurons there was a relationship between the type of prehension coded by the cells and the size of the stimulus effective in triggering the neurons. It is proposed that the different classes of neurons form a vocabulary of motor acts and that this vocabulary can be assessed by somatosensory and visual stimuli.","The gestural theory was boosted with the discovery in monkeys of mirror neurons, so called because they respond both when the monkey makes a grasping movement and when it observed the same movement performed by another individual (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1988).","['The idea that language evolved from manual gestures has a long history, going back at least to Condillac (1746Condillac ( /1971 in the 18th century, and restated in modern form by Hewes (1973).', 'The gestural theory was boosted with the discovery in monkeys of mirror neurons, so called because they respond both when the monkey makes a grasping movement and when it observed the same movement performed by another individual (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1988).', 'Mirror neurons are now considered part of a more extensive mirror system, involving regions in the ventral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and superior temporal sulcus (Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2010), and in fact overlapping extensively with the default network.', 'The idea that mirror neurons may underlie the evolution of language has been elaborated by a number of authors (e.g., Corballis, 2002;Arbib, 2005;Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2008).', 'The gestural theory was also boosted by the realization that the signed languages of the deaf are true languages, with full syntactic and semantic properties, albeit based entirely on visible movements of the hands and face (Armstrong et al., 1995;Armstrong, 1999).']",0,"['The gestural theory was boosted with the discovery in monkeys of mirror neurons, so called because they respond both when the monkey makes a grasping movement and when it observed the same movement performed by another individual (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1988).']"

As new researches and experiences broaden our knowledge, changes in the approach to diagnosis and therapy have become necessary and appropriate. Recommended dosage of drugs, method and duration of administration, as well as contraindications to use, evolve over time all drugs. Over the last 2 decades, Candida species have emerged as causes of substantial morbidity and mortality in hospitalized individuals. Isolation of Candida from blood or other sterile sites, excluding the urinary tract, defines invasive candidiasis. Candida species are currently the fourth most common cause of bloodstream infections (that is, candidemia) in U.S. hospitals and occur primarily in the intensive care unit (ICU), where candidemia is recognized in up to 1% of patients and where deep-seated Candida infections are recognized in an additional 1 to 2% of patients. Despite the introduction of newer anti-Candida agents, invasive candidiasis continues to have an attributable mortality rate of 40 to 49%; excess ICU and hospital stays of 12.7 days and 15.5 days, respectively, and increased care costs. Postmortem studies suggest that death rates related to invasive candidiasis might, in fact, be higher than those described because of undiagnosed and therefore untreated infection. The diagnosis of invasive candidiasis remains challenging for both clinicians and microbiologists. Reasons for missed diagnoses include nonspecific risk factors and clinical manifestations, low sensitivity of microbiological culture techniques, and unavailability of deep tissue cultures because of risks associated with the invasive procedures used to obtain them. Thus, a substantial proportion of invasive candidiasis in patients in the ICU is assumed to be undiagnosed and untreated. Yet even when invasive candidiasis is diagnosed, culture diagnosis delays treatment for 2 to 3 days, which contributes to mortality. Interventions that do not rely on a specific diagnosis and are implemented early in the course of Candida infection (that is, empirical therapy) or before Candida infection occurs (that is, prophylaxis) might improve patient survival and may be warranted. Selective and nonselective administration of anti-Candida prophylaxis is practiced in some ICUs. Several trials have tested this, but results were limited by low statistical power and choice of outcomes. Thus, the role of anti-Candida prophylaxis for patients in the ICU remains controversial. Initiating anti-Candida therapy for patients in the ICU who have suspected infection but have not responded to antibacterial therapy (empirical therapy) is practiced in some hospitals. This practice, however, remains a subject of considerable debate. These patients are perceived to be at higher risk from invasive candidiasis and therefore are likely to benefit from empirical therapy. Nonetheless, empirical anti-Candida therapies have not been evaluated in a randomized trial and would share shortcomings that are similar to those described for prophylactic strategies. Current treatment guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) do not specify whether empirical anti-Candida therapy should be provided to immunocompetent patients. If such therapy is given, IDSA recommends that its use should be limited to patients with Candida colonization in multiple sites, patients with several other risk factors, and patients with no uncorrected causes of fever. Without data from clinical trials, determining an optimal anti-Candida strategy for patients in the ICU is challenging. Identifying such a strategy can help guide clinicians in choosing adequate therapy and may improve patient outcomes. In our study, we developed a decision analytic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of empirical anti-Candida therapy given to high-risk patients in the ICU, defined as those with altered temperature (fever or hypothermia) or unexplained hypotension despite 3 days of antibacterial therapy in the ICU","As evidence for cognitive enhancement, brain size approximately tripled during the Pleistocene (#AUTHOR_TAG and Collard, 1999).","['The critical period for the evolution of language, then, was likely to have been the Pleistocene, when the transition from a forested environment to the more open savanna placed a survival premium on social bonding and the sharing of experiences.', 'The capacity for mental time travel may have been extended to enable longer-term plans and deeper access to the past.', 'As evidence for cognitive enhancement, brain size approximately tripled during the Pleistocene (#AUTHOR_TAG and Collard, 1999).', 'These developments would have underpinned more effective communication, with the emergence of obligate bipedalism adding to the communicative power of gesture, initially by freeing the hands but also exposing the rest of the body, including the face, as communicative systems.']",0,"['As evidence for cognitive enhancement, brain size approximately tripled during the Pleistocene (#AUTHOR_TAG and Collard, 1999).']"

There is a broad agreement that there are at least two learly identifiable types of mouth patterns in sign languages: They may be derived from a spoken language or they may have formed from within the sign languages and bear no relation to the mouth movement of a spoken language. Issues of terminology in this area are still not resolved. The contributions of this book reflect several areas of particular interest with respect to mouth patterns in sign languages: The meaning of terms which is not always immediately obvious in this respect, the use of Notation systems for mouth patterns, the consistency of outhings and mouth gestures, especially in relation to the methodology used as well as situational, regional and social variation and the linguistic biography of the informant, and the status of the mouth patterns that come from spoken languages.","Explicit schemes for the phonological composition of mouth movements have been proposed for a number of European Sign languages, including Swedish, English, and Italian (#AUTHOR_TAG and Boyes-Braem, 2001).","['The switch from manual to voiced language was probably gradual, with facial gestures playing an intermediary role.', 'Signed languages include silent movements of the face as well as of the hands.', 'Facial expressions and head movements can turn an affirmative sentence into a negation, or a question.', 'Mouth gestures are especially important, and have been linked to the equivalent of phonology, especially in European signed languages.', 'Explicit schemes for the phonological composition of mouth movements have been proposed for a number of European Sign languages, including Swedish, English, and Italian (#AUTHOR_TAG and Boyes-Braem, 2001).', 'Mouth gestures can serve to disambiguate hand gestures, and as part of more general facial gestures provide the equivalent of prosody in speech (Emmorey, 2002).', 'Gestures of the face and head also accompany normal speech, including raised eyebrows, winking, down-turning the mouth, tilting or shaking the head.']",0,"['Explicit schemes for the phonological composition of mouth movements have been proposed for a number of European Sign languages, including Swedish, English, and Italian (#AUTHOR_TAG and Boyes-Braem, 2001).', 'Mouth gestures can serve to disambiguate hand gestures, and as part of more general facial gestures provide the equivalent of prosody in speech (Emmorey, 2002).']"

We suggest that memory systems differ in the degree of flexibility they offer for anticipatory behavior and put forward a corresponding taxonomy of prospection. The adaptive advantage of any memory system can only lie in what it contributes for future survival. The most flexible is episodic memory, which we suggest is part of a more general faculty of mental time travel that allows us not only to go back in time, but also to foresee, plan, and shape virtually any specific future event. We review comparative studies and find that, in spite of increased research in the area, there is as yet no convincing evidence for mental time travel in nonhuman animals. We submit that mental time travel is not an encapsulated cognitive system, but instead comprises several subsidiary mechanisms. A theater metaphor serves as an analogy for the kind of mechanisms required for effective mental time travel.

Beginning about 1980, evidence from normal subjects, amnesic patients, and experimental animals converged on the view that a fundamental distinction could be drawn between a kind of memory that is accessible to conscious recollection and another kind that is not. Subsequent work shifted thinking beyond dichotomies to a view, grounded in biology, that memory is composed of multiple separate systems supported, for example, by the hippocampus and related structures, the amygdala, the neostriatum, and the cerebellum. This article traces the development of these ideas and provides a current perspective on how these brain systems operate to support behavior.","Declarative memory, in turn, can be divided into episodic memory, which is personal memory for past episodes, and semantic memory, which is basic knowledge about the world (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2004).","['A critical component of mind wandering is memory, which provides the basic elements from which our mind wanderings are constructed.', 'Memory itself can be divided into declarative memory, which can be made explicit or conscious, and non-declarative memory, which comprises the non-conscious products of learning, such as habits or learned skills like driving or playing the piano.', 'Declarative memory, in turn, can be divided into episodic memory, which is personal memory for past episodes, and semantic memory, which is basic knowledge about the world (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2004).', 'According to Tulving (1972), episodic memory is unique to humans.']",0,"['Declarative memory, in turn, can be divided into episodic memory, which is personal memory for past episodes, and semantic memory, which is basic knowledge about the world (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2004).', 'According to Tulving (1972), episodic memory is unique to humans.']"

It has been proposed that these three self-referential processes involve a highly interconnected core set of brain structures known as the default mode network (DMN). The DMN appears to be active when individuals are engaged in stimulus-independent thought. This network is a likely candidate for supporting multiple processes, but this idea has not been tested directly. We used fMRI to examine brain activity during autobiographical remembering, prospection, and theory-of-mind reasoning. Using multivariate analyses, we found a common pattern of neural activation underlying all three processes in the DMN. In addition, autobiographical remembering and prospection engaged midline DMN structures to a greater degree and theory-of-mind reasoning engaged lateral DMN areas. A functional connectivity analysis revealed that activity of a critical node in the DMN, medial prefrontal cortex, was correlated with activity in other regions in the DMN during all three tasks. We conclude that the DMN supports common aspects of these cognitive behaviors involved in simulating an internalized experience.","What has been termed episodic foresight (Suddendorf, 2010), along with autobiographic memory and theory of mind, also makes up much of our mind wandering (#AUTHOR_TAG and Grady, 2009), as we preview some future activity or consider possible future options in order to select appropriate action.","['Memory, both episodic and semantic (Klein, 2013), provides the ingredients for imagining possible future events.', 'What has been termed episodic foresight (Suddendorf, 2010), along with autobiographic memory and theory of mind, also makes up much of our mind wandering (#AUTHOR_TAG and Grady, 2009), as we preview some future activity or consider possible future options in order to select appropriate action.', 'The capacity to mentally relive past events and imagine possible future ones comprises has been termed mental time travel (Suddendorf andCorballis, 1997, 2007), taking us into an imagined future as well as into an imagined past.', 'Both are essentially constructive processes.', 'Brain imaging shows considerable overlap in brain activation between the two, with slightly more frontal-lobe activity in imagining the future (e.g., Addis et al., 2007).', 'Critical to both is the hippocampus, whose role is discussed in more detail below.']",2,"['What has been termed episodic foresight (Suddendorf, 2010), along with autobiographic memory and theory of mind, also makes up much of our mind wandering (#AUTHOR_TAG and Grady, 2009), as we preview some future activity or consider possible future options in order to select appropriate action.']"

Russell"", ""Frank J. Cerny"", ""Elaine T. Stathopoulos""]","This study was completed to determine how ventilatory responses change by means of speech reading at three different sound pressure levels (SPL) as compared to quiet breathing prior to each task. The energy required to alter SPL was also studied and compared to energy expenditures during a quiet breathing condition. Twenty-four adults (12 women, 12 men) were studied while reading a standard passage at low, comfortable, and high SPLs for 7 minutes with quiet breathing periods between each task to achieve respiratory steady state and serve as a control to which the reading tasks were compared. The last 2 minutes of exhaled air for all speaking and quiet breathing tasks were collected using a Hans Rudolph mouth breathing face mask. A Sensor Medics Vmax 29 series diagnostic instrument system measured all ventilatory responses and energy expenditures. Volume and timing alterations in ventilation were characterized by measuring tidal volume (V[T]), inspiratory time (T[I]), inspiratory flow rate (V[T]/T[I]), and expiratory time (T[E]). Average ventilation, energy expenditure, and adequacy of ventilation were measured using minute ventilation (V[E]), oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), and partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (end-tidal PET[CO2]). Results indicated volume, timing, ventilation, and energy expenditure values remained closest to quiet breathing values for the comfortable SPL. Volume, ventilation, and energy expenditure were significantly greater for the high SPL and lower for the low SPL, compared to the baseline steady state, indicating that the low SPL causes a ventilatory deficit that was found to be paid back at the end of the speech task during the quiet breathing period. These results demonstrate that an individual's comfortable SPL is the least energy-requiring way to speech breathe. As SPL rises above or below comfortable SPL, speech breathing requires more energy.","Manual language is effortful, requiring considerable expenditure of energy, while the physiological costs of speech are so low as to be nearly unmeasurable (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1998).","['The switch from manual gesture to speech may well have been the change that led to the dominance of Homo sapiens, perhaps even leading to the demise of the other large-brained hominins, including the Neanderthals and the recently identified Denisovans.', 'Although we habitually gesture manually while speaking, manual movements can be disengaged, and play no role in communicating by phone or on radio.', 'Speech, then, may be regarded as an early example of miniaturization, tucking language output neatly into the mouth.', 'This resulted in increased energy efficiency.', 'Manual language is effortful, requiring considerable expenditure of energy, while the physiological costs of speech are so low as to be nearly unmeasurable (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1998).', 'Speech adds little to the cost of breathing, which we must do anyway to sustain life.', 'Speech also allows communication at night, or when speaker and audience are not in visual contact.', 'More importantly, perhaps, the transition to speech freed the rest of the body for other activities, including the use and manufacture of tools.', 'This compartmentalization and increase in communicative efficiency may well explain the survival and dominance of our species, whether it occurred as part of the cultural revolution or as a more gradual change over the past 200,000 years.']",2,"['Manual language is effortful, requiring considerable expenditure of energy, while the physiological costs of speech are so low as to be nearly unmeasurable (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1998).', 'Speech adds little to the cost of breathing, which we must do anyway to sustain life.']"

Brooks""]","Proponents of the model known as the ""human revolution"" claim that modern human behaviors arose suddenly, and nearly simultaneously, throughout the Old World ca. 40-50 ka. This fundamental behavioral shift is purported to signal a cognitive advance, a possible reorganization of the brain, and the origin of language. Because the earliest modern human fossils, Homo sapiens sensu stricto, are found in Africa and the adjacent region of the Levant at >100 ka, the ""human revolution"" model creates a time lag between the appearance of anatomical modernity and perceived behavioral modernity, and creates the impression that the earliest modern Africans were behaviorally primitive. This view of events stems from a profound Eurocentric bias and a failure to appreciate the depth and breadth of the African archaeological record. In fact, many of the components of the ""human revolution"" claimed to appear at 40-50 ka are found in the African Middle Stone Age tens of thousands of years earlier. These features include blade and microlithic technology, bone tools, increased geographic range, specialized hunting, the use of aquatic resources, long distance trade, systematic processing and use of pigment, and art and decoration. These items do not occur suddenly together as predicted by the ""human revolution"" model, but at sites that are widely separated in space and time. This suggests a gradual assembling of the package of modern human behaviors in Africa, and its later export to other regions of the Old World. The African Middle and early Late Pleistocene hominid fossil record is fairly continuous and in it can be recognized a number of probably distinct species that provide plausible ancestors for H. sapiens. The appearance of Middle Stone Age technology and the first signs of modern behavior coincide with the appearance of fossils that have been attributed to H. helmei, suggesting the behavior of H. helmei is distinct from that of earlier hominid species and quite similar to that of modern people. If on anatomical and behavioral grounds H. helmei is sunk into H. sapiens, the origin of our species is linked with the appearance of Middle Stone Age technology at 250-300 ka.Copyright 2000 Academic Press.","#AUTHOR_TAG and Brooks (2000) write of the ""revolution that wasn't,"" suggesting a more gradual rise in technological sophistication from the Middle Stone Age around 250,000-300,000 years ago, and Shea (2011) similarly argues that human technology over the past 200,000 years is characterized by a variability that persists today, rather than by the abrupt appearance of ""modern behavior.""","['Nevertheless, not all prehistorians are in agreement.', '#AUTHOR_TAG and Brooks (2000) write of the ""revolution that wasn\'t,"" suggesting a more gradual rise in technological sophistication from the Middle Stone Age around 250,000-300,000 years ago, and Shea (2011) similarly argues that human technology over the past 200,000 years is characterized by a variability that persists today, rather than by the abrupt appearance of ""modern behavior.""', 'Given that our species is estimated to have emerged some 200,000 years ago, it seems unlikely that there was a dramatic rewiring of the brain within the past 100,000 years.']",1,"['Nevertheless, not all prehistorians are in agreement.', '#AUTHOR_TAG and Brooks (2000) write of the ""revolution that wasn\'t,"" suggesting a more gradual rise in technological sophistication from the Middle Stone Age around 250,000-300,000 years ago, and Shea (2011) similarly argues that human technology over the past 200,000 years is characterized by a variability that persists today, rather than by the abrupt appearance of ""modern behavior.""']"

That is, one can identify a set of basic, distinct units (phonemes, syllables) that can be productively combined in many different ways. In this paper, we review a number of theories and models that have been developed to explain the evolutionary transition from holistic to combinatorial signal systems, but find that in all problematic linguistic assumptions are made, or crucial components of evolutionary explanations are omitted. We present a novel model to investigate the hypothesis that combinatorial phonology results from optimising signal systems for perceptual distinctiveness. Our model differs from previous models in two important respects. First, signals are modelled as trajectories through acoustic space. Hence, both holistic and combinatorial signals have a temporal structure. Second, we use the methodology from evolutionary game theory. Crucially, we show a path of ever increasing fitness from holistic to combinatorial signals, where every innovation represents an advantage even if no-one else in a population has yet obtained it.","Some have argued against the gestural theory on the grounds that it must have required an unlikely transition from a visuo-manual format to an auditory-vocal one (e.g., Burling, 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2012).","['One possibility is that any change in behavioral patterns in our species was the outcome, not of a rewiring of the brain, nor of the ""unimaginable transition"" declared by Tattersall (2012), but was the outcome of a change in the manner of communication.', 'I suggested above that language may have originated in manual gestures, and of course it persists in this form in the signed languages of the deaf.', 'If this scenario is correct, then, it must have switched to the vocal form that we call speech at some point.', 'Some have argued against the gestural theory on the grounds that it must have required an unlikely transition from a visuo-manual format to an auditory-vocal one (e.g., Burling, 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2012).', 'However, in my view the transition is better viewed not as a switch of modalities, but rather as a switch in gestural format.', 'In a recent analysis of the neural mechanisms of speech articulation, Bouchard et al.

Corballis""]","Language, whether spoken or signed, can be viewed as a gestural system, evolving from the so-called mirror system in the primate brain. In nonhuman primates the gestural system is well developed for the productions and perception of manual action, especially transitive acts involving the grasping of objects. The emergence of bipedalism in the hominins freed the hands for the adaptation of the mirror system for intransitive acts for communication, initially through the miming of events. With the emergence of the genus Homo from some 2 million years ago, pressures for more complex communication and increased vocabulary size led to the conventionalization of gestures, the loss of iconic representation, and a gradual shift to vocal gestures replacing manual ones--although signed languages are still composed of manual and facial gestures. In parallel with the conventionalization of symbols, languages gained grammatical complexity, perhaps driven by the evolution of episodic memory and mental time travel, which involve combinations of familiar elements--Who did what to whom, when, where, and why? Language is thus adapted to allow us to share episodic structures, whether past, planned, or fictional, and so increase survival fitness.","Indeed, language itself may have evolved precisely to allow communication about the non-present (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2009;G�_rdenfors and Osvath, 2010), so we can share our mental travels to other places and other times.","['He said ""What\'s time?', 'Now is for dogs and apes!', 'Man has Forever!"" -Robert Browning, A grammarian\'s funeral Extending Tulving\'s conjecture, Suddendorf andCorballis (1997, 2007) suggested that mental time travel, like episodic memory, is uniquely human.', 'This suggestion, though, has proven contentious.', 'A serious challenge has come from studies of a number of non-human species, including birds.', 'For instance, scrub jays can recover cached food on the basis not only of where it was cached, but also of when it was cached, which might be taken to imply episodic memory of the caching episode itself (e.g., Clayton et al., 2003).', 'Jays also appear to select food to cache based not on present hunger, but on the basis of what they expect to have access to on the following day (Correia et al., 2007).', 'Chimpanzees have been shown to select tools for future use (Osvath and Osvath, 2008) or to collect and conceal stones to be later thrown at visitors to the zoo (Osvath, 2011).', 'In these and other studies there are methodological issues, and questions as to whether the results can be interpreted in terms of associative learning rather than the imagining of past or future events (see Suddendorf and Corballis, for a critique).', 'One problem in documenting mental time travel in nonhuman species is their lack of language.', 'In humans, we have immediate evidence for both episodic memory and future thinking by simply asking for verbal report.', 'Indeed, language itself may have evolved precisely to allow communication about the non-present (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2009;G�_rdenfors and Osvath, 2010), so we can share our mental travels to other places and other times.', 'The absence of articulate language in non-human species may therefore be considered evidence of incapacity for mental time travel itself.', 'Recent evidence from neurophysiology, though, suggests that non-human animals may indeed have the capacity for at least limited mental time travel, even though they do not have the means to communicate it.', 'A default mode network homologous to that in humans has been identified in the monkey (Vincent et al., 2007), and does suggest a basis for mind wandering, if not for mental time travel itself.', 'More critical, though, may be the hippocampus, which performs two important roles in mammals, as well as in birds.']",2,"['Indeed, language itself may have evolved precisely to allow communication about the non-present (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2009;G�_rdenfors and Osvath, 2010), so we can share our mental travels to other places and other times.']"

It reviews a broad range of data, including studies of language and communicative abilities in apes, the skeletal remains and artefacts in the archaeological record, and the language abilities of hearing, deaf, and language-impaired human populations. Whereas nonhuman primates tend to gesture only when others are looking, their vocalisations are not necessarily directed at others Ñ perhaps because of differences in voluntary control over gestures and vocalisations. One of the first steps in language evolution may have been the advent of bipedalism, which would have allowed the hands to be used for gestures instead of locomotion. There could have been a gradual evolution of a capacity for grammar, although language remained primarily gestural until relatively late in our evolutionary history. The shift from visual gestures to vocal ones would have been gradual, and largely autonomous speech likely arose following a genetic mutation between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago.","The idea that mirror neurons may underlie the evolution of language has been elaborated by a number of authors (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG, 2002;Arbib, 2005;Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2008).","['The idea that language evolved from manual gestures has a long history, going back at least to Condillac (1746Condillac ( /1971 in the 18th century, and restated in modern form by Hewes (1973).', 'The gestural theory was boosted with the discovery in monkeys of mirror neurons, so called because they respond both when the monkey makes a grasping movement and when it observed the same movement performed by another individual (Rizzolatti et al., 1988).', 'Mirror neurons are now considered part of a more extensive mirror system, involving regions in the ventral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and superior temporal sulcus (Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2010), and in fact overlapping extensively with the default network.', 'The idea that mirror neurons may underlie the evolution of language has been elaborated by a number of authors (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG, 2002;Arbib, 2005;Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2008).', 'The gestural theory was also boosted by the realization that the signed languages of the deaf are true languages, with full syntactic and semantic properties, albeit based entirely on visible movements of the hands and face (Armstrong et al., 1995;Armstrong, 1999).']",2,"['The idea that language evolved from manual gestures has a long history, going back at least to Condillac (1746Condillac ( /1971 in the 18th century, and restated in modern form by Hewes (1973).', 'The idea that mirror neurons may underlie the evolution of language has been elaborated by a number of authors (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG, 2002;Arbib, 2005;Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2008).']"

Here we synthesize past observations to provide strong evidence that the default network is a specific, anatomically defined brain system preferentially active when individuals are not focused on the external environment. Analysis of connectional anatomy in the monkey supports the presence of an interconnected brain system. Providing insight into function, the default network is active when individuals are engaged in internally focused tasks including autobiographical memory retrieval, envisioning the future, and conceiving the perspectives of others. Probing the functional anatomy of the network in detail reveals that it is best understood as multiple interacting subsystems. The medial temporal lobe subsystem provides information from prior experiences in the form of memories and associations that are the building blocks of mental simulation. The medial prefrontal subsystem facilitates the flexible use of this information during the construction of self-relevant mental simulations. These two subsystems converge on important nodes of integration including the posterior cingulate cortex. The implications of these functional and anatomical observations are discussed in relation to possible adaptive roles of the default network for using past experiences to plan for the future, navigate social interactions, and maximize the utility of moments when we are not otherwise engaged by the external world.

Brian Boyd explains why we tell stories, how our minds are shaped to understand them, and what difference an evolutionary understanding of human nature makes to stories we love. Art is a specifically human adaptation, Boyd argues. It offers tangible advantages for human survival, and it derives from play, itself an adaptation widespread among more intelligent animals. More particularly, our fondness for storytelling has sharpened social cognition, encouraged cooperation, and fostered creativity. After considering art as adaptation, Boyd examines HomerÕs Odyssey and Dr. SeussÕs Horton Hears a Who! demonstrating how an evolutionary lens can offer new understanding and appreciation of specific works. What triggers our emotional engagement with these works? What patterns facilitate our responses? The need to hold an audienceÕs attention, Boyd underscores, is the fundamental problem facing all storytellers. Enduring artists arrive at solutions that appeal to cognitive universals: an insight out of step with contemporary criticism, which obscures both the individual and universal. Published for the bicentenary of DarwinÕs birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of Origin of Species, BoydÕs study embraces a Darwinian view of human nature and art, and offers a credo for a new humanism.","#AUTHOR_TAG (2009) points out that religious ideas derive their power less from doctrine than from stories, and stories told orally were passed down the generations with remarkable fidelity before the invention of writing.","['The emergence of speech as the dominant mode may well have enhanced story-telling, and the sharing of cultural myths and legends that do much to bind societies together.', '#AUTHOR_TAG (2009) points out that religious ideas derive their power less from doctrine than from stories, and stories told orally were passed down the generations with remarkable fidelity before the invention of writing.', 'But the invention of writing has also had a profound effect on human culture, as have more recent inventions such as the Internet and cellphone.', 'The story of human progress may well be in large part the story of advances in communication, and the switch from gestural to vocal communication was an early example.', 'The switch, moreover, may have been more a blend from one to the other, and is still arguably incomplete-especially in Italy.']",2,"['#AUTHOR_TAG (2009) points out that religious ideas derive their power less from doctrine than from stories, and stories told orally were passed down the generations with remarkable fidelity before the invention of writing.']"

Bouchard"", ""Nima Mesgarani"", ""Keith Johnson"", ""Edward F. Chang""]","Speaking is one of the most complex actions that we perform, but nearly all of us learn to do it effortlessly. Production of fluent speech requires the precise, coordinated movement of multiple articulators (for example, the lips, jaw, tongue and larynx) over rapid time scales. Here we used high-resolution, multi-electrode cortical recordings during the production of consonant-vowel syllables to determine the organization of speech sensorimotor cortex in humans. We found speech-articulator representations that are arranged somatotopically on ventral pre- and post-central gyri, and that partially overlap at individual electrodes. These representations were coordinated temporally as sequences during syllable production. Spatial patterns of cortical activity showed an emergent, population-level representation, which was organized by phonetic features. Over tens of milliseconds, the spatial patterns transitioned between distinct representations for different consonants and vowels. These results reveal the dynamic organization of speech sensorimotor cortex during the generation of multi-articulator movements that underlies our ability to speak","In a recent analysis of the neural mechanisms of speech articulation, #AUTHOR_TAG et al.

CC2988,82867364,Wandering tales: evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language,Michael Corballis,Speech and gesture share the same communication system,"[""Paolo Bernardis"", ""Maurizio Gentilucci""]","Humans speak and produce symbolic gestures. Do these two forms of communication interact, and how? First, we tested whether the two communication signals influenced each other when emitted simultaneously. Participants either pronounced words, or executed symbolic gestures, or emitted the two communication signals simultaneously. Relative to the unimodal conditions, multimodal voice spectra were enhanced by gestures, whereas multimodal gesture parameters were reduced by words. In other words, gesture reinforced word, whereas word inhibited gesture. In contrast, aimless arm movements and pseudo-words had no comparable effects. Next, we tested whether observing word pronunciation during gesture execution affected verbal responses in the same way as emitting the two signals. Participants responded verbally to either spoken words, or to gestures, or to the simultaneous presentation of the two signals. We observed the same reinforcement in the voice spectra as during simultaneous emission. These results suggest that spoken word and symbolic gesture are coded as single signal by a unique communication system. This signal represents the intention to engage a closer interaction with a hypothetical interlocutor and it may have a meaning different from when word and gesture are encoded singly.","The transition was probably not a dramatic one, since movements of the hand and mouth are coordinated in activities such as eating, and hand movements and mouth movements mutually interact (#AUTHOR_TAG and Gentilucci, 2006;Gentilucci and Corballis, 2006).","['The transition was probably not a dramatic one, since movements of the hand and mouth are coordinated in activities such as eating, and hand movements and mouth movements mutually interact (#AUTHOR_TAG and Gentilucci, 2006;Gentilucci and Corballis, 2006).', 'The introduction of voicing to the gestural repertoire probably also involved modification of neural mechanisms, including a direct connection between the motor cortex and the nucleus ambiguus (a midbrain vocalization center) that seems to be unique to humans (J�_rgens, 2002), and that may explain why vocalization is under precise voluntary control in humans but not in chimpanzees.', 'The continuing link between speech and gesture is further illustrated by the fact that people habitually gesture with their hands as they speak.', 'Moreover gestures are in strict synchrony with speaking, implying a common underlying source (McNeill, 1985).']",0,"['The transition was probably not a dramatic one, since movements of the hand and mouth are coordinated in activities such as eating, and hand movements and mouth movements mutually interact (#AUTHOR_TAG and Gentilucci, 2006;Gentilucci and Corballis, 2006).']"

The authors argue that manual and vocal communication developed in parallel, and that the basic elements of syntax are intrinsic to gesture. They draw on evidence from areas such as primatology, anthropology, and linguistics, to present a groundbreaking account of the notion that language emerged through visible bodily action. They go on to examine the implications of their findings for linguistic theory and theories of the biological evolution of the capacity for language. Written in a clear and accessible style, Gesture and the Nature of Language will be indispensable reading for all those interested in the origins of language.","The gestural theory was also boosted by the realization that the signed languages of the deaf are true languages, with full syntactic and semantic properties, albeit based entirely on visible movements of the hands and face (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1995;Armstrong, 1999).","['The idea that language evolved from manual gestures has a long history, going back at least to Condillac (1746Condillac ( /1971 in the 18th century, and restated in modern form by Hewes (1973).', 'The gestural theory was boosted with the discovery in monkeys of mirror neurons, so called because they respond both when the monkey makes a grasping movement and when it observed the same movement performed by another individual (Rizzolatti et al., 1988).', 'Mirror neurons are now considered part of a more extensive mirror system, involving regions in the ventral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and superior temporal sulcus (Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2010), and in fact overlapping extensively with the default network.', 'The idea that mirror neurons may underlie the evolution of language has been elaborated by a number of authors (e.g., Corballis, 2002;Arbib, 2005;Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2008).', 'The gestural theory was also boosted by the realization that the signed languages of the deaf are true languages, with full syntactic and semantic properties, albeit based entirely on visible movements of the hands and face (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1995;Armstrong, 1999).']",2,"['The idea that language evolved from manual gestures has a long history, going back at least to Condillac (1746Condillac ( /1971 in the 18th century, and restated in modern form by Hewes (1973).', 'The gestural theory was also boosted by the realization that the signed languages of the deaf are true languages, with full syntactic and semantic properties, albeit based entirely on visible movements of the hands and face (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1995;Armstrong, 1999).']"
CC2990,82867364,Wandering tales: evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language,Michael Corballis,From monkey-like action recognition to human language: An evolutionary framework for neurolinguistics,"[""Michael A. Arbib""]","The article analyzes the neural and functional grounding of language skills as well as their emergence in hominid evolution, hypothesizing stages leading from abilities known to exist in monkeys and apes and presumed to exist in our hominid ancestors right through to modern spoken and signed languages. The starting point is the observation that both premotor area F5 in monkeys and Broca's area in humans contain a ""mirror system"" active for both execution and observation of manual actions, and that F5 and Broca's area are homologous brain regions. This grounded the mirror system hypothesis of Rizzolatti and Arbib (1998) which offers the mirror system for grasping as a key neural ""missing link"" between the abilities of our nonhuman ancestors of 20 million years ago and modern human language, with manual gestures rather than a system for vocal communication providing the initial seed for this evolutionary process. The present article, however, goes ""beyond the mirror"" to offer hypotheses on evolutionary changes within and outside the mirror systems which may have occurred to equip Homo sapiens with a language-ready brain. Crucial to the early stages of this progression is the mirror system for grasping and its extension to permit imitation. Imitation is seen as evolving via a so-called simple system such as that found in chimpanzees (which allows imitation of complex ""object-oriented"" sequences but only as the result of extensive practice) to a so-called complex system found in humans (which allows rapid imitation even of complex sequences, under appropriate conditions) which supports pantomime. This is hypothesized to have provided the substrate for the development of protosign, a combinatorially open repertoire of manual gestures, which then provides the scaffolding for the emergence of protospeech (which thus owes little to nonhuman vocalizations), with protosign and protospeech then developing in an expanding spiral. It is argued that these stages involve biological evolution of both brain and body. By contrast, it is argued that the progression from protosign and protospeech to languages with full-blown syntax and compositional semantics was a historical phenomenon in the development of Homo sapiens, involving few if any further biological changes.","The idea that mirror neurons may underlie the evolution of language has been elaborated by a number of authors (e.g., Corballis, 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2005;Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2008).","['The idea that language evolved from manual gestures has a long history, going back at least to Condillac (1746Condillac ( /1971 in the 18th century, and restated in modern form by Hewes (1973).', 'The gestural theory was boosted with the discovery in monkeys of mirror neurons, so called because they respond both when the monkey makes a grasping movement and when it observed the same movement performed by another individual (Rizzolatti et al., 1988).', 'Mirror neurons are now considered part of a more extensive mirror system, involving regions in the ventral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and superior temporal sulcus (Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2010), and in fact overlapping extensively with the default network.', 'The idea that mirror neurons may underlie the evolution of language has been elaborated by a number of authors (e.g., Corballis, 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2005;Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2008).', 'The gestural theory was also boosted by the realization that the signed languages of the deaf are true languages, with full syntactic and semantic properties, albeit based entirely on visible movements of the hands and face (Armstrong et al., 1995;Armstrong, 1999).']",2,"['The idea that language evolved from manual gestures has a long history, going back at least to Condillac (1746Condillac ( /1971 in the 18th century, and restated in modern form by Hewes (1973).', 'The gestural theory was boosted with the discovery in monkeys of mirror neurons, so called because they respond both when the monkey makes a grasping movement and when it observed the same movement performed by another individual (Rizzolatti et al., 1988).', 'The idea that mirror neurons may underlie the evolution of language has been elaborated by a number of authors (e.g., Corballis, 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2005;Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2008).']"

This was at the time when Vienna became the permanent residence of the Holy Roman Empire (except from 1583 to 1611 when it was moved to Prague), due to the Habsburgs holding the crown. Vienna was also the capital of the so-called Danube Monarchy, which came into being in the early sixteenth century.

These substantially influenced fluvial dynamics and enabled urban development in parts of the former floodplain.

Hohensinner"", ""M. Jungwirth"", ""S. Muhar"", ""S. Schmutz""]","Modern, holistic concepts dealing with river/floodplain ecology recognize the key role of hydromorphological turnover processes for the development of distinct habitat patterns. Such patterns, in turn, are a vital basis for the extraordinary biodiversity of riverine systems. Natural braided/anabranched river systems in particular are characterised by high turnover rates; in the mid-term, however, they are thought to stay in dynamic equilibrium (shifting-mosaic steady-state) as long as the physical framework conditions remain unchanged. This study analyses both the historical composition and the spatio-temporal development of riverine habitats associated with an anabranched section of the Austrian Danube River. A habitat age model was used to analyse the age structure of the different habitat types. The results for the period 1812-1821 prior to channelization indicate that terrestrialization and habitat ageing were almost balanced with habitat regeneration and rejuvenation. Even though intensive morphological changes occurred, the Danube here largely persisted in dynamic equilibrium. The first channelization measures between 1821 and 1838, when 21% of the main channel banks were embanked, slightly promoted habitat regeneration. From 1859 onwards (80% embanked) until 1925, the natural habitat life time cycle was disrupted and the regenerating processes almost ceased. Altogether, human interferences led to a river landscape in a morphologically static state governed by significant terrestrialization (habitat succession) and habitat ageing. Without natural disturbances or, alternatively, targeted habitat management strategies, such an ecosystem soon lacks morphologically young habitats and adequate site conditions for a river/floodplain type-specific biocoenosis.

NANSON"", ""A. DAVID KNIGHTON""]","Anabranching rivers consist of multiple channels separated by vegetated semi-permanent alluvial islands excised from existing floodplain or formed by within-channel or deltaic accretion. These rivers occupy a wide range of environments from low to high energy, however, their existence has never been adequately explained. They occur concurrently with other types of channel pattern, although specific requirements include a flood-dominated flow regime and banks that are resistant to erosion, with some systems characterized by mechanisms to block or constrict channels, thereby triggering avulsion. The fundamental advantage of an anabranching river is that, by constructing a semi-permanent system of multiple channels, it can concentrate stream flow and maximize bed-sediment transport (work per unit area of the bed) under conditions where there is little or no opportunity to increase gradient. On the basis of stream energy, sediment size and morphological characteristics, six types of anabranching river are recognized; types 1Ð3 are lower energy and types 4Ð6 are higher energy systems. Type 1 are cohesive sediment rivers (commonly termed anastomosing) with low w/d ratio channels that exhibit little or no lateral migration. They are divisible into three subtypes based on vegetative and sedimentary environment. Type 2 are sand-dominated, island-forming rivers, and type 3 are mixed-load laterally active meandering rivers. Type 4 are sand-dominated, ridge-forming rivers characterized by long, parallel, channel-dividing ridges. Type 5 are gravel-dominated, laterally active systems that interface between meandering and braiding in mountainous regions.

Individual channels in an avulsive system display one of the conventional pattern types (e.g. meandering, braiding), but these patterns may reflect the behavioural relationships between the ÔdominantÕ and ÔsecondaryÕ channels in the system. These relationships change through time as aggradation along the dominant channel encourages avulsion into the course of former secondary channels, and the channels exchange roles. Thus, channel system behaviour is not explained by the variation of stream power used to analyse the behaviour of individual (meandering or braided) rivers, and palaeohydrological reconstructions for individual channels within such a system are of limited significance. Examples of avulsive systems are noted, including the northern Gangetic Plain.","Due to the high bed shear stress, new channels incised into the floodplain terrain (first order avulsion) or led to the reoccupation of abandoned arms or crevasse channels (second order avulsion; #AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1993).","['In Vienna, summer and autumn floods after heavy rainfalls in the upper catchment, thaw floods in spring and the very typical ice jam floods in winter were the main reasons of sudden channel changes.', 'This was especially true when ice jams suddenly disintegrated.', 'Due to the high bed shear stress, new channels incised into the floodplain terrain (first order avulsion) or led to the reoccupation of abandoned arms or crevasse channels (second order avulsion; #AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1993).', 'At side arms, large woody debris-originally a typical phenomenon with the unregulated Danube-had similar consequences.', ""It is plausible that centuries of timber harvesting in the floodplains anthropogenically reduced the development of large woody debris compared to hypothetical 'natural' conditions."", 'Besides channel changes caused by severe floods, flows between mean water and bankfull water level (approx.', '1-year flood) contributed to lateral channel migration, which could amount to an average of 25 m per year at cut banks (Hohensinner, unpublished).', 'Since some side arms developed into meander bends, meander cut-offs also occurred; this led to the accretion of the abandoned channel.']",0,"['Due to the high bed shear stress, new channels incised into the floodplain terrain (first order avulsion) or led to the reoccupation of abandoned arms or crevasse channels (second order avulsion; #AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1993).', 'At side arms, large woody debris-originally a typical phenomenon with the unregulated Danube-had similar consequences.']"

Foresman"", ""Steward T. A. Pickett"", ""Wayne C.

This paper presents three principal methods: (1) core analysis; (2) historic mapping; and (3) gradient analysis, to link spatial and temporal data for urban ecosystems and applies their use in the Baltimore-Chesapeake region. Paleoecological evidence derived from the geochronology of sediment cores provides data on long-term as well as recent changes in vegetative land cover. This information, combined with contemporary vegetation maps, provides a baseline for conducting trend analyses to evaluate urbanization of the landscape. A 200-year historical land use database created from historical maps, census data, and remotely sensed data provides a spatial framework for investigating human impacts on the region. A geographic information system (GIS) integrates core analyses with historic data on land use change to yield a comprehensive land use and land cover framework and rates of change. These data resources establish the regional foundation for investigating the ecological components of an urban ecosystem. Urban-rural gradient analyses and patch analyses are proposed as the most appropriate methods for studying the urban ecosystem as they link ecological and social patterns and processes for varying degrees of urbanization.","These include, amongst others, the Baltimore-Chesapeake region (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1997), the American Great Plains (Cunfer 2008), the Rocky Mountains (Aspinall 2004), Southern Germany (Bender et al. 2005;Schuppert and Dix 2009), the Tisza River in Hungary (Hegedüs and Duray 2009) and several Austrian villages and rivers (Forschungsinitiative Umweltgeschichte 1999;Haidvogl 2008).","['Reconstructing riverscapes over decades or even centuries better approximates the former situations than the reconstruction of a single point in time.', 'In recent years, GISbased studies of historical fluvial morphology were conducted over the long term to reveal the causes of past channel changes and floodplain degradation (Gurnell et al. 1994(Gurnell et al. , 2005Marston et al. 1995;Kiss et al. 2008).', 'Some historical studies specifically focus on the spatial distribution of riverine habitats and the land cover of riverscapes.', 'In Europe, such investigations were conducted on several French rivers (e.g.', 'Girel et al. 1997;Kondolf et al. 2007), the current Slovak Danube (Pisút 2002), the lower Rhine (Schoor et al. 1999;Wolfert 2001), the Dyje River, Czech Republic (Skokanova 2008) and on several English rivers (Lewin 2010).', 'Outside Europe, comparable studies exist for e.g. the upper Mississippi (de Jager et al. 2011) and the Sacramento River, California (Greco et al. 2007).', 'In ecology and environmental history alike, GIS techniques have often been deployed to reconstruct past land cover and land use changes based on historical maps such as cadastral maps.', 'These include, amongst others, the Baltimore-Chesapeake region (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1997), the American Great Plains (Cunfer 2008), the Rocky Mountains (Aspinall 2004), Southern Germany (Bender et al. 2005;Schuppert and Dix 2009), the Tisza River in Hungary (Hegedüs and Duray 2009) and several Austrian villages and rivers (Forschungsinitiative Umweltgeschichte 1999;Haidvogl 2008).', 'Knowles (2002) has already demonstrated the potential of GIS techniques for historical research.']",0,"['These include, amongst others, the Baltimore-Chesapeake region (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1997), the American Great Plains (Cunfer 2008), the Rocky Mountains (Aspinall 2004), Southern Germany (Bender et al. 2005;Schuppert and Dix 2009), the Tisza River in Hungary (Hegedüs and Duray 2009) and several Austrian villages and rivers (Forschungsinitiative Umweltgeschichte 1999;Haidvogl 2008).']"

M. Gurnell"", ""S. R. Downward"", ""R.

The information on river planform change spans the last 115 years, during which time the river has been subject to increasing flow regulation, which may have affected its planform. The downstream location of the reach provides two additional factors which may have an impact on the nature and rate of planform change through their influence on energy conditions in the reach: a tidal backwater influence on the downstream section of the reach; and a low angle of slope. The reach has shown very small changes in planform over the last 115 years, which have been successfully identified by a geographical information system (GIS)-based data handling methodology, which not only allows the estimation of a variety of indices of change, but also supports the estimation of the potential errors associated with registering the historical sources to a common base and digitizing the channel boundary locations. The study is successful in identifying channel planform change because it has utilized a GIS-based as opposed to a manual approach, but it represents the lower limit to which bank movement can be confidently identified in a low-power river environment from 1:10000 scale sources. The changes identified by the GIS-based methodology include a decrease in channel mobility in a downstream direction; a predominantly oscillatory movement pattern in locations where channel movement has occurred; and an apparent propagation of a decrease in channel width downstream through the reach during the period since 1949, which is the main period of increasing flow regulation.","In recent years, GISbased studies of historical fluvial morphology were conducted over the long term to reveal the causes of past channel changes and floodplain degradation (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1994(Gurnell et al. , 2005Marston et al. 1995;Kiss et al. 2008).","['Reconstructing riverscapes over decades or even centuries better approximates the former situations than the reconstruction of a single point in time.', 'In recent years, GISbased studies of historical fluvial morphology were conducted over the long term to reveal the causes of past channel changes and floodplain degradation (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1994(Gurnell et al. , 2005Marston et al. 1995;Kiss et al. 2008).', 'Some historical studies specifically focus on the spatial distribution of riverine habitats and the land cover of riverscapes.', 'In Europe, such investigations were conducted on several French rivers (e.g.', 'Girel et al. 1997;Kondolf et al. 2007), the current Slovak Danube (Pisút 2002), the lower Rhine (Schoor et al. 1999;Wolfert 2001), the Dyje River, Czech Republic (Skokanova 2008) and on several English rivers (Lewin 2010).', 'Outside Europe, comparable studies exist for e.g. the upper Mississippi (de Jager et al. 2011) and the Sacramento River, California (Greco et al. 2007).', 'In ecology and environmental history alike, GIS techniques have often been deployed to reconstruct past land cover and land use changes based on historical maps such as cadastral maps.', 'These include, amongst others, the Baltimore-Chesapeake region (Foresman et al. 1997), the American Great Plains (Cunfer 2008), the Rocky Mountains (Aspinall 2004), Southern Germany (Bender et al. 2005;Schuppert and Dix 2009), the Tisza River in Hungary (Hegedüs and Duray 2009) and several Austrian villages and rivers (Forschungsinitiative Umweltgeschichte 1999;Haidvogl 2008).', 'Knowles (2002) has already demonstrated the potential of GIS techniques for historical research.']",0,"['In recent years, GISbased studies of historical fluvial morphology were conducted over the long term to reveal the causes of past channel changes and floodplain degradation (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1994(Gurnell et al. , 2005Marston et al. 1995;Kiss et al. 2008).', 'Some historical studies specifically focus on the spatial distribution of riverine habitats and the land cover of riverscapes.']"

These periods were strongly intertwined with both the history of the river and the history of the city. Urban expansion into the floodplains is demonstrated in this paper by investigating the island Unterer Werd, next to the city centre. In the late 17th century the fluvial dynamic still hampered urban development on the island. First measures to stabilise the river banks and to protect buildings from floods were taken soon thereafter, but the majority of practices aimed at mitigating the risks and impacts of the frequent floods: inundation was a part of the arrangement and the main target was to minimise the potential impacts. This practice also prevailed after the 1830s, when urban expansion began to move into the north and northwest of the island and the Danube floodplains were considered an important land resource for the growing city. In connection with new technologies and available means to channelise the river, the relationship between Vienna and the Danube changed fundamentally. Urban development in the riverine landscape gained new momentum. This process was initiated before the Great Danube Regulation from 1870 to 1875 was completed, the rate of growth accelerated after 1875. The last decades of the 19th century mark a turning point in the urban development of Vienna, with expanding urban areas becoming dependent upon a well functioning and maintained flood protection system.","True to its title, the plan shows the city with its fortifications and with the growing suburbs, which at that time had already spread into the riverine landscape-namely the Leopoldstadt on the large island confined by the Danube and the Donaukanal (here called the Neuer Canal; #AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2013, in this issue).","['In the first half of the 18th century, the number of topographical sources substantially increased, and from the late 18th century a great variety of different types are available.', 'At that time, topographical views and maps produced for commercial purposes gained 8 Except for Slezak (1980), who came to the same conclusion.', 'considerable public attention.', ""Several of these maps were created on the basis of the wellknown city map from Leander Anguissola and Johann Jacob Marinoni in 1704 and published under the title ''Accuratissima Viennae Austriae Ichnographica Delineatio'' (''Most accurate plan of Vienna in Austria'') in 1706. 12"", 'True to its title, the plan shows the city with its fortifications and with the growing suburbs, which at that time had already spread into the riverine landscape-namely the Leopoldstadt on the large island confined by the Danube and the Donaukanal (here called the Neuer Canal; #AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2013, in this issue).', 'In this plan the Danube itself is at least as important as the urban settlement.', 'The main contemporary intention of the plan was to show the newly strengthened fortifications of the Habsburg residence.', 'An additional second ring of fortification walls and ramparts (called the Linienwall) had been built in 1704 to better protect the residence.', ""This plan makes clear that the Danube was an essential part of the city's fortification system."", ""To the northeast, the Danube was Vienna's fortification."", 'In the floodplain, only parts of the Leopoldstadt and the head of the only bridge crossing the main arm of the Danube were fortified with man-made structures.', 'In later editions of the map up to c. 1785, only the settlement areas within the town were updated; the riverscape was depicted as unchanged, a pretence that the riverscape had been stable over decades.', ""However, the comparison with the famous ''Jagdatlas Kaiser Karls VI.''"", ""(''Atlas of imperial hunting grounds'') produced by J.

Concerning the Little Ice Age the conception of witchcraft is of enormous importance. Weather-making counts among the traditional abilities of witches. During the late 14th and 15th centuries the traditional conception of witchcraft was transformed into the idea of a great conspiracy of witches, to explain ""unnatural"" climatic phenomena. Because of their dangerous nature, particularly their ability to generate hailstorms, the very idea of witches was the subject of controversial discussion around 1500. The beginnings of meteorology and its emphasis of ""natural"" reasons in relationship to the development of weather must be seen against the background of this demoniacal discussion. The resurgence of the Little Ice Age revealed the susceptibility of society. Scapegoat reactions may be observed by the early 1560s even though climatologists, thus far, have been of the opinion that the cooling period did not begin until 1565. Despite attempts of containment, such as the calvinistic doctrine of predestination, extended witch-hunts took place at the various peaks of the Little Ice Age because a part of society held the witches directly responsible for the high frequency of climatic anomalies and the impacts thereof. The enormous tensions created in society as a result of the persecution of witches demonstrate how dangerous it is to discuss climatic change under the aspects of morality.","The major channel shifts at the Viennese Danube therefore have to be interpreted against the background of the Grindelwald Fluctuation, the first extreme phase of the Little Ice Age from the 1560s to the 1620s (Pfister 1980(Pfister , 2007#AUTHOR_TAG 1999;Hohensinner et al. 2013, in this issue).","['Taken together, the various historical sources document a major rearrangement of the Danube channel network.', ""In order to conclude whether identified fluvial dynamics reflect the river's typical behaviour rather than an exceptional hydromorphological state, climatic changes and related flood regimes also have to be considered (Howard 1996;McCarney-Castle et al. 2011;Macklin et al. 2012)."", 'For example, increasing runoff generally leads to channel straightening and profile widening.', 'Together with augmented sediment loads, it additionally fosters the transformation from meandering to braiding (Nanson and Knighton 1996;Marti and Bezzola 2004).', 'The major channel shifts at the Viennese Danube therefore have to be interpreted against the background of the Grindelwald Fluctuation, the first extreme phase of the Little Ice Age from the 1560s to the 1620s (Pfister 1980(Pfister , 2007#AUTHOR_TAG 1999;Hohensinner et al. 2013, in this issue).', 'Accordingly, the period from the mid to late 16th century must be considered as the key phase to understand the evolution of the riverscape, the intentions of discussed/implemented regulation measures and, consequently, the interpretation of historical sources in the following centuries.']",4,"['Taken together, the various historical sources document a major rearrangement of the Danube channel network.', 'The major channel shifts at the Viennese Danube therefore have to be interpreted against the background of the Grindelwald Fluctuation, the first extreme phase of the Little Ice Age from the 1560s to the 1620s (Pfister 1980(Pfister , 2007#AUTHOR_TAG 1999;Hohensinner et al. 2013, in this issue).', 'Accordingly, the period from the mid to late 16th century must be considered as the key phase to understand the evolution of the riverscape, the intentions of discussed/implemented regulation measures and, consequently, the interpretation of historical sources in the following centuries.']"

Terwee"", ""Dirk L. Knol"", ""Lex M. Bouter""]","Background: Reproducibility concerns the degree to which repeated measurements provide similar results. Agreement parameters assess how close the results of the repeated measurements are, by estimating the measurement error in repeated measurements. Reliability parameters assess whether study objects, often persons, can be distinguished from each other, despite measurement errors. In that case, the measurement error is related to the variability between persons. Consequently, reliability parameters are highly dependent on the heterogeneity of the study sample, while the agreement parameters, based on measurement error, are more a pure characteristic of the measurement instrument. Methods and Results: Using an example of an interrater study, in which different physical therapists measure the range of motion of the arm in patients with shoulder complaints, the differences and relationships between reliability and agreement parameters for continuous variables are illustrated. Conclusion: If the research question concerns the distinction of persons, reliability parameters are the most appropriate.

In collective decisions, however, only certain group members may have the opportunity to compare options. Emigrating ant colonies (Temnothorax albipennis) show sophisticated nest-site choice, selecting superior sites even when they are nine times further away than the alternative. How do they do this? We used radio-frequency identification-tagged ants to monitor individual behaviour. Here we show for the first time that switching between nests during the decision process can influence nest choice without requiring direct comparison of nests. Ants finding the poor nest were likely to switch and find the good nest, whereas ants finding the good nest were more likely to stay committed to that nest. When ants switched quickly between the two nests, colonies chose the good nest. Switching by ants that had the opportunity to compare nests had little effect on nest choice. We suggest a new mechanism of collective nest choice: individuals respond to nest quality by the decision either to commit or to seek alternatives.

Social insect colonies possess remarkable abilities to select the best among several courses of action. In populous societies with highly efficient recruitment behaviour, decision-making is distributed across many individuals, each acting on limited local information with appropriate decision rules. To investigate the degree to which small societies with less efficient recruitment can also employ distributed decision-making, we studied nest site selection in Leptothorax albipennis. Colonies were found to make sophisticated choices, taking into account not only the intrinsic qualities of each site, but also its value relative to the available options. In choices between two sites, individual ants were able to visit both sites, compare them and choose the better one. However, most ants encountered only one site in the course of an emigration. These poorly informed ants also contributed to the colony's decision, because their probability of initiating recruitment to a site depended on its quality. This led to shorter latencies between discovery and recruitment to a superior site, and so created greater amplification via positive feedback of the population at the better site. In short, these small colonies make use of a distributed mechanism of information processing, but also take advantage of direct decision-making by well-informed individuals. The latter feature may in part stem from the limitations of their social structure, but may also reflect the stringent demand for unanimous decisions by house-hunting colonies of any size.","First, ants could use a comparison strategy, in which ants that have visited both nests would compare their qualities and recruit nestmates only to the better one #AUTHOR_TAG.","['First, ants could use a comparison strategy, in which ants that have visited both nests would compare their qualities and recruit nestmates only to the better one #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Second, ants visiting just one nest could determine how long they hesitate before recruiting nestmates (recruitment latency) based on the nest quality [20].', 'A combination of these two mechanisms has been used as the basis of several decision models [18,[21][22][23][24].', 'Although lone T. rugatulus ant workers are capable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites which are very close together [25], the evidence for individual ants making direct comparisons between nests during colony emigration is weak [26], and furthermore, ant colonies are able to choose a distant good nest over a nearby poor nest, when recruitment latency differences would be expected to be cancelled out by travel time (Fig. 1a) [26,27].', ""The third possible mechanism of choice is a sequential search strategy, based on a very simple rule of thumb, a 'threshold rule', by which an ant assesses a nest against her own fixed quality threshold, and either accepts the nest and begins recruitment, or rejects it and continues searching [26]."", 'Qualitydependent recruitment latency has been demonstrated empirically only when colonies were presented with a single new nest and were not required to make a choice [20,22,24,28].', 'Robinson et al.

C. Pratt""]","Evolutionary theory predicts that animal decision makers should be rational, meaning that they consistently choose fitness-maximizing options. Despite this, violations of rationality have been found repeatedly in humans and other animals. The significance of these violations remains controversial, but many explanations point to cognitive limitations that prevent animals from adequately processing the information needed for fully rational choice. Instead, they rely on heuristics that usually work well but yield systematic errors in specific contexts. Although past research on rationality has focused on individuals, many highly integrated groups, such as ant colonies, regularly make consensus choices among food sources, nest sites, or other options. These collective choices emerge from local interactions among many group members, none of whom take on the whole burden of decision making. We hypothesized that groups may evade the irrational consequences of individual limitations by distributing their decision making across many group members. We tested this in the well-studied case of collective nest-site selection by Temnothorax ants. We found that individual ants, but not colonies, strongly violated rationality when presented with a challenging nest-site choice. Specifically, isolated individuals irrationally switched their preference between 2 alternative nest sites based on their experience of an unattractive decoy. Given the same choice, intact colonies maintained consistent preferences regardless of the decoy's presence. Previous studies have stressed how distributed decision making can filter out random errors made by group members. Our results show that collectives can also suppress systematic errors that emerge from the decision heuristics of cognitively limited individuals.

Pratt"", ""David J.T. Sumpter"", ""Eamonn B. Mallon"", ""Nigel R. Franks""]","Colonies of the ant Temnothorax (formerly Leptothorax) albipennis can collectively choose the best of several nest sites, even when many of the active ants who organize the move visit only one site. Previous studies have suggested that this ability stems from the ants' strategy of graded commitment to a potential home. On finding a site, an ant proceeds from independent assessment, to recruiting fellow active ants via slow tandem runs, to bringing the passive bulk of the colony via rapid transports. Assessment duration varies inversely with site quality, and the switch from tandem runs to transports requires that a quorum of ants first be summoned to the site. These rules may generate a collective decision, by creating and amplifying differential population growth rates among sites. We test the importance of these and other known behavioural rules by incorporating them into an agent-based model. All parameters governing individual behaviour were estimated from videotaped emigrations of individually marked ants given a single nest option of either good or mediocre quality. The time course of simulated emigrations and the distribution of behaviour across ants largely matched these observations, except for the speed with which the final transport phase was completed, and the overall emigration speed of one particularly large colony. The model also predicted the prevalence of splitting between sites when colonies had to choose between two sites of different quality, although it correctly predicted the degree of splitting in only four of six cases. It did not fully capture variance in colony performance, but it did predict the emergence of variation in individual behaviour, despite the use of identical parameter values for all ants. The model shows how, with adequate empirical data, the algorithmic form of a collective decision-making mechanism can be captured.","A combination of these two mechanisms has been used as the basis of several decision models [18,[21][22][23]#AUTHOR_TAG.","['First, ants could use a comparison strategy, in which ants that have visited both nests would compare their qualities and recruit nestmates only to the better one [20].', 'Second, ants visiting just one nest could determine how long they hesitate before recruiting nestmates (recruitment latency) based on the nest quality [20].', 'A combination of these two mechanisms has been used as the basis of several decision models [18,[21][22][23]#AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Although lone T. rugatulus ant workers are capable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites which are very close together [25], the evidence for individual ants making direct comparisons between nests during colony emigration is weak [26], and furthermore, ant colonies are able to choose a distant good nest over a nearby poor nest, when recruitment latency differences would be expected to be cancelled out by travel time (Fig. 1a) [26,27].', ""The third possible mechanism of choice is a sequential search strategy, based on a very simple rule of thumb, a 'threshold rule', by which an ant assesses a nest against her own fixed quality threshold, and either accepts the nest and begins recruitment, or rejects it and continues searching [26]."", 'Qualitydependent recruitment latency has been demonstrated empirically only when colonies were presented with a single new nest and were not required to make a choice [20,22,24,28].', 'Robinson et al.

The colonies had to choose a new nest site when presented with two or more potential nest sites, each with different attributes or different combinations of attributes. For Leptothorax albipennis colonies in the laboratory, darkness of the nest cavity, internal height of the cavity and width of the entrance were all important attributes. The colonies ranked these attributes: darkness of the nest site was more important than internal cavity height, which in turn was more important than entrance width. These choices conform to the logic of transitivity. In addition, the colonies used a sophisticated decision-making strategy in which they took all alternatives and all attributes into consideration. Furthermore, the ants, in effect, weighed the different values of different attributes. They also chose the best nest when presented with only one excellent nest among four mediocre ones or one excellent nest in an array of one excellent, one good and one mediocre. Altogether, our results suggest that these ant colonies, in deciding upon a new home, used a weighted additive strategy, one of the most computationally expensive and thorough decision-making strategies.

One hundred seventy-two years after DarwinÕs wedding, we reconsider whether this process of choice, under which individuals assign values to their options and compare their relative merits at the time of choosing (the tug-of-war model), applies to our experimental animal, the European Starling, Sturnus vulgaris. We contrast this with the sequential choice model that postulates that decision-makers make no comparison between options at the time of choice. According to the latter, behaviour in simultaneous choices reflects adaptations to contexts with sequential encounters, in which the choice is whether to take an opportunity or let it pass. We postulate that, in sequential encounters, the decision-maker assigns (by learning) a subjective value to each option, reflecting its payoff relative to background opportunities. This value is expressed as latency and/or probability to accept each opportunity as opposed to keep searching. In simultaneous encounters, choice occurs through each option being processed independently, by a race between the mechanisms that generate option-specific latencies. We describe these alternative models and review data supporting the predictions of the sequential choice model.","One simple but effective strategy is sequential search in which the animal keeps searching until it finds an option that exceeds a threshold of acceptability [2,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['Animals need to make choices between multiple available options at many stages in their life histories, such as during mate selection, foraging, or when deciding where to shelter or to build a nest.', 'The fitness benefits of choosing the best option mean that decision-making strategies will be subject to natural selection.', ""Multiple comparison or 'best of n' strategies perform most accurately, and are likely to be optimal when searching and sampling costs are low, e.g. on a lek [1,2] and when long-term fitness implications of the decision are high, e.g. in home range selection [3]."", 'In other situations, e.g. during foraging, there can be substantial time costs to making accurate decisions [4,5], and these costs can be so great as to make quicker less accurate decisions more efficient [6].', ""Animals may be best served by using a simpler 'rule of thumb', which reduces sampling time, but still ensures the option they choose is good enough."", 'One simple but effective strategy is sequential search in which the animal keeps searching until it finds an option that exceeds a threshold of acceptability [2,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'This kind of fixedthreshold strategy is used in foraging [8], mate choice [9] and refuge selection [10].', ""An intermediate strategy is to allow thresholds to be influenced by experience of previous options; in effect this would cause a 'sequential comparison'.""]",0,"['One simple but effective strategy is sequential search in which the animal keeps searching until it finds an option that exceeds a threshold of acceptability [2,#AUTHOR_TAG].']"

We investigated how this ability emerges from the behaviors used by ants to recruit nestmates to potential homes. We found that, in a given emigration, only one-third of the colony's workers ever recruit. At first, they summon fellow recruiters via tandem runs, in which a single follower is physically led all the way to the new site. They later switch to recruiting the passive majority of the colony via transports, in which nestmates are simply carried to the site. After this switch, tandem runs continue sporadically but now run in the opposite direction, leading recruiters back to the old nest. Recruitment accelerates with the start of transport, which proceeds at a rate 3 times greater than that of tandem runs. The recruitment switch is triggered by population increase at the new site, such that ants lead tandem runs when the site is relatively empty, but change to transport once a quorum of nestmates is present. A model shows that the quorum requirement can help a colony choose the best available site, even when few ants have the opportunity to compare sites directly, because recruiters to a given site launch the rapid transport of the bulk of the colony only if enough active ants have been ""convinced"" of the worth of the site. This exemplifies how insect societies can achieve adaptive colony-level behaviors from the decentralized interactions of relatively poorly informed insects, each combining her own limited direct information with indirect cues about the experience of her nestmates.","When the number of ants at a site reaches a 'quorum threshold', the ants switch to rapid transport behaviour to carry the brood, queen and remaining nest-mates to the new nest #AUTHOR_TAG.","['A colony emigration by rock ants begins with scouts searching for and assessing new sites.', 'Successful scouts recruit nest-mates using tandem running, in which an informed ant leads another to the new site [17].', ""When the number of ants at a site reaches a 'quorum threshold', the ants switch to rapid transport behaviour to carry the brood, queen and remaining nest-mates to the new nest #AUTHOR_TAG."", 'Ant colonies discriminate between nest sites on the basis of a range of attributes including cavity dimensions, light level and entrance width [16,19].', 'Three possible mechanisms by which the colony collectively chooses the better of two nests have been proposed: i) comparison ii) recruitment latency iii) threshold rule.']",0,"[""When the number of ants at a site reaches a 'quorum threshold', the ants switch to rapid transport behaviour to carry the brood, queen and remaining nest-mates to the new nest #AUTHOR_TAG.""]"

Seeley"", ""Susannah C. Buhrman""]","Abstract. This study views a honey bee swarm as a supraorganismal entity which has been shaped by natural selection to be skilled at choosing a future home site. Prior studies of this decision-making process indicate that swarms attempt to use the best-of-N decision rule: sample some number (N) of alternatives and then select the best one. We tested how well swarms implement this decision rule by presenting them with an array of five nest boxes, only one of which was a high-quality (desirable) nest site; the other four were medium-quality (acceptable) sites. We found that swarms are reasonably good at carrying out the best-of-N decision rule: in four out of five trials, swarms selected the best site. In addition, we gained insights into how a swarm implements this decision rule. We found that when a scout bee returns to the swarm cluster and advertises a potential nest site with a waggle dance, she tunes the strength of her dance in relation to the quality of her site: the better the site, the stronger the dance. A dancing bee tunes her dance strength by adjusting the number of waggle-runs/dance, and she adjusts the number of waggle-runs/dance by changing both the duration and the rate of her waggle-run production. Moreover, we found that a dancing bee changes the rate of her waggle-run production by changing the mean duration of the return-phase portion of her dance circuits. Differences in return-phase duration underlie the impression that dances differ in liveliness. Although a honey bee swarm has bounded rationality (e.g., it lacks complete knowledge of the possible nesting sites), through its capacity for parallel processing it can choose a nest site without greatly reducing either the breadth or depth of its consideration of the alternative sites. Such thoroughness of information gathering and processing no doubt helps a swarm implement the best-of-N decision rule.","In contrast, bees use a graded process, whereby scouts initially discovering a new nest-site almost always recruit [41], but the duration and rate of the recruiting waggle-dances are dependent on nest quality #AUTHOR_TAG.","['The second previously-proposed mechanism, quality

second higher quality site is introduced, the same small proportion of ants will accept the poor site early due to low-threshold or assessment error, but the remainder will now tend to discover the

Langen""]","Abstract Western scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) often visually assess and handle several whole (unshelled) peanuts before selecting one to transport and cache; this behavior is a search for a preferred heavy nut. I repeatedly video-taped individually identifiable jays as they landed on a feeding platform and chose from presentations of peanuts that varied in the number of items or in the distribution of sizes. I examined how differences among these presentations and a bird's social status affected the amount of assessment and the economic consequences of choice. I also examined the specific patterns of handling peanuts, called sampling, to quantify the degree to which sampling sequences were typified by repeated comparisons among sampled peanuts (retrospective sampling), or sequential assessment and rejection of peanuts (prospective sampling). Peanut assessment was more extensive and prospective when there were many options from which to choose than when there were few. Peanut assessment was more extensive and retrospective when options were similar in size than when they varied. Scrub-jays were more likely to make repeated comparisons immediately before selecting a peanut than elsewhere in a sampling sequence. Subordinate scrub-jays, who were at the greatest risk of pre-emption by competitors, assessed peanuts less extensively and were more prospective in their sampling than dominants. Unless peanuts were very similar in size, jays were more accurate at selecting a high-quality peanut and achieved a higher rate of food storage than if they had not assessed. These results show that scrub-jays can adaptively modify how they search to improve their rate of food storage, and also suggest some of the specific search tactics used by jays when assessing peanuts.","This kind of fixedthreshold strategy is used in foraging #AUTHOR_TAG, mate choice [9] and refuge selection [10].","['Animals need to make choices between multiple available options at many stages in their life histories, such as during mate selection, foraging, or when deciding where to shelter or to build a nest.', 'The fitness benefits of choosing the best option mean that decision-making strategies will be subject to natural selection.', ""Multiple comparison or 'best of n' strategies perform most accurately, and are likely to be optimal when searching and sampling costs are low, e.g. on a lek [1,2] and when long-term fitness implications of the decision are high, e.g. in home range selection [3]."", 'In other situations, e.g. during foraging, there can be substantial time costs to making accurate decisions [4,5], and these costs can be so great as to make quicker less accurate decisions more efficient [6].', ""Animals may be best served by using a simpler 'rule of thumb', which reduces sampling time, but still ensures the option they choose is good enough."", 'One simple but effective strategy is sequential search in which the animal keeps searching until it finds an option that exceeds a threshold of acceptability [2,7].', 'This kind of fixedthreshold strategy is used in foraging #AUTHOR_TAG, mate choice [9] and refuge selection [10].', ""An intermediate strategy is to allow thresholds to be influenced by experience of previous options; in effect this would cause a 'sequential comparison'.""]",0,"['This kind of fixedthreshold strategy is used in foraging #AUTHOR_TAG, mate choice [9] and refuge selection [10].']"

CCT26,5225915,A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to Explain Sophisticated Collective Decision-Making,Elva Robinson,Behavioral mechanisms of collective nest-site choice by the ant Temnothorax curvispinosus,"[""S. C. Pratt""]","Abstract.This paper examines the individual behavior underlying collective choice among nest sites by the ant Temnothorax (formerly Leptothorax) curvispinosus. Colonies can actively compare options, rejecting a mediocre site when it is paired with a good one, but accepting the same mediocre design if it is instead paired with a worse site. This ability emerges from the behavior of an active minority of workers who organize emigrations. When one of these finds a promising site, she recruits nest mates to it, but only after a delay that varies inversely with site quality. Ants first recruit fellow active ants via slow tandem runs, but eventually switch to speedier transports of the colony's passive majority. Later transports grow faster still, as ants improve their speed with experience. An ant's choice of recruitment type is governed by a quorum rule, such that her likelihood of starting to transport increases with the population of the new site. The size of the quorum depends on experience, with ants demanding a larger population to launch immediately into transport than they do to switch to transport after first leading a few tandem runs. Perception of quorum attainment requires direct contact between ants. The ants' behavior qualitatively matches that of T. albipennis, where models have shown that decentralized choice of the best site depends on quality-dependent recruitment delays, amplified by a quorum rule for initiating transport. Parameter estimates for an agent-based model show significant quantitative differences between the species, and suggest that T. albipennis may place relatively greater emphasis on emigration speed.","Qualitydependent recruitment latency has been demonstrated empirically only when colonies were presented with a single new nest and were not required to make a choice [20,22,24,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['First, ants could use a comparison strategy, in which ants that have visited both nests would compare their qualities and recruit nestmates only to the better one [20].', 'Second, ants visiting just one nest could determine how long they hesitate before recruiting nestmates (recruitment latency) based on the nest quality [20].', 'A combination of these two mechanisms has been used as the basis of several decision models [18,[21][22][23][24].', 'Although lone T. rugatulus ant workers are capable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites which are very close together [25], the evidence for individual ants making direct comparisons between nests during colony emigration is weak [26], and furthermore, ant colonies are able to choose a distant good nest over a nearby poor nest, when recruitment latency differences would be expected to be cancelled out by travel time (Fig. 1a) [26,27].', ""The third possible mechanism of choice is a sequential search strategy, based on a very simple rule of thumb, a 'threshold rule', by which an ant assesses a nest against her own fixed quality threshold, and either accepts the nest and begins recruitment, or rejects it and continues searching [26]."", 'Qualitydependent recruitment latency has been demonstrated empirically only when colonies were presented with a single new nest and were not required to make a choice [20,22,24,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'Robinson et al.

CCT31,5225915,A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to Explain Sophisticated Collective Decision-Making,Elva Robinson,Collective decision-making in honey bees: how colonies choose among nectar sources,"[""ThomasD. Seeley"", ""Scott Camazine"", ""James Sneyd""]","A honey bee colony can skillfully choose among nectar sources. It will selectively exploit the most profitable source in an array and will rapidly shift its foraging efforts following changes in the array. How does this colony-level ability emerge from the behavior of individual bees? The answer lies in understanding how bees modulate their colony's rates of recruitment and abandonment for nectar sources in accordance with the profitability of each source. A forager modulates its behavior in relation to nectar source profitability: as profitability increases, the tempo of foraging increases, the intensity of dancing increases, and the probability of abandoning the source decreases. How does a forager assess the profitability of its nectar source? Bees accomplish this without making comparisons among nectar sources. Neither do the foragers compare different nectar sources to determine the relative profitability of any one source, nor do the food storers compare different nectar loads and indicate the relative profitability of each load to the foragers. Instead, each forager knows only about its particular nectar source and independently calculates the absolute profitability of its source. Even though each of a colony's foragers operates with extremely limited information about the colony's food sources, together they will generate a coherent colonylevel response to different food sources in which better ones are heavily exploited and poorer ones are abandoned. This is shown by a computer simulation of nectar-source selection by a colony in which foragers behave as described above. Nectar-source selection by honey bee colonies is a process of natural selection among alternative nectar sources as foragers from more profitable sources ÒsurviveÓ (continue visiting their source) longer and ÒreproduceÓ (recruit other foragers) better than do foragers from less profitable sources. Hence this colonial decision-making is based on decentralized control.

Neural network analyses show that cognitive features found in insects, such as numerosity, attention and categorisation-like processes, may require only very limited neuron numbers. Thus, brain size may have less of a relationship with behavioural repertoire and cognitive capacity than generally assumed, prompting the question of what large brains are for. Larger brains are, at least partly, a consequence of larger neurons that are necessary in large animals due to basic biophysical constraints. They also contain greater replication of neuronal circuits, adding precision to sensory processes, detail to perception, more parallel processing and enlarged storage capacity.

A proximate-level hypothesis was tested about decision making in honey bees, Apis mellifera. Fifteen bees were given binary choices between artificial flowers that varied in depth and in volume of sucrose-water delivered. Three bees violated weak stochastic transitivity, under an assumption about the order in which the flowers ranked along a utility scale; they preferred flower A to flower B, B to C, C to D, but D to A. These bees also violated strong stochastic transitivity, which focuses on the strength rather than the direction of preference. An intransitive pattern of choice supports the hypothesis of 'comparative' evaluation of flowers, where options are compared along their different dimensions, each dimension separately. Intransitivities cannot be explained by an 'absolute' model, where each option is evaluated independently and assigned a fixed value (utility). Twelve of the bees made choices that were consistent with both absolute and comparative models of decision making. In light of the above results it is suggested that the assumption that animals employ an absolute method of decision making be reconsidered, and perhaps supplemented with a comparative account. Possible evolutionary advantages of comparative evaluations are discussed.","Male dance-flies compare the size of potential mates before choosing [54], and there is evidence to suggest that honeybee workers are capable of comparative evaluation of flowers #AUTHOR_TAG and that lone T. rugatulus ant workers are capable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites which are very close together [25].","['Direct comparison of alternatives is seen in a range of animals and contexts, including foraging in scrub jays and humans [8,52], mate choice in bower-birds and dance-flies [53,54] and shell assessment by hermit crabs [55].', 'A best-of-n comparison strategy would maximise decision accuracy [2], so why do neither individual bees nor ants appear to use this strategy when foraging or choosing a new home?', 'One possibility is that multiple comparisons are too cognitively complex for ant and bee brains.', 'However, small insects including bees are competent at related cognitive processes, including contextual learning, discrimination between stimuli and associative recall [56].', 'Male dance-flies compare the size of potential mates before choosing [54], and there is evidence to suggest that honeybee workers are capable of comparative evaluation of flowers #AUTHOR_TAG and that lone T. rugatulus ant workers are capable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites which are very close together [25].', 'There may, therefore, be reasons other than cognitive constraints for why relying on individual best-of-n comparisons to inform collective choices does not appear to have evolved as a decision mechanism in bees or ants.', 'One possible reason is that during their evolutionary history the ants have typically been faced with decisions about whether to accept a single option at a time, rather than simultaneously having information about multiple options, and this has shaped the evolution of their decision process [7].', 'Another possible reason is the potential speed advantage of avoiding a sampling period.', 'Sampling periods can be costly [2,7] and pose the mathematically complex problem of deciding how long to sample for before starting the decision process [58].', 'Avoiding best-of-n comparisons allows a potentially vulnerable colony to select the first nest encountered, if it is good enough.', 'Perhaps even more important is distributing the decision-making process, relying less on information-processing by a single individual; rather allowing the decision to emerge from a collective process to which even partly-informed individuals can contribute.', 'In this colony-level cognition, the relevant information about the environment is represented within the individuals in a colony, their actions and interactions.', 'At the collective level this generates new information: which nest the colony should choose [59].', 'In both bees and ants, the information held by individuals is integrated into a colony choice by means of a quorum threshold, which triggers rapid implementation of the decision [18,60].', ""Although the colony will usually choose the site which reaches quorum first, this does not mean that the colony as a whole must 'satisfice', accepting the first nest surpassing some minimum standard."", 'Using quality-dependent initiation (in Temnothorax ants) or modulation (in honeybees) of the recruitment process leading to the attainment of a quorum, the colony in effect carries out a concurrent but indirect collective comparison process, which may implement optimal decision-making through the actions of partly-informed individuals [61].', 'This ensures that the nest to reach a quorum first is also likely to be the best option, even when there is an array of possible alternatives [16,42].', ""Thus without the individuals using a 'best-of-n' comparison strategy, the colony is able to solve a 'best-of-n' challenge [16,62].""]",1,"['Male dance-flies compare the size of potential mates before choosing [54], and there is evidence to suggest that honeybee workers are capable of comparative evaluation of flowers #AUTHOR_TAG and that lone T. rugatulus ant workers are capable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites which are very close together [25].']"

Edwards"", ""Stephen C. Pratt""]","Economic models of animal behaviour assume that decision-makers are rational, meaning that they assess options according to intrinsic fitness value and not by comparison with available alternatives. This expectation is frequently violated, but the significance of irrational behaviour remains controversial. One possibility is that irrationality arises from cognitive constraints that necessitate short cuts like comparative evaluation. If so, the study of whether and when irrationality occurs can illuminate cognitive mechanisms. We applied this logic in a novel setting: the collective decisions of insect societies. We tested for irrationality in colonies of Temnothorax ants choosing between two nest sites that varied in multiple attributes, such that neither site was clearly superior. In similar situations, individual animals show irrational changes in preference when a third relatively unattractive option is introduced. In contrast, we found no such effect in colonies. We suggest that immunity to irrationality in this case may result from the ants' decentralized decision mechanism. A colony's choice does not depend on site comparison by individuals, but instead self-organizes from the interactions of multiple ants, most of which are aware of only a single site. This strategy may filter out comparative effects, preventing systematic errors that would otherwise arise from the cognitive limitations of individuals.","For example, emigrating T. albipennis colonies follow rational transitivity patterns in decision making [16] and in the related species T. curvispinosus and T. rugatulus, colonies seem to be immune to irrational distractor effects from irrelevant alternatives [25,#AUTHOR_TAG].","[""A further possible advantage of avoiding individual direct comparisons is that it would remove the risk of 'irrational' decision behaviour at the individual level [26], associated with comparative, relative evaluation of options such as best-of-n, or sequential comparisons."", 'Individuals following our proposed threshold rule make an absolute evaluation of quality, and this evaluation of one option is not influenced by the other alternatives available, in contrast to the context-dependent decision-making used by many other animals including humans [8,63,64].', 'Although at the collective level, a comparison between options is effectively being made, a non-comparative individual-level mechanism for this decision could protect the colony from irrationality in decisionmaking.', 'For example, emigrating T. albipennis colonies follow rational transitivity patterns in decision making [16] and in the related species T. curvispinosus and T. rugatulus, colonies seem to be immune to irrational distractor effects from irrelevant alternatives [25,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'Although work on T. rugatulus suggests that this collective immunity can emerge even if individuals are susceptible to distractor effects provided their individual contribution to the collective decision is small [25], our work suggests this collective rationality can emerge without depending on low numbers of ants visiting both nests -if individual ants follow the threshold rule, then the colony can escape these irrational comparison behaviours.']",3,"['For example, emigrating T. albipennis colonies follow rational transitivity patterns in decision making [16] and in the related species T. curvispinosus and T. rugatulus, colonies seem to be immune to irrational distractor effects from irrelevant alternatives [25,#AUTHOR_TAG].']"

Healey"", ""Stephen C. Pratt""]","Animals are expected to follow decision-making strategies that balance the benefits of choosing the best option with the costs of finding and assessing candidates. Because costs and benefits will vary across time and space, an animal may profit by adjusting its tactics according to recent experience. In particular, animals should be less selective when experience indicates that the average quality of options is low. We tested this prediction in the context of nest site selection by the ant Temnothorax curvispinosus. Colonies received prolonged exposure either to a good or to a poor nest and then were tested for their readiness to accept a mediocre nest. Previous studies have shown that colonies move more rapidly into nests that they rate more highly, as a result of faster recruitment initiation by individual ants. Hence, if exposure to a low-quality nest makes colonies more willing to accept a mediocre one, we predicted speedier moves into the mediocre nest after the poor treatment than after the good treatment.

In addition, individual experience has been suggested to influence workers in their decision to execute a task [13-18], but its potential impact on the organization of insect societies has yet to be demonstrated [19, 20]. Here we show that, all else being equal, ant workers engaged in distinct functions in accordance with their previous experience. When individuals were experimentally led to discover prey at each of their foraging attempts, they showed a high propensity for food exploration. Conversely, foraging activity progressively decreased for individuals who always failed in the same situation. One month later, workers that previously found prey kept on exploring for food, whereas those who always failed specialized in brood care. It thus appears that individual experience can strongly channel the behavioral ontogeny of ants to generate a lasting division of labor.

Schmidt"", ""Dirk Louis P. Schorkopf"", ""Michael Hrncir"", ""Ronaldo Zucchi"", ""Friedrich G. Barth""]","We examined the ability of Trigona recursa, a scent trail-laying stingless bee, to allocate foragers to the more profitable of two food sources. Imbibing time and imbibed volume of individuals were the same at feeders containing 20% or 40% w/w (weight in weight) sugar solution. However, sugar intake rate and sugar per crop load were significantly higher for the 40% solution, which was therefore more profitable. Collective foraging of two colonies was observed without interference with the recruitment process. One bee was trained to a 20% food source and another at the same time to a 40% source. Recruitment to both food sources started simultaneously. In all trials the majority of recruits landed at the 40% food source. This cannot be the result of bees comparing the two sugar concentrations because less than 1% of the recruits landed at both feeders. When we offered the 20% food source 90 min before the 40% source, the newcomers at the 40% food source never outnumbered the newcomers at the 20% source. Significantly more recruits landed at the less profitable food source. This is likely to be caused by a positive feedback resulting from the large number of bees that had already exploited the poor source and reinforced the scent trail. New recruits presumably selected the more intensively marked trail, neglecting the new and weakly marked one that would lead them to the richer food.","In trail-laying ants and bees, pheromone trails to better foraging sites are more strongly reinforced and this again leads to a collective choice without any necessity for individuals to visit multiple sites [47,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['Collective decisions are also made in other contexts, such as choice of foraging site.', 'Here again, comparisons of sites by individuals seems to play little role.', 'Foraging honeybees do not compare food sources [43], nor do they compare the waggle-dances of recruiters at the hive [44].', ""Rather, multiple sites 'compete' for foragers, with bees foraging more persistently at high quality sites and recruiting to them more energetically [43,45]."", ""Foragers can also directly inhibit recruitment if they perceive danger at a particular food source by the use of 'stop-signals' directed at bees recruiting to that source [46]."", 'In trail-laying ants and bees, pheromone trails to better foraging sites are more strongly reinforced and this again leads to a collective choice without any necessity for individuals to visit multiple sites [47,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'Just as for nest-site choice, foraging recruitment can either be graded (laying more pheromone to a better food source, e.g.', '[47,49]) or a binary decision (all-or-nothing recruitment, e.g.', '[50,51]).']",1,"['In trail-laying ants and bees, pheromone trails to better foraging sites are more strongly reinforced and this again leads to a collective choice without any necessity for individuals to visit multiple sites [47,#AUTHOR_TAG].']"

Kirk Visscher""]","The choice of a new nest site is ecologically critical for an insect colony. In swarm-founding social insects, or those that move as colonies from one site to another, this choice is one of the best-available examples of a distributed, nonhierarchical decision-making process in animals. In the few species of ants and bees that have been studied in detail, the main features of this collective decision making are strikingly similar, although some differences occur. Individual scouts discover potential nest sites and integrate multiple properties of these sites into assessments of their quality. The discovered sites then compete for a limited pool of nest-site scouts, and attrition of less-favored sites occurs by several mechanisms. Finally, the mass movement of the colony to the new site is triggered by a quorum-sensing mechanism when sufficient scouts are present at one of the alternatives. Movement itself is coordinated by different mechanisms in different insects.","Searching for alternatives has a more prominent role in later versions of the recruitment latency model [24] making it

Nieh""]","Decision making in superorganisms such as honey bee colonies often uses self-organizing behaviors, feedback loops that allow the colony to gather information from multiple individuals and achieve reliable and agile solutions. Honey bees use positive feedback from the waggle dance to allocate colony foraging effort. However, the use of negative feedback signals by superorganisms is poorly understood. I show that conspecific attacks at a food source lead to the production of stop signals, communication that was known to reduce waggle dancing and recruitment but lacked a clear natural trigger. Signalers preferentially targeted nestmates visiting the same food source, on the basis of its odor. During aggressive food competition, attack victims increased signal production by 43 fold. Foragers that attacked competitors or experienced no aggression did not alter signal production. Biting ambush predators also attack foragers at flowers. Simulated biting of foragers or exposure to bee alarm pheromone also elicited signaling (88-fold and 14-fold increases, respectively). This provides the first clear evidence of a negative feedback signal elicited by foraging peril to counteract the positive feedback of the waggle dance. As in intra- and intercellular communication, negative feedback may play an important, though currently underappreciated, role in self-organizing behaviors within superorganisms.Copyright  2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Seeley"", ""Alexander S. Mikheyev"", ""Gary J.

However, no one had measured both dance duration and liveliness as a function of food-source profitability. Using video analysis, we found that nectar foragers adjust both the duration (D) and the rate (R) of waggle-run production, thereby tuning the number of waggle runs produced per foraging trip (W, where W= DR) as a function of food-source profitability. Both duration and rate of waggle-run production increase with rising food-source profitability. Moreover, we found that a dancing bee adjusts the rate of waggle-run production (R) in relation to food-source profitability by adjusting the mean duration of the return-phase portion of her dance circuits. This finding raises the possibility that bees can use return-phase duration as an index of food-source profitability. Finally, dances having different levels of liveliness have different mean durations of the return phase, indicating that dance liveliness can be quantified in terms of the time interval between consecutive waggle runs.","Rather, multiple sites 'compete' for foragers, with bees foraging more persistently at high quality sites and recruiting to them more energetically [43,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['Collective decisions are also made in other contexts, such as choice of foraging site.', 'Here again, comparisons of sites by individuals seems to play little role.', 'Foraging honeybees do not compare food sources [43], nor do they compare the waggle-dances of recruiters at the hive [44].', ""Rather, multiple sites 'compete' for foragers, with bees foraging more persistently at high quality sites and recruiting to them more energetically [43,#AUTHOR_TAG]."", ""Foragers can also directly inhibit recruitment if they perceive danger at a particular food source by the use of 'stop-signals' directed at bees recruiting to that source [46]."", 'In trail-laying ants and bees, pheromone trails to better foraging sites are more strongly reinforced and this again leads to a collective choice without any necessity for individuals to visit multiple sites [47,48].', 'Just as for nest-site choice, foraging recruitment can either be graded (laying more pheromone to a better food source, e.g.', '[47,49]) or a binary decision (all-or-nothing recruitment, e.g.', '[50,51]).']",1,"[""Rather, multiple sites 'compete' for foragers, with bees foraging more persistently at high quality sites and recruiting to them more energetically [43,#AUTHOR_TAG].""]"

In a few cases (but not in many others), these differences can be linked to visual ecology. Other insects have virtually identical sets of color receptors despite strong differences in lifestyle. Instead of the adaptionism that has dominated visual ecology in the past, we propose that chance evolutionary processes, history, and constraints should be considered. In addition to phylogenetic analyses designed to explore these factors, we suggest quantifying variance between individuals and populations and using fitness measurements to test the adaptive value of traits identified in insect color vision systems.","Two nests had clear acetate lids and one had a red filter covering the cavity area, making the nest appear relatively dark to the ants #AUTHOR_TAG.","[""'Three-New-Nests' Experiment."", 'Six T. albipennis colonies were collected from the Dorset coast, England, June-July 2009.', 'Colonies were queenright and contained 80-200 workers and brood of all stages.', 'Colonies were housed in artificial nests [27] and provided with water ad libitum and honey solution and Drosophila melanogaster weekly.', 'We used these colonies to investigate decision-making when a colony was offered a choice of three new nests.', 'Six trials were performed, each with a new colony.', 'One day prior to an emigration trial, we attached an RFID microtransponder (50065006120 mm) with a unique ID to the thorax of every worker ant in the colony [32,33] and housed the colony in a nest formed of a hexagonal glass slide (edge length = 30 mm), a 1.5 mm cardboard perimeter (cavity area 1496 mm ) and an acetate lid with a central entrance hole (1.5 mm diameter) to avoid introducing directional bias.', 'We performed trials in a circular arena with Fluon-coated sides, the floor of which was cleaned with water and alcohol between trials.', 'Three new hexagonal nests with the same dimensions as the original nest were placed in the arena (Fig. 1c).', 'Two nests had clear acetate lids and one had a red filter covering the cavity area, making the nest appear relatively dark to the ants #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Ant colonies choose dark over light nests [19].', 'The position of the good nest was interchanged between trials.', 'The new nests had 1.5 mm wide entrances in the side facing the centre of the arena, over which RFID readers (PharmaSeq, Inc., NJ) were placed vertically.', 'A trial began with the original nest placed in the centre of the arena and then destroyed by removing the lid.', 'The RFID readers detected ants entering and leaving the new nests [86% tag read rate, 26] and we used handheld RFID readers to read the tags on tandem-running ants (94% tag read rate) as they crossed half-way lines (Fig. 1c).', 'The identity of the leader and follower was thus recorded and the direction of the tandem run was noted.', 'This procedure does not disrupt tandem runs [26].', 'The time at which the transport by carrying of a nest-mate or a brood item first occurred to each nest was recorded (i.e. the time at which the quorum threshold was reached).', 'Once nest-mate transport has commenced, the RFID system becomes less reliable [26], because nest-mates are transported in such a way as to block the RFID tag.', 'We therefore focused our analysis on searching and recruitment by tandem-running during the pre-quorum period.', 'We observed emigrations until complete (old nest empty of brood and workers) and recorded the nest choice of the colony after 24 hours.', 'Colonies were considered to have split if brood was present in two or more nests.']",0,"[""'Three-New-Nests' Experiment."", 'Two nests had clear acetate lids and one had a red filter covering the cavity area, making the nest appear relatively dark to the ants #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Ant colonies choose dark over light nests [19].', 'The position of the good nest was interchanged between trials.']"

Empirical observations of four bird species show that females selectively visit males and repeat visits to males before mating. This suggests that the assumptions of previous models have been too restrictive. An alternative model of information gathering and mate choice, which relaxes the assumptions of random encounters and perfect information, is presented. In this Comparative Bayes model, the decision of when and from whom to collect information is made using Bayesian estimates of each male's quality. Predictions from the model are that: (1) the occurrence of mate assessment will increase as initial uncertainty about the quality of males increases, as the cost of gathering information decreases, and as the signal perceived by the female becomes a better representation of males' actual qualities; (2) the occurrence of repeat visits to males will be highest when signals from males are of medium reliability; and (3) the decision of which male to assess will depend on the estimated qualities of males, prior certainty about each male's quality, the reliability of each male's signal, and the costs of assessment. Simulations compare the fitness outcomes of the Comparative Bayes tactic to other mate choice tactics.

Next, we use the model to study the ""design"" of the nest-site selection process, with a focus on how certain behavioral parameters have been tuned by natural selection to achieve a balance between speed and accuracy. First, we study the effects of the quorum threshold and the dance decay rate.

Second, we study the adaptive tuning of the tendency of bees to explore for vs be recruited to a site. We show that this tendency appears to be tuned to regulate the positive feedback process of recruitment to ensure both a reasonably rapid choice and a low probability of a poor choice.

Kirk Visscher""]","This study investigates the first stage of the decision-making process of a honeybee swarm as it chooses a nest site: how a scout bee codes the value of a potential nest site in the waggle dances she produces to represent this site. We presented honeybee swarms with a two-alternative choice between a high-value site and a medium-value site and recorded the behavior of individually identifiable scout bees as they reported on these two alternatives. We found that bees performed equally lengthy inspections at the two sites, but that, on the swarm cluster, they performed more dance circuits per bee for the high-value site. We also found that there was much individual-level noise in the coding of site value, but that there were clear population-level differences in total dance circuits produced for the two sites. The first bee to find a site had a high probability of reporting the site with a waggle dance, regardless of its value. This discoverer-should-dance phenomenon may help ensure that a swarm gives attention to all discovered sites. There was rapid decay in the dance response; the number of dance circuits produced by a bee after visiting a site decreased linearly over sequential visits, and eventually each bee ceased visiting her site. This decay, or ;leakage', in the accumulation of bees at a site improves a swarm's decision-making ability by helping a swarm avoid making fast-decision errors.","In contrast, bees use a graded

CCT52,5225915,A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to Explain Sophisticated Collective Decision-Making,Elva Robinson,Tactics of dance choice in honey bees: do foragers compare dances?,"[""ThomasD. Seeley"", ""WilliamF. Towne""]","Summary(1) When a honey bee follows recruitment dances to locate a new food source, does she sample multiple dances representing different food sources and selectively respond to the strongest dance? (2) Several initial findings suggested that foragers might indeed compare dances. First, dance information is arrayed in the hive in a way that facilitates comparison-making: dances for different flower patches are performed close together in time and space. Second, food-source quality is coded in the dances, in terms of dance length (number of circuits per dance). Third, dances to natural food sources vary in length by more than 2 orders of magnitude, indicating that the quality of natural food sources varies greatly. Fourth, foragers seeking a new food source follow several dances before exiting the hive (though only one dance is followed closely). (3) Nevertheless, a critical test for comparison-making revealed that foragers evidently do not compare dances. A colony was given two feeders that were equidistant from the hive but different in profitability. If foragers do not compare dances, then the proportion of recruits arriving at the richer feeder should match the proportion of dance circuits for the richer feeder. This is the pattern that we found in all 11 trials of the experiment. (4) We suggest that the reason foragers do not compare dances is that a colony's foraging success is greater if its foragers distribute themselves among the various food sources being advertised in the hive than if they crowd themselves on the one, best source. (5) Food-source selection by honey bee colonies is a democratic decision-making process. This study reveals that this selection process is organized to function effectively even though each member of the democracy possesses incomplete information about the available choices.","Foraging honeybees do not compare food sources [43], nor do they compare the waggle-dances of recruiters at the hive #AUTHOR_TAG.","['Collective decisions are also made in other contexts, such as choice of foraging site.', 'Here again, comparisons of sites by individuals seems to play little role.', 'Foraging honeybees do not compare food sources [43], nor do they compare the waggle-dances of recruiters at the hive #AUTHOR_TAG.', ""Rather, multiple sites 'compete' for foragers, with bees foraging more persistently at high quality sites and recruiting to them more energetically [43,45]."", ""Foragers can also directly inhibit recruitment if they perceive danger at a particular food source by the use of 'stop-signals' directed at bees recruiting to that source [46]."", 'In trail-laying ants and bees, pheromone trails to better foraging sites are more strongly reinforced and this again leads to a collective choice without any necessity for individuals to visit multiple sites [47,48].', 'Just as for nest-site choice, foraging recruitment can either be graded (laying more pheromone to a better food source, e.g.', '[47,49]) or a binary decision (all-or-nothing recruitment, e.g.', '[50,51]).']",1,"['Foraging honeybees do not compare food sources [43], nor do they compare the waggle-dances of recruiters at the hive #AUTHOR_TAG.']"

This systematic review sought to examine the nature of change in alcohol consumption over time in control groups in brief intervention studies. Primary studies were identified from existing reviews published in English language, peer-reviewed journals between 1995 and 2005. Change in alcohol consumption and selected study-level characteristics for each primary study were extracted. Consumption change data were pooled in random effects models and meta-regression was used to explore predictors of change. Eleven review papers reported the results of 44 individual studies. Twenty-six of these studies provided data suitable for quantitative study. Extreme heterogeneity was identified and the extent of observed reduction in consumption over time was greater in studies undertaken in Anglophone countries, with single gender study participants, and without special targeting by age. Heterogeneity was reduced but was still substantial in a sub-set of 15 general population studies undertaken in English language countries. The actual content of the control group procedure itself was not predictive of reduction in drinking, nor were a range of other candidate variables including setting, the exclusion of dependent drinkers, the collection of a biological sample at follow-up, and duration of study.

Two recent articles (Cohen, 1994; Schmidt, 1996) have argued strongly that the long-standing practice of reliance on significance testing is logically indefensible and retards the research enterprise by making it difficult to develop cumulative knowledge. These articles call for replacing significance tests with point estimates and confidence intervals. Articles of this sort have appeared from time to time since the mid-1950s, but the present situation appears to be different in two important respects. For the first time, the American Psychological Association (APA) Board of Scientific Affairs is looking into the possibility of taking the lead in the effort to reform data analysis procedures. In March of 1996, the Board appointed a task force to study the issue and make recommendations, recommendations that presumably will influence journal editors and reviewers.

Qualitative focus group discussion method study applying the deductive framework approach. Six focus groups involving 18 general practitioners and 19 nurses were recruited from primary health care of the City of Tampere, Finland. Possible obstacles are: (1) confusion regarding the content of early-phase heavy drinking, (2) lack of self-efficacy among primary health care professionals, (3) sense of lacking time needed for carrying out brief intervention, (4) not having simple guidelines for brief intervention, (5) sense of difficulty in identifying of early-phase heavy drinkers, and (6) uncertainty about the justification for initiating discussion on alcohol issues with patients. The main actions to be taken to promote brief intervention are to educate professionals about the content of early-phase heavy drinking and to produce directing, but not excessively demanding guidelines for carrying out EIBI. Probably successful personal experiences carrying out EIBI can improve professionals' self-efficacy and give to them final justification for discussion alcohol issues with their patients.","In surveys of health professionals' attitudes to this work, one of the most commonly encountered obstacles is ""lack of time"" or ""too busy"" (32,#AUTHOR_TAG).","['It should be stressed that the importance of these misunderstandings is not limited to academic debates between scientists in learned journals; they could well affect the future provision of ABI in England and perhaps in other countries.', 'It is well known that there have been considerable difficulties in persuading GPs, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to implement ABI routinely in their practices; there is a copious literature on this problem (30) and how it may be redressed (31).', 'In surveys of health professionals\' attitudes to this work, one of the most commonly encountered obstacles is ""lack of time"" or ""too busy"" (32,#AUTHOR_TAG).', 'There has also been resistance in England to the inclusion of ABI in the NHS Quality and Outcomes Framework, under which general practices are reimbursed for preventive activity.', 'This has created considerable pressure on the relevant sections of the Department of Health in London (and now its replacement body for this area of work, Public Health England) to make the interventions that health professionals are being encouraged to implement as short and easy to deliver as possible.', 'So too, given the multitude of demands on their time from a large number of health bodies, it would be expected that many GPs would call for ABI to be whittled down to more manageable forms.', 'In times of austerity, the appeal of shorter, simpler, and less expensive interventions for widespread implementation in practice must be seductive to policy-makers.']",0,"['In surveys of health professionals\' attitudes to this work, one of the most commonly encountered obstacles is ""lack of time"" or ""too busy"" (32,#AUTHOR_TAG).']"

In the last year, GPs had most commonly requested more than 12 blood tests and managed 1-6 patients for alcohol. Reports of these preventive practices were significantly increased from 1999 (P < 0.001). Most felt that problem or dependent drinkers' alcohol issues could be legitimately (88%, 87%) and adequately (78%, 69%) addressed by GPs. However, they had low levels of motivation (42%, 35%), task-related self-esteem (53%, 49%) and job satisfaction (15%, 12%) for this. Busyness (63%) and lack of training (57%) or contractual incentives (48%) were key barriers. Endorsement for government policies on alcohol was very low.Among GPs, there still appears to be a gap between actual practice and potential for preventive work relating to alcohol problems; they report little specific training and a lack of support. Translational work on understanding the evidence-base supporting screening and brief intervention could incentivize intervention against excessive drinking and embedding it into everyday primary care practice.","In surveys of health professionals' attitudes to this work, one of the most commonly encountered obstacles is ""lack of time"" or ""too busy"" (#AUTHOR_TAG,33).","['It should be stressed that the importance of these misunderstandings is not limited to academic debates between scientists in learned journals; they could well affect the future provision of ABI in England and perhaps in other countries.', 'It is well known that there have been considerable difficulties in persuading GPs, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to implement ABI routinely in their practices; there is a copious literature on this problem (30) and how it may be redressed (31).', 'In surveys of health professionals\' attitudes to this work, one of the most commonly encountered obstacles is ""lack of time"" or ""too busy"" (#AUTHOR_TAG,33).', 'There has also been resistance in England to the inclusion of ABI in the NHS Quality and Outcomes Framework, under which general practices are reimbursed for preventive activity.', 'This has created considerable pressure on the relevant sections of the Department of Health in London (and now its replacement body for this area of work, Public Health England) to make the interventions that health professionals are being encouraged to implement as short and easy to deliver as possible.', 'So too, given the multitude of demands on their time from a large number of health bodies, it would be expected that many GPs would call for ABI to be whittled down to more manageable forms.', 'In times of austerity, the appeal of shorter, simpler, and less expensive interventions for widespread implementation in practice must be seductive to policy-makers.']",0,"['In surveys of health professionals\' attitudes to this work, one of the most commonly encountered obstacles is ""lack of time"" or ""too busy"" (#AUTHOR_TAG,33).', 'There has also been resistance in England to the inclusion of ABI in the NHS Quality and Outcomes Framework, under which general practices are reimbursed for preventive activity.', 'This has created considerable pressure on the relevant sections of the Department of Health in London (and now its replacement body for this area of work, Public Health England) to make the interventions that health professionals are being encouraged to implement as short and easy to deliver as possible.']"

To know whether a non-significant result counts against a theory, or if it just indicates data insensitivity, researchers must use one of: power, intervals (such as confidence or credibility intervals), or else an indicator of the relative evidence for one theory over another, such as a Bayes factor. I argue Bayes factors allow theory to be linked to data in a way that overcomes the weaknesses of the other approaches. Specifically, Bayes factors use the data themselves to determine their sensitivity in distinguishing theories (unlike power), and they make use of those aspects of a theory's predictions that are often easiest to specify (unlike power and intervals, which require specifying the minimal interesting value in order to address theory). Bayes factors provide a coherent approach to determining whether non-significant results support a null hypothesis over a theory, or whether the data are just insensitive. They allow accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis to be put on an equal footing.

Morton""]","BACKGROUND: Reductions in drinking among individuals randomised to control groups in brief alcohol intervention trials are common and suggest that asking study participants about their drinking may itself cause them to reduce their consumption. We sought to test the hypothesis that the statistical artefact regression to the mean (RTM) explains part of the reduction in such studies. METHODS: 967 participants in a cohort study of alcohol consumption in New Zealand provided data at baseline and again six months later. We use graphical methods and apply thresholds of 8, 12, 16 and 20 in AUDIT scores to explore RTM. RESULTS: There was a negative association between baseline AUDIT scores and change in AUDIT scores from baseline to six months, which in the absence of bias and confounding, is RTM. Students with lower baseline scores tended to have higher follow-up scores and conversely, those with higher baseline scores tended to have lower follow-up scores. When a threshold score of 8 was used to select a subgroup, the observed mean change was approximately half of that observed without a threshold. The application of higher thresholds produced greater apparent reductions in alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Part of the reduction seen in the control groups of brief alcohol intervention trials is likely to be due to RTM and the amount of change is likely to be greater as the threshold for entry to the trial increases.

OBJECTIVE To appraise evidence on the association of CYP2C19 genotype and clopidogrel response through systematic review and meta-analysis.   DATA SOURCES PubMed and EMBASE from their inception to October 2011.   STUDY SELECTION Studies that reported clopidogrel metabolism, platelet reactivity or clinically relevant outcomes (cardiovascular disease [CVD] events and bleeding), and information on CYP2C19 genotype were included.   DATA EXTRACTION We extracted information on study design, genotyping, and disease outcomes and investigated sources of bias.   RESULTS We retrieved 32 studies of 42,016 patients reporting 3545 CVD events, 579 stent thromboses, and 1413 bleeding events. Six studies were randomized trials (""effect-modification"" design) and the remaining 26 reported individuals exposed to clopidogrel (""treatment-only"" design). In treatment-only analysis, individuals with 1 or more CYP2C19 alleles associated with lower enzyme activity had lower levels of active clopidogrel metabolites, less platelet inhibition, lower risk of bleeding (relative risk [RR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.94; absolute risk reduction of 5-8 events per 1000 individuals), and higher risk of CVD events (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.28; absolute risk increase of 8-12 events per 1000 individuals). However, there was evidence of small-study bias (Harbord test P = .001). When analyses were restricted to studies with 200 or more events, the point estimate was attenuated (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.86-1.09). In effect-modification studies, CYP2C19 genotype was not associated with modification of the effect of clopidogrel on CVD end points or bleeding (P > .05 for interaction for both). Other limitations included selective outcome reporting and potential for genotype misclassification due to problems with the * allele nomenclature for cytochrome enzymes.   CONCLUSION Although there was an association between the CYP2C19 genotype and clopidogrel responsiveness, overall there was no significant association of genotype with cardiovascular events.","Patients with loss of function polymorphism in the CYP2C19 gene are less responsive to clopidogrel [5,6], although the importance of this phenomenon remains controversial #AUTHOR_TAG[8][9][10] and may be limited to the risk of stent thrombosis [11].","['Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular ischemic events after acute coronary syndromes or percutaneous coronary interventions and is recommended in guidelines from the USA [1] and Europe [2].', 'Clopidogrel is an inactive prodrug that undergoes two oxidative steps involving multiple cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes in its bioactivation to its pharmacologically active metabolite.', 'Among them, CYP2C19, a CYP enzyme whose activity is determined genetically, contributes predominantly to this bioactivation [3,4] and modulates the antiplatelet and therapeutic response to clopidogrel.', 'Patients with loss of function polymorphism in the CYP2C19 gene are less responsive to clopidogrel [5,6], although the importance of this phenomenon remains controversial #AUTHOR_TAG[8][9][10] and may be limited to the risk of stent thrombosis [11].']",0,"['Patients with loss of function polymorphism in the CYP2C19 gene are less responsive to clopidogrel [5,6], although the importance of this phenomenon remains controversial #AUTHOR_TAG[8][9][10] and may be limited to the risk of stent thrombosis [11].']"

To compare the potency and specificity of the currently used PPIs (i.e., omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole) as inhibitors of four cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4), we performed in vitro studies using human liver microsomal preparations and recombinant CYP2C19. Sample analysis was done using selected reaction monitoring liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectometry. With several systems for CYP2C19 activity (two marker reactions, S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation and R-omeprazole 5-hydroxylation, tested in either human liver microsomes or recombinant CYP2C19), the five PPIs showed competitive inhibition of CYP2C19 activity with K(i) of 0.4 to 1.5 microM for lansoprazole, 2 to 6 microM for omeprazole, approximately 8 microM for esomeprazole, 14 to 69 microM for pantoprazole, and 17 to 21 microM for rabeprazole. Pantoprazole was a competitive inhibitor of both CYP2C9-catalyzed diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation and CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam 1'-hydroxylation (K(i) of 6 and 22 microM, respectively), which were at least 2 times more potent than the other PPIs. All PPIs were poor inhibitors of CYP2D6-mediated bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation with IC(50) > 200 microM. The inhibitory potency of a nonenzymatically formed product of rabeprazole, rabeprazole thioether, was also investigated and showed potent, competitive inhibition with K(i) values of 6 microM for CYP2C9, 2 to 8 microM for CYP2C19, 12 microM for CYP2D6, and 15 microM for CYP3A4. The inhibitory potency of R-omeprazole on the four studied P450 enzymes was also studied and showed higher inhibitory potency than its S-isomer on CYP2C9 and 2C19 activities.

In the in vitro experiments using cDNA-expressed human P450 isoforms, clopidogrel was metabolized to 2-oxo-clopidogrel, the immediate precursor of its pharmacologically active metabolite. CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19 catalyzed this reaction. In the same system using 2-oxo-clopidogrel as the substrate, detection of the active metabolite of clopidogrel required the addition of glutathione to the system. CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 contributed to the production of the active metabolite. Secondly, the contribution of each P450 involved in both oxidative steps was estimated by using enzyme kinetic parameters. The contribution of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19 to the formation of 2-oxo-clopidogrel was 35.8, 19.4, and 44.9%, respectively. The contribution of CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 to the formation of the active metabolite was 32.9, 6.76, 20.6, and 39.8%, respectively. In the inhibition studies with antibodies and selective chemical inhibitors to P450s, the outcomes obtained by inhibition studies were consistent with the results of P450 contributions in each oxidative step. These studies showed that CYP2C19 contributed substantially to both oxidative steps required in the formation of clopidogrel active metabolite and that CYP3A4 contributed substantially to the second oxidative step.

High on-treatment platelet reactivity to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was observed in selected patients. Multiple studies have now demonstrated a clear association between high on-treatment platelet reactivity to ADP measured by multiple methods and adverse clinical event occurrence.

Twenty of the subjects were wild-type CYP2C19 (*1/*1) homozygotes, while the other 8 subjects were heterozygous for the loss-of-function polymorphism CYP2C19*2 (*1/*2).

JEONG"", ""K. P. BLIDEN"", ""U. S. TANTRY"", ""P. A. GURBEL""]","Recent consensus of the Working Group has suggested that high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) to ADP is a major cardiovascular risk factor [1]. This document also has provided the potential cut-offs of HPR to ADP for the most commonly used platelet function tests (PFTs), including light transmittance aggregometry (LTA), the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay (VerifyNow), Multiplate and the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-phosphorylation (VASP-P) assay. Although the concept of HPR is a major step forward for a personalized antiplatelet therapy strategy in high-risk patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), several issues have been raised and delayed the clinical adoption of PFT [2,3]. The different correlations and degree of agreement between HPR determined by various PFTs are important concerns. Although the various PFTs identify different aspects of platelet biology, several studies have suggested matched cut-offs of HPR measured by LTA, VerifyNow and Multiplate [4,5], strengthening the reliability of the hypothesis of HPR being an important indicator of risk. The higher prevalence of HPR determined by the VASP-P assay in clopidogrelor prasugrel-treated patients (> 50% and 25%, respectively) compared with other assays during clopidogrel therapy (20 40%) [6-10], questions that the consensus-defined cut-off value of > 50% platelet reactivity index (PRI) may be so low that the true proportion of high-risk patients for ischemic events is overestimated [2,3]. If we keep in mind the relatively low rate of post-PCI ischemic events, an estimation of HPR exceeding 50% during clopidogrel therapy may cause unnecessary application of potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitors with an attendant increased risk of bleeding. We therefore performed the current pharmacodynamic analysis to determine the agreement for the definition and the prevalence of HPR among various PFTs in patients with stable coronary artery disease treated with dual antiplatelet therapy [6]. Platelet function measurements from two prospective randomized studies [6] were used in this analysis; 37 and 39 patients were enrolled from our institution and treated with ticagrelor (180-mg loading-dose [LD] and 90-mg twice a day maintenance-dose [MD]) and clopidogrel (600-mg LD and 75mg d MD), respectively. Serial LTA, VerifyNow and VASPP assays were performed, and a total of 1002 matched pairs (ticagrelor = 498 pairs; clopidogrel = 504 pairs) were available for this analysis. The overall inter-assay correlation and receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis determined by the level of platelet inhibition were consistent irrespective of clopidogrel or ticagrelor administration. The LTA values correlated most with VerifyNow (Fig. 1A, r = 0.821) and less well with the VASP-P assay (Fig. 1B, r = 0.688). PRI values in low/ medium responsive patients were more scattered compared with LTAmeasurements, a finding that is in line with previous observations [11,12]. The frequency ofHPR (based on consensus-defined cut-offs) was the greatest by VASP-P PRI (47.5%) compared with 5 lM ADP-induced aggregation > 46% (37.3%) and P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) > 235 (40.0%). A PRU cut-off > 235 showed substantial agreement with > 46% LTA cut-off (j = 0.737; concordance, 87.5%; balanced distribution of discordance) (Fig. 1A). The VASP-P PRI cut-off showed moderate agreement with the LTA cut-off (j = 0.585; concordance, 79.6%; relatively unbalanced distribution of discordance) (Fig. 1B). ROC curve analysis was used to assess the corresponding points to 5 lM ADP-induced aggregation > 46%, PRU > 234 and VASP-P PRI > 60% (Fig. 1C, D). When the new HPR criteria of a VASP PRI > 60% were applied, the agreement with the LTA cut-off improved (j = 0.634; concordance, 82.6%; narrowed discordance) (Fig. 1B: green arrow and numbers).

The antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel is commonly assessed by measuring the aggregatory response to 5 mM ADP by light transmission aggregation (LTA) or multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) or by the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein platelet reactivity index (VASP-PRI). To determine which of these three tests of platelet ADP receptor pathway inhibition most closely correlates with clopidogrel AM levels. We analyzed blood samples from 82 patients with coronary artery disease who were randomized to receive double-dose or standard dose clopidogrel for 2 weeks. We measured peak clopidogrel AM levels, platelet aggregation in response to ADP and VASP-PRI on days 1, and repeated all the measures on days 7 and 14. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the correlation between clopidogrel AM and LTA, MEA and VASP-PRI. Bland-Altman plots were used to explore the agreement between tests of the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel. Clopidogrel AM on day 1 correlated most closely with VASP-PRI (r = -0.5767) and demonstrated weaker correlations with LTA (r = -0.4656) and MEA (r = -0.3384) (all p < 0.01). Intra-class correlation (ICC) between VASP-PRI and LTA was 0.6446; VASP-PRI and MEA was 0.4720; and LTA and MEA was 0.4693. Similar results were obtained on days 7 and 14. Commonly used pharmacodynamic measures of clopidogrel response are only moderately correlated with clopidogrel AM levels and may not be suitable to measure the adequacy of clopidogrel therapy.","This test -also referred to as the VASP index -specifically assesses the activity of the P2Y12 receptor [31] (the target of clopidogrel antiplatelet action), and is widely used for monitoring the responsiveness to clopidogrel [32,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['The primary test to assess platelet function was based on the VASP phosphorylation level measured in whole blood using a flow cytometric assay (Platelet VASP ® ; Diagnostica Stago, Biocytex, Asnières, France) and a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France).', 'Results were expressed as platelet reactivity index (PRI%), calculated from the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of samples incubated with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) alone or with both PGE1 and ADP simultaneously, using the following formula: (MFI PGE1 -MFI PGE1+ADP /MFI PGE1 ) × 100, as previously described [3].', 'This test -also referred to as the VASP index -specifically assesses the activity of the P2Y12 receptor [31] (the target of clopidogrel antiplatelet action), and is widely used for monitoring the responsiveness to clopidogrel [32,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'The percentage change in PRI on study day 7 just before the last administration of study drugs relative to baseline, i.e. prior to drug administrations (percentage change in PRI [%] D7H0), was used as the primary study endpoint.', 'PRI (%) relative to day 1 was also calculated for D7H4.']",5,"['This test -also referred to as the VASP index -specifically assesses the activity of the P2Y12 receptor [31] (the target of clopidogrel antiplatelet action), and is widely used for monitoring the responsiveness to clopidogrel [32,#AUTHOR_TAG].']"

Methods: Twenty-four subjects were given oral doses of 100 mg caffeine, 25 mg losartan, 20 mg omeprazole, 10 mg debrisoquin, and 250 mg quinine on separate days. After a washout period of at least 4 days, all drugs were given simultaneously except for quinine, which was given 8 hours after the other drugs. Blood and urine samples were collected to determine parent drug and metabolite concentrations for assessment of phenotyping indices. Any difference between both single and cocktail doses was tested on a log-normal distribution. Results: The phenotypic indices of CYP1A2 (paraxanthine/caffeine in 4-hour plasma), CYP2C9 (losartan/E-3174 [metabolite of losartan] in 0- to 8-hour urine), CYP2C19 (omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole in 3-hour plasma), and CYP3A4 (quinine/3-hydroxyquinine in 16-hour plasma) were not significantly changed when probe drugs were administered alone compared with together, although a tendency toward higher concentrations of losartan was seen during simultaneous administration (95% confidence interval, 0.51-1.002; P =.051). The CYP2D6 phenotypic index (debrisoquin/4-hydroxydebrisoquin in 0- to 8-hour urine) was significantly changed when drugs were given together (95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.87; P =.007), indicating an inhibition of the debrisoquin metabolism. The within-subject coefficients of variation (8%-25%) were much lower than the between-subject coefficients of variation (34%-79%). Conclusions: The administration of drugs together suggests an inhibition of debrisoquin metabolism caused by the concurrent drugs given. By separating debrisoquin from the other cocktail drugs, this method is likely to be used as a tool to phenotype the enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 with only 2 urinary collections and 2 blood-sampling occasions.",The molar omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole metabolic ratio in plasma samples at 3 hours was calculated as an index of CYP2C19 activity [34]#AUTHOR_TAG[36].,"['The molar omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole metabolic ratio in plasma samples at 3 hours was calculated as an index of CYP2C19 activity [34]#AUTHOR_TAG[36].', 'In one EM subject, this ratio was calculated from the blood sample taken at 4 hours because 5-hydroxyomeprazole was not detectable at 3 hours.']",5,['The molar omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole metabolic ratio in plasma samples at 3 hours was calculated as an index of CYP2C19 activity [34]#AUTHOR_TAG[36].']

The study was nonrandomized and included seven subjects previously classified as poor metabolizers (PM) of S-mephenytoin. The ratio between the plasma concentrations of omeprazole and hydroxyomeprazole (metabolic ratio; MR) was determined by HPLC in a blood sample drawn 3 h after drug intake. In 17 subjects the test was repeated and the MRs of omeprazole on the two occasions were correlated (rs = 0.85; p < 0.0001). There was a significant correlation between the MR of omeprazole and the S/R mephenytoin ratio among 141 subjects, in whom both ratios were determined (rs = 0.63, p < 0.001). All seven PMs of S-mephenytoin had higher MRs of omeprazole (7.1-23.8) than extensive metabolizers (EM) (0.1-4.9). All 160 subjects and another 15 Caucasian Swedish PMs previously phenotyped with mephenytoin were analysed with respect to the presence of the CYP2C19m1 allele by PCR amplification of the intron 4/exon 5 junction followed by Sma I digestion. EMs heterozygous for the CYP2C19m1 gene had MRs of omeprazole and S/R ratios of mephenytoin that were higher than those of subjects who were homozygous for the wild-type allele (p = 0.0001). Nineteen of the 22 PMs were homozygous for the CYP2C19m1 gene. Three were heterozygous for this allele. Thus, 41 of the 44 alleles (93%) of PMs were defective CYP2C19m1.

In reviewing this evidence and its clinical impact, the writing group believed it would be more appropriate to expand the title of this guideline to ""Secondary Prevention and Risk Reduction Therapy for Patients With Coronary and Other Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease."" Indeed, the growing body of evidence confirms that in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, comprehensive risk factor management reduces risk as assessed by a variety of outcomes, including improved survival, reduced recurrent events, the need for revascularization procedures, and improved quality of life. It is important not only that the healthcare provider implement these recommendations in appropriate patients but also that healthcare systems support this implementation to maximize the benefit to the patient. Compelling evidence-based results from recent clinical trials and revised practice guidelines provide the impetus for this update of the 2006 recommendations with evidence-based results (2-165) (Table 1). Classification of recommendations and level of evidence are expressed in ACCF/AHA format, as detailed in Table 2. Recommendations made herein are largely based on major practice guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and updated ACCF/AHA practice guidelines, as well as on results from recent clinical trials. Thus, the development of the present guideline involved a process of partial adaptation of other guideline statements and reports and supplemental literature searches.

There are, however, few data concerning high on-treatment platelet reactivity to both aspirin and clopidogrel simultaneously. The aim of the present study was to determine the incidence of dual high on-treatment platelet reactivity (DAPR) and its impact on clinical outcome.On-treatment platelet reactivity was measured in parallel by ADP- and arachidonic acid-induced light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) (n=921) and the point-of-care VerifyNow system (P2Y12 and aspirin) (n=422) in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy undergoing elective stent implantation. HCPR and HAPR were established by receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis and ischaemic stroke at 1-year follow-up.The incidence of DAPR varied between 14.7% and 26.9% depending on the platelet function test used. DAPR, assessed by LTA and the VerifyNow system, was highly associated with an adverse clinical outcome. At 1-year follow-up the primary endpoint occurred more frequently in patients with isolated HCPR (11.7%), isolated HAPR (9.6%) or DAPR (10.7%) compared with patients without high on-treatment platelet reactivity (4.2%, all p<0.01) when platelet function was evaluated with LTA. Using the VerifyNow system, patients exhibiting DAPR had the highest risk for the primary endpoint (17.7% vs 4.1% in patients without high on-treatment platelet reactivity, p=0.001).In patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention, DAPR to aspirin and clopidogrel is present in one in five patients and is associated with a high risk for atherothrombotic events.

However, PPIs may inhibit CYP2C19, potentially reducing the effectiveness of clopidogrel.MethodsA randomized, open-label, 2-period, crossover study of healthy subjects (n = 160, age 18 to 55 years, homozygous for CYP2C19 extensive metabolizer genotype, confined, standardized diet) was conducted. Clopidogrel 75 mg with or without a PPI (dexlansoprazole 60 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg, esomeprazole 40 mg, or, as a positive control to maximize potential interaction and demonstrate assay sensitivity, omeprazole 80 mg) was given daily for 9 days. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were assessed on days 9 and 10. Pharmacodynamic end-points were vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein P2Y12 platelet reactivity index, maximal platelet aggregation to 5 and 20 mmol/l adenosine diphosphate, and VerifyNow P2Y12 platelet response units.ResultsPharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses with omeprazole demonstrated assay sensitivity. The area under the curve for clopidogrel active metabolite decreased significantly with esomeprazole but not with dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole. Similarly, esomeprazole but not dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole significantly reduced the effect of clopidogrel on vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein platelet reactivity index. All PPIs decreased the peak plasma concentration of clopidogrel active metabolite (omeprazole > esomeprazole > lansoprazole > dexlansoprazole) and showed a corresponding order of potency for effects on maximal platelet aggregation and platelet response units.ConclusionsGeneration of clopidogrel active metabolite and inhibition of platelet function were reduced less by the coadministration of dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole with clopidogrel than by the coadministration of esomeprazole or omeprazole. These results suggest that the potential of PPIs to attenuate the efficacy of clopidogrel could be minimized by the use of dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole rather than esomeprazole or omeprazole.

We conclude that the metabolism of two proton pump inhibitors is under coregulatory control of S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C19), but that the magnitude of CYP2C19-mediated metabolism appears to differ between the two drugs. In contrast to omeprazole, the metabolism of E3810 is less saturable in extensive metabolizers during the repetitive dosings.","Rabeprazole is mainly metabolized by nonenzymatic reduction to rabeprazole thioether [41] and is a less potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 than omeprazole [14,#AUTHOR_TAG,43].","['As expected [22,23], CYP2C19 genotype and activity influenced clopidogrel antiplatelet activity in the absence of PPI, with greater inhibition of platelet aggregation in homozygous EM subjects compared with subjects with at least one non-functional CYP2C19 allele.', 'Also, during the placebo study period, clopidogrel-induced change in VASP index and platelet aggregation induced by 10 M (but not 20 M) ADP correlated with CYP2C19 activity, as assessed by the use of the omeprazole metabolic ratio.', 'However, the association was weak, with only about 18% of antiplatelet effect explained by the omeprazole metabolic ratio.', 'During PPI administrations, no significant correlation was found between the change in VASP index or the change in the AUC of clopidogrel active metabolite and CYP2C19 activity as assessed by the omeprazole metabolic ratio.', 'Such an absence of association by regression analysis raises the question of the role of CYP2C19 inhibition in explaining our findings.', 'Rabeprazole is mainly metabolized by nonenzymatic reduction to rabeprazole thioether [41] and is a less potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 than omeprazole [14,#AUTHOR_TAG,43].', 'This may explain why rabeprazole had less effect than omeprazole on the clopidogrel-induced change in VASP index, although the study was not powered to test the statistical significance of this difference.', 'However, this does not explain the similarity of the pharmacokinetic interaction of clopidogrel active metabolite with both PPIs.', 'In this respect, pantoprazole [19] and rabeprazole appear to have similar profiles.', 'Also, rabeprazole thioether, the main circulating metabolite of rabeprazole, is a CYP2C19 inhibitor [14] and could have contributed to the observed effects.', 'Finally, CYP2C19 is not the only CYP that contributes to the bioactivation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite [4].', 'CYP2C19 contributes to the first step of clopidogrel metabolism to its 2-oxo unstable metabolite by 45% while CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 contribute by 36% and 19%, respectively.', 'CYP2C19 contributes to the final step of clopidogrel active metabolite formation from 2-oxoclopidogrel by only 20% while CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 contribute by 40%, 33% and 7%, respectively [4].', 'It is therefore conceivable that non-CYP2C19-mediated mechanisms may contribute to the interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel.']",4,"['Rabeprazole is mainly metabolized by nonenzymatic reduction to rabeprazole thioether [41] and is a less potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 than omeprazole [14,#AUTHOR_TAG,43].']"

Data sources: Literature retrieval was accessed through PubMed (1980-January 2009), abstracts from 2008 American Heart Association and 2009 Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions Scientific Sessions, and media press releases using the terms clopidogrel, proton pump inhibitors, cytochrome 2C19, genetic cytochrome P450 polymorphisms, and drug interaction. In addition, reference citations from publications identified in the search were reviewed. Study selection and data extraction: Relevant original research articles and review articles were evaluated. Articles were selected if they were published in English and focused on any of the key words or appeared to have substantial content addressing the drug interaction. Data synthesis: Recent attention has been placed on a potential interaction observed between clopidogrel and the widely used PPIs. Preliminary evidence suggests that omeprazole interacts with clopidogrel, reducing clopidogrel's antiplatelet effects as measured by various laboratory tests. Most data indicate that the interaction involves the competitive inhibition of the CYP2C19 isoenzyme. The interaction appears to be clinically significant, as several retrospective analyses have shown an increase in adverse cardiovascular outcomes when PPIs and clopidogrel are used concomitantly. However, this may not be a class effect. Conclusions: Available data suggest that omeprazole is the PPI most likely to have a significant interaction with clopidogrel. Further studies are needed to determine that an interaction between the other PPIs and clopidogrel does not exist. In situations in which both clopidogrel and a PPI are indicated, pantoprazole should be used since it is the PPI least likely to interact with clopidogrel.","Rabeprazole is mainly metabolized by nonenzymatic reduction to rabeprazole thioether [41] and is a less potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 than omeprazole [14,#AUTHOR_TAG,43].","['As expected [22,23], CYP2C19 genotype and activity influenced clopidogrel antiplatelet activity in the absence of PPI, with greater inhibition of platelet aggregation in homozygous EM subjects compared with subjects with at least one non-functional CYP2C19 allele.', 'Also, during the placebo study period, clopidogrel-induced change in VASP index and platelet aggregation induced by 10 M (but not 20 M) ADP correlated with CYP2C19 activity, as assessed by the use of the omeprazole metabolic ratio.', 'However, the association was weak, with only about 18% of antiplatelet effect explained by the omeprazole metabolic ratio.', 'During PPI administrations, no significant correlation was found between the change in VASP index or the change in the AUC of clopidogrel active metabolite and CYP2C19 activity as assessed by the omeprazole metabolic ratio.', 'Such an absence of association by regression analysis raises the question of the role of CYP2C19 inhibition in explaining our findings.', 'Rabeprazole is mainly metabolized by nonenzymatic reduction to rabeprazole thioether [41] and is a less potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 than omeprazole [14,#AUTHOR_TAG,43].', 'This may explain why rabeprazole had less effect than omeprazole on the clopidogrel-induced change in VASP index, although the study was not powered to test the statistical significance of this difference.', 'However, this does not explain the similarity of the pharmacokinetic interaction of clopidogrel active metabolite with both PPIs.', 'In this respect, pantoprazole [19] and rabeprazole appear to have similar profiles.', 'Also, rabeprazole thioether, the main circulating metabolite of rabeprazole, is a CYP2C19 inhibitor [14] and could have contributed to the observed effects.', 'Finally, CYP2C19 is not the only CYP that contributes to the bioactivation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite [4].', 'CYP2C19 contributes to the first step of clopidogrel metabolism to its 2-oxo unstable metabolite by 45% while CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 contribute by 36% and 19%, respectively.', 'CYP2C19 contributes to the final step of clopidogrel active metabolite formation from 2-oxoclopidogrel by only 20% while CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 contribute by 40%, 33% and 7%, respectively [4].', 'It is therefore conceivable that non-CYP2C19-mediated mechanisms may contribute to the interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel.']",4,"['As expected [22,23], CYP2C19 genotype and activity influenced clopidogrel antiplatelet activity in the absence of PPI, with greater inhibition of platelet aggregation in homozygous EM subjects compared with subjects with at least one non-functional CYP2C19 allele.', 'Also, during the placebo study period, clopidogrel-induced change in VASP index and platelet aggregation induced by 10 M (but not 20 M) ADP correlated with CYP2C19 activity, as assessed by the use of the omeprazole metabolic ratio.', 'However, the association was weak, with only about 18% of antiplatelet effect explained by the omeprazole metabolic ratio.', 'During PPI administrations, no significant correlation was found between the change in VASP index or the change in the AUC of clopidogrel active metabolite and CYP2C19 activity as assessed by the omeprazole metabolic ratio.', 'Rabeprazole is mainly metabolized by nonenzymatic reduction to rabeprazole thioether [41] and is a less potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 than omeprazole [14,#AUTHOR_TAG,43].', 'This may explain why rabeprazole had less effect than omeprazole on the clopidogrel-induced change in VASP index, although the study was not powered to test the statistical significance of this difference.', 'However, this does not explain the similarity of the pharmacokinetic interaction of clopidogrel active metabolite with both PPIs.', 'In this respect, pantoprazole [19] and rabeprazole appear to have similar profiles.', 'Also, rabeprazole thioether, the main circulating metabolite of rabeprazole, is a CYP2C19 inhibitor [14] and could have contributed to the observed effects.', 'Finally, CYP2C19 is not the only CYP that contributes to the bioactivation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite [4].', 'CYP2C19 contributes to the first step of clopidogrel metabolism to its 2-oxo unstable metabolite by 45% while CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 contribute by 36% and 19%, respectively.', 'CYP2C19 contributes to the final step of clopidogrel active metabolite formation from 2-oxoclopidogrel by only 20% while CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 contribute by 40%, 33% and 7%, respectively [4].', 'It is therefore conceivable that non-CYP2C19-mediated mechanisms may contribute to the interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel.']"
CCT88,82218905,Effects of rabeprazole on the antiplatelet effects and pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel in healthy volunteers,Christian Funck-Brentano,Drug-Drug Interaction Profiles of Proton Pump Inhibitors,"[""Ryuichi Ogawa"", ""Hirotoshi Echizen""]","Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed for the treatment of gastric acid-related disorders and the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. In addition, they are routinely prescribed for the prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving a dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of clopidogrel and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) after myocardial infarction or percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting. Because PPIs are given to these patients for long periods, there is a concern about the potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with concomitantly administered medications. Because PPIs give rise to profound and long-lasting elevation of intragastric pH, it is not surprising that they interfere with the absorption of concurrent medications. Drug solubility may be substantially reduced at neutral pH compared with acidic conditions. In this context, PPIs have been shown to reduce the bioavailability of many clinically relevant drugs (e.g. ketoconazole, atazanavir) by 50% or more compared with the control values. Soon after the introduction of omeprazole (a prototype PPI) into the market, it was reported that omeprazole was associated with 30% and 10% reductions in systemic clearance of diazepam and phenytoin, respectively. In vitro studies demonstrating the inhibitory effects of omeprazole on the metabolism of these drugs with human liver microsomes gave a mechanistic explanation for the DDIs. Numerous subsequent studies have been performed to investigate the DDI potential of PPIs associated with the metabolic inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activities; however, most such attempts have failed to find clinically relevant results. Nevertheless, recent large-scale clinical trials have raised concerns about possible DDIs between PPIs and an antiplatelet drug, clopidogrel. It has been suggested that coadministration of PPIs with a dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of clopidogrel and aspirin may attenuate the anti-aggregation effects of those medications and augment the risk of cardiovascular ischaemic events. There is a possibility that PPIs may elicit detrimental effects by inhibiting CYP2C19-dominated metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite. Further studies are urgently required to clarify the mechanism of this DDI and to explore new aspects of the DDI potential of PPIs.","Rabeprazole is mainly metabolized by nonenzymatic reduction to rabeprazole thioether [41] and is a less potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 than omeprazole [14,42,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['As expected [22,23], CYP2C19 genotype and activity influenced clopidogrel antiplatelet activity in the absence of PPI, with greater inhibition of platelet aggregation in homozygous EM subjects compared with subjects with at least one non-functional CYP2C19 allele.', 'Also, during the placebo study period, clopidogrel-induced change in VASP index and platelet aggregation induced by 10 M (but not 20 M) ADP correlated with CYP2C19 activity, as assessed by the use of the omeprazole metabolic ratio.', 'However, the association was weak, with only about 18% of antiplatelet effect explained by the omeprazole metabolic ratio.', 'During PPI administrations, no significant correlation was found between the change in VASP index or the change in the AUC of clopidogrel active metabolite and CYP2C19 activity as assessed by the omeprazole metabolic ratio.', 'Such an absence of association by regression analysis raises the question of the role of CYP2C19 inhibition in explaining our findings.', 'Rabeprazole is mainly metabolized by nonenzymatic reduction to rabeprazole thioether [41] and is a less potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 than omeprazole [14,42,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'This may explain why rabeprazole had less effect than omeprazole on the clopidogrel-induced change in VASP index, although the study was not powered to test the statistical significance of this difference.', 'However, this does not explain the similarity of the pharmacokinetic interaction of clopidogrel active metabolite with both PPIs.', 'In this respect, pantoprazole [19] and rabeprazole appear to have similar profiles.', 'Also, rabeprazole thioether, the main circulating metabolite of rabeprazole, is a CYP2C19 inhibitor [14] and could have contributed to the observed effects.', 'Finally, CYP2C19 is not the only CYP that contributes to the bioactivation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite [4].', 'CYP2C19 contributes to the first step of clopidogrel metabolism to its 2-oxo unstable metabolite by 45% while CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 contribute by 36% and 19%, respectively.', 'CYP2C19 contributes to the final step of clopidogrel active metabolite formation from 2-oxoclopidogrel by only 20% while CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 contribute by 40%, 33% and 7%, respectively [4].', 'It is therefore conceivable that non-CYP2C19-mediated mechanisms may contribute to the interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel.']",4,"['Rabeprazole is mainly metabolized by nonenzymatic reduction to rabeprazole thioether [41] and is a less potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 than omeprazole [14,42,#AUTHOR_TAG].']"

On-treatment platelet reactivity was measured in parallel by light transmittance aggregometry, Verify Now P2Y12 and Platelet works assays, and the IMPACT-R and the platelet function analysis system (PFA-100) (with the Dade PFA collagen/adenosine diphosphate (ADP) cartridge and Innovance PFA P2Y). Cutoff values for high on-treatment platelet reactivity were established by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Main Outcome Measurement The primary end point was defined as a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and ischemic stroke. The primary safety end point included TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) criteria major and minor bleeding. Results Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that at 1-year follow-up, the primary end point occurred more frequently in patients with high on-treatment platelet reactivity when assessed by light transmittance aggregometry (52 [11.7%; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 8.9%-15.0%] vs 36 [6.0%;95%CI, 4.2%-8.2%] P.001; n=1049),Verify Now (54 [13.3%; 95% CI, 10.2%-17.0%] vs 37 [5.7%; 95% CI, 4.1%-7.8%]P.001; n=1052), Platelet works (33 [12.6%; 95% CI, 8.8%-17.2%] vs 21 [6.1%;95% CI, 3.8%-9.2%] P=.005; n=606), and Innovance PFA P2Y (18 [12.2%; 95%CI; 7.4%-18.6%] vs 28 [6.3%; 95% CI, 4.3%-8.9%] P=.02; n=588). ROC-curve analysis demonstrated that light transmittance aggregometry (area under the curve[AUC], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.58-0.68), Verify Now (AUC, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.57-0.67), and Platelet works (AUC, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.53-0.69) had modest ability to discriminate between patients with and without primary end point at 1-year follow-up. The IMPACT-R(n=905) and the Siemens PFA Collagen/ADP (n=812) were unable to discriminate between patients with and without the primary end point at 1-year follow-up (all AUCs included 0.50 in the CI). None of the tests identified patients at risk for bleeding. Conclusions Of the platelet function tests assessed, light transmittance aggregometry,Verify Now, Platelet works, and Innovance PFA P2Y were significantly associated with the primary end point. However, the predictive accuracy of these 4 tests was only modest. None of the tests provided accurate prognostic information to identify patients at higher risk of bleeding following stent implantation.","The VASP index is considered as a specific test for evaluating P2Y12 inhibition, while light-transmission aggregometry is used to predict outcome during dual  antiplatelet therapy, although both tests have a predictive value [31,33,#AUTHOR_TAG,40].","['As an inhibitory interaction is not expected to occur in subjects who do not have an adequate response in the absence of inhibitor, the predefined group of VASP good antiplatelet responders was chosen to examine the pharmacodynamic interactions between rabeprazole and clopidogrel.', 'The VASP index is considered as a specific test for evaluating P2Y12 inhibition, while light-transmission aggregometry is used to predict outcome during dual  antiplatelet therapy, although both tests have a predictive value [31,33,#AUTHOR_TAG,40].', 'In the group of good VASP antiplatelet responders, the clopidogrel antiplatelet effect remained non-inferior to placebo at D7H0 and D7H4 during rabeprazole co-administration, whereas it crossed the limit of noninferiority during omeprazole co-administration.', 'Therefore, from a pharmacodynamic point of view, in subjects in whom clopidogrel elicits a marked antiplatelet effect, inhibition of clopidogrel antiplatelet action is minimal with rabeprazole, whereas a statistically significant reversal of clopidogrel effects is observed with omeprazole.']",0,"['The VASP index is considered as a specific test for evaluating P2Y12 inhibition, while light-transmission aggregometry is used to predict outcome during dual  antiplatelet therapy, although both tests have a predictive value [31,33,#AUTHOR_TAG,40].']"

Attenuating effects on platelet response to clopidogrel have been reported solely for the PPI omeprazole. PPIs differ in their metabolisation properties as well as their potential for drug-drug interactions. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of different PPIs (pantoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole) on platelet response to clopidogrel in patients with previous coronary stent placement under chronic clopidogrel treatment. In a cross-sectional observational study, consecutive patients under clopidogrel maintenance treatment (n = 1,000) scheduled for a control coronary angiography were enrolled. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation (in AU*min) was measured with multiple electrode platelet aggregometry (MEA). From the entire study population, 268 (26.8%) patients were under PPI treatment at the time point of platelet function testing (pantoprazole, n = 162; omeprazole, n = 64; esomeprazole, n = 42). Platelet aggregation (median [interquartile range]) was significantly higher in patients with omeprazole treatment (295.5 [193.5-571.2] AU*min) compared to patients without PPI treatment (220.0 [143.8-388.8] AU*min; p = 0.001).

Attenuating effects of concomitant PPI treatment on platelet response to clopidogrel were restricted to the use of omeprazole. No attenuating effects on platelet response to clopidogrel were observed for pantoprazole or esomeprazole.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are believed to decrease the risk of such complications, though no randomized trial has proved this in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. Recently, concerns have been raised about the potential for PPIs to blunt the efficacy of clopidogrel. Methods: We randomly assigned patients with an indication for dual antiplatelet therapy to receive clopidogrel in combination with either omeprazole or placebo, in addition to aspirin. The primary gastrointestinal end point was a composite of overt or occult bleeding, symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers or erosions, obstruction, or perforation. The primary cardiovascular end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, or stroke. The trial was terminated prematurely when the sponsor lost financing. Results: We planned to enroll about 5000 patients; a total of 3873 were randomly assigned and 3761 were included in analyses. In all, 51 patients had a gastrointestinal event; the event rate was 1.1% with omeprazole and 2.9% with placebo at 180 days (hazard ratio with omeprazole, 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.63; P<0.001). The rate of overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding was also reduced with omeprazole as compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.56; P = 0.001). A total of 109 patients had a cardiovascular event, with event rates of 4.9% with omeprazole and 5.7% with placebo (hazard ratio with omeprazole, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.44; P = 0.96); high-risk subgroups did not show significant heterogeneity. The two groups did not differ significantly in the rate of serious adverse events, though the risk of diarrhea was increased with omeprazole. Conclusions: Among patients receiving aspirin and clopidogrel, prophylactic use of a PPI reduced the rate of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. There was no apparent cardiovascular interaction between clopidogrel and omeprazole, but our results do not rule out a clinically meaningful difference in cardiovascular events due to use of a PPI.","Whether this occurs with all PPIs or is even of significant amplitude with omeprazole remains a matter of debate [9,[24][25][26][27]#AUTHOR_TAG[29].","['Concerns about PPI and clopidogrel interaction were raised when omeprazole was found to inhibit the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel in an in vivo study of 124 patients undergoing elective coronary stent implantation [21].', 'Several studies have suggested that omeprazole interacts with clopidogrel efficacy by inhibiting the formation of its active metabolite via CYP2C19 inhibition [22,23].', 'Whether this occurs with all PPIs or is even of significant amplitude with omeprazole remains a matter of debate [9,[24][25][26][27]#AUTHOR_TAG[29].', 'However, it was recently demonstrated that generation of clopidogrel active metabolite and inhibition of platelet function are reduced less by the co-administration of dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole with clopidogrel than by the co-administration of esomeprazole or omeprazole [30].']",4,"['Concerns about PPI and clopidogrel interaction were raised when omeprazole was found to inhibit the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel in an in vivo study of 124 patients undergoing elective coronary stent implantation [21].', 'Several studies have suggested that omeprazole interacts with clopidogrel efficacy by inhibiting the formation of its active metabolite via CYP2C19 inhibition [22,23].', 'Whether this occurs with all PPIs or is even of significant amplitude with omeprazole remains a matter of debate [9,[24][25][26][27]#AUTHOR_TAG[29].', 'However, it was recently demonstrated that generation of clopidogrel active metabolite and inhibition of platelet function are reduced less by the co-administration of dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole with clopidogrel than by the co-administration of esomeprazole or omeprazole [30].']"

Clopidogrel, a thienopyridine, is a prodrug that is transformed in vivo to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The genes encoding CYP enzymes are polymorphic. Recent data demonstrated patients carrying a genetic variant of CYP enzymes (e.g. CYP2C19) would have a higher rate of ischemic events than non-carriers due to an attenuation of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to clopidogrel. Furthermore, concomitant gastrointestinal ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is commonly prescribed to patients because of the increased risk of bleeding with dual antiplatelet therapy. PPIs are extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and have been associated with decreased antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel.

This nominally significant odds ratio was subject to considerable bias across the studies (small study effect bias and replication diversity). The adjustment for these quality modifiers tended to abolish the association.

In addition, high on-treatment platelet reactivity has been associated with recurrent ischemic events. Whether or not the pharmacological interaction between clopidogrel and PPI, which results in diminished antiplatelet effect, adversely influences clinical efficacy is highly controversial and the subject of debate. Based on largely anecdotal post-hoc analyses, the U.S. Federal Drug Administration's and European Medicines Agency's recommendations discourage PPI use (particularly omeprazole) in patients treated with clopidogrel.

Methods: A comparative pharmacokinetic study with each PPI was designed as an open, randomized, and crossover study of 18 Japanese healthy volunteers who were classified into the homozygous, heterozygous extensive metabolizer and the poor metabolizer based on the CYP2C19 genotype determined by PCR-RFLP method. Each subject received a single oral dose of 20 mg omeprazole, 30 mg lansoprazole, or 20 mg sodium rabeprazole, with at least 1 week washout period between treatments. Plasma concentrations of PPIs and their metabolites were monitored until 12 h after medication. Results: Pharmacokinetic profiles of omeprazole and lansoprazole were well correlated with the CYP2C19 genotype. The heterozygous extensive metabolizer was slightly different from the homozygote, but there was no statistically significant difference. The CYP2C19 genotype dependence found for lansoprazole was not obvious compared with omeprazole. As for rabeprazole, the pharmacokinetic profile was independent of the CYP2C19 genotype.

In different populations three phenotypes have been identified: extensive metabolizers, poor metabolizers and individuals carrying one wild type and one mutant allele (het extensive metabolizers). Systemic exposure to the proton pump inhibitors as expressed by the AUC (area under the plasma level time profiles) is 5-12-times higher in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers. As the pharmacodynamic response (elevation of intragastric pH) to the proton pump inhibitors is related directly to their AUC, a much higher pH can be monitored over 24 hr in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers. Furthermore, clinical efficacy of all proton pump inhibitors depend on maintaining intragastric pH above certain threshold levels and significantly higher eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori have been observed in patients of the poor metabolizers and het extensive metabolizers phenotype if compared to extensive metabolizers. Likewise, limited data suggest that proton pump inhibitors-induced healing rates in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease are apparently higher in poor metabolizers/het extensive metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers of CYP2C19.

Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies suggest that the right anterior superior parietal (r-aSPL) and the right posterior superior parietal lobule (r-pSPL) have opposite roles in triggering perceptual reversals. It has been proposed that these two areas are part of a hierarchical network whose dynamics determine perceptual switches. However, how these two parietal regions interact with each other and with the rest of the brain during bistable perception is not known. Here, we investigated such a model by recording brain activity using fMRI while participants viewed a bistable structure-from-motion stimulus. Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we found that resolving such perceptual ambiguity was specifically associated with reciprocal interactions between these parietal regions and V5/MT. Strikingly, the strength of bottom-up coupling between V5/MT to r-pSPL and from r-pSPL to r-aSPL predicted individual mean dominance duration. Our findings are consistent with a hierarchical predictive coding model of parietal involvement in bistable perception and suggest that visual information processing underlying spontaneous perceptual switches can be described as changes in connectivity strength between parietal and visual cortical regions.

Pearson"", ""R. van Ee"", ""R. Blake""]","When sensory input allows for multiple, competing perceptual interpretations, observers' perception can fluctuate over time, which is called bistable perception. Imaging studies in humans have revealed transient responses in a right-lateralized network in the frontal-parietal cortex (rFPC) around the time of perceptual transitions between interpretations, potentially reflecting the neural initiation of transitions. We investigated the role of this activity in male human observers, with specific interest in its relation to the temporal structure of transitions, which can be either instantaneous or prolonged by periods during which observers experience a mix of both perceptual interpretations. Using both bistable apparent motion and binocular rivalry, we show that transition-related rFPC activity is larger for transitions that last longer, suggesting that rFPC remains active as long as a transition lasts. We also replicate earlier findings that rFPC activity during binocular rivalry transitions exceeds activity during yoked transitions that are simulated using video replay. However, we show that this established finding holds only when perceptual transitions are replayed as instantaneous events. When replay, instead, depicts transitions with the actual durations reported during rivalry, yoked transitions and genuine rivalry transitions elicit equal activity. Together, our results are consistent with the view that at least a component of rFPC activation during bistable perception reflects a response to perceptual transitions, both real and yoked, rather than their cause. This component of activity could reflect the change in sensory experience and task demand that occurs during transitions, which fits well with the known role of these areas in attention and decision making.","Carefully controlling for the character of perceptual transitions has been shown to dramatically reduce the number of brain regions that are viable candidates for determining alternations (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).","['Identifying the neural correlates of bistable perception by recording online activity, however, may confound activity that is causally linked to bistable alternations with activity that is merely correlated with it.', 'The finding that activity in a given brain region (e.g.', 'frontoparietal cortex Kleinschmidt et al., 1998;Lumer and Rees, 1999;Sterzer and Kleinschmidt, 2007;Weilnhammer et al., 2013) correlates with perception does not reveal whether that region drives the alternations, or reflects a consequence of processes occurring elsewhere.', 'Carefully controlling for the character of perceptual transitions has been shown to dramatically reduce the number of brain regions that are viable candidates for determining alternations (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).', 'Consequently, it is still a matter of debate whether different forms of bistable stimuli depend on bottom-up or top down influences, and which specific neural systems support these aspects of conscious experience.', 'The current work capitalizes on the fact that stimulus-independent changes in neural processing occur naturally during wakeful rest.', 'Neuroimaging has revealed that almost all functional networks that support aspects of task related processing have a comparable resting state network (Smith et al., 2009), and the integrity of these networks varies across individuals in a manner that is predictive of complex forms of cognition such as meta cognitive accuracy (Baird et al., 2013), spontaneous thought (Gorgolewski et al., 2014), reading comprehension (Smallwood et al., 2013) and executive control (Reineberg et al., 2015).', 'As the neural activity at rest is uncontaminated by external input, it provides a relatively pure method to explore stimulusindependent neural processes and so a useful tool to understand the functional architecture of bistable perception.']",4,"['Identifying the neural correlates of bistable perception by recording online activity, however, may confound activity that is causally linked to bistable alternations with activity that is merely correlated with it.', 'The finding that activity in a given brain region (e.g.', 'frontoparietal cortex Kleinschmidt et al., 1998;Lumer and Rees, 1999;Sterzer and Kleinschmidt, 2007;Weilnhammer et al., 2013) correlates with perception does not reveal whether that region drives the alternations, or reflects a consequence of processes occurring elsewhere.', 'Carefully controlling for the character of perceptual transitions has been shown to dramatically reduce the number of brain regions that are viable candidates for determining alternations (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).', 'Consequently, it is still a matter of debate whether different forms of bistable stimuli depend on bottom-up or top down influences, and which specific neural systems support these aspects of conscious experience.']"

Despite recent advances in understanding the neural processes underlying such perceptual rivalry, a key question has remained unresolved: Does perceptual rivalry result merely from local bistability of neural activity patterns in sensory stimulus representations, or do higher-order areas play a causal role by shifting inference and, thus, initiating perceptual changes? We used functional MRI to measure brain activity while human observers reported successive spontaneous changes in perceived direction for an ambiguous apparent motion stimulus. In a control condition, the individual sequences of spontaneous perceptual switches during bistability were replayed by using a disambiguated version of the stimulus. Greater activations during spontaneous compared with stimulus-driven switches were observed in inferior frontal cortex bilaterally. Subsequent chronometric analyses of event-related signal time courses showed that, relative to activations in motion-sensitive extrastriate visual cortex, right inferior frontal cortex activation occurred earlier during spontaneous than during stimulus-driven perceptual changes. The temporal precedence of right inferior frontal activations suggests that this region participates in initiating spontaneous switches in perception during constant physical stimulation. Our findings can thus be seen as a signature of when and where the brain ""makes up its mind"" about competing perceptual interpretations of a given sensory input pattern.","At other times we suddenly realize that we having been looking at the world from the wrong perspective: many famous visual illusions depend upon the resolution of uncertain perceptual input (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009).","['A remarkable feature of the human mind is its capacity to process information that is independent of environmental input.', 'We often lose ourselves in our thoughts, decoupling experience from the here and now (Baird et al., 2014).', 'At other times we suddenly realize that we having been looking at the world from the wrong perspective: many famous visual illusions depend upon the resolution of uncertain perceptual input (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009).', 'These examples demonstrate that our conscious experience of our surroundings does not depend solely on the sensory information we receive at any moment in time, an observation that allows insight into the stimulus-independent basis of conscious perception.', 'A popular way to study this dissociation between sensory inputs and conscious experience is to use stimuli that are ambiguous in their interpretation, and for which perception alternates over time.', 'Classic examples include binocular rivalry (Figure 1a), in which incompatible images shown to the two eyes compete for awareness, and the Necker cube (see Figure 1b), in which a wire-frame cube can be perceived from multiple perspectives.', 'Understanding the neural architecture that mediates these alternations is considered a critical step in uncovering neural correlates of consciousness (Crick and Koch, 1998).']",0,"['A remarkable feature of the human mind is its capacity to process information that is independent of environmental input.', 'At other times we suddenly realize that we having been looking at the world from the wrong perspective: many famous visual illusions depend upon the resolution of uncertain perceptual input (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009).']"

Visual phenomena leading to such multistable perception, where constant sensory input evokes different conscious percepts, are particularly useful for investigating the processes underlying perceptual awareness [1]. Understanding the role that high-level brain regions outside early visual cortex play in perceptual alternations could elucidate how top-down processes modulate conscious perception [2]. In two studies [3,4] published recently in Current Biology, different combinations of the present authors used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to disrupt activity in human superior parietal cortex, and reported seemingly contradictory results [5] concerning the effect of disrupting the normal function of this area on bistable perception.

There is a large amount of unexplained variability between individuals in the rate of such spontaneous alternations in perception [2-5]. We hypothesized that variability in perceptual rivalry might be reflected in individual differences in brain structure, because brain structure can exhibit systematic relationships with an individual's cognitive experiences and skills [6-9]. To test this notion, we examined in a large group of individuals how cortical thickness, local gray-matter density, and local white-matter integrity correlate with individuals' alternation rate for a bistable, rotating structure-from-motion stimulus [10]. All of these macroscopic measures of brain structure consistently revealed that the structure of bilateral superior parietal lobes (SPL) could account for interindividual variability in perceptual alternation rate. Furthermore, we examined whether the bilateral SPL regions play a causal role in the rate of perceptual alternations by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and found that transient disruption of these areas indeed decreases the rate of perceptual alternations. These findings demonstrate a direct relationship between structure of SPL and individuals' perceptual switch rate.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

By using functional MRI in humans exposed to bistable viewing conditions, subjective visual perception was related to covariation of activity in multiple extrastriate ventral, parietal, and prefrontal cortical areas. The coordination of activity among these regions was not linked to external sensory or motor events; rather, it reflected internal changes in perception and varied in strength with the frequency of perceptual events, suggesting that functional interactions between visual and prefrontal cortex may contribute to conscious vision.

According to the striatal hypothesis, people decrease response thresholds by increasing activation from cortex to striatum, releasing the brain from inhibition. According to the STN hypothesis, people decrease response thresholds by decreasing activation from cortex to subthalamic nucleus (STN); a decrease in STN activity is likewise thought to release the brain from inhibition and result in responses that are fast but error-prone. To test these hypotheses-both of which may be true-we conducted two experiments on perceptual decision making in which we used cues to vary the demands for speed vs. accuracy. In both experiments, behavioral data and mathematical model analyses confirmed that instruction from the cue selectively affected the setting of response thresholds. In the first experiment we used ultra-high-resolution 7T structural MRI to locate the STN precisely. We then used 3T structural MRI and probabilistic tractography to quantify the connectivity between the relevant brain areas. The results showed that participants who flexibly change response thresholds (as quantified by the mathematical model) have strong structural connections between presupplementary motor area and striatum. This result was confirmed in an independent second experiment. In general, these findings show that individual differences in elementary cognitive tasks are partly driven by structural differences in brain connectivity. Specifically, these findings support a cortico-striatal control account of how the brain implements adaptive switches between cautious and risky behavior.","The striatum is known to be important in relaying prediction error signals to primary regions of cortex (Daw et al., 2011) and might play this role in perceptual decision making (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010; though see also Boekel et al., 2015).","['We regressed mean dominance durations against resting state connectivity from our two seed regions to determine which areas of cortex were involved in determining the dynamics of bistable alternations.', 'We found that the coupling between the aSPL seed and regions of the striatum (green regions in Figure 3a) showed a greater association with faster alternations for the binocular rivalry stimulus (i.e.', 'shorter durations).', 'The striatum is known to be important in relaying prediction error signals to primary regions of cortex (Daw et al., 2011) and might play this role in perceptual decision making (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010; though see also Boekel et al., 2015).']",0,"['The striatum is known to be important in relaying prediction error signals to primary regions of cortex (Daw et al., 2011) and might play this role in perceptual decision making (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010; though see also Boekel et al., 2015).']"

Most studies in humans, however, especially in patients with brain damage, suggest that the human MTL is a unitary memory system supporting all types of declarative memory, our conscious memory for facts and events. To resolve this discrepancy, amnesic patients with either selective hippocampal damage or more extensive MTL damage were tested on variations of an object discrimination task adapted from the nonhuman primate literature. Although both groups were equally impaired on standard recall-based memory tasks, they exhibited different profiles of performance on the object discrimination test, arguing against a unitary view of MTL function. Cases with selective hippocampal damage performed normally, whereas individuals with broader MTL lesions were impaired. Furthermore, deficits in this latter group were related not to the number of discriminations to be learned and remembered, but to the degree of ""feature ambiguity,"" a property of visual discriminations that can emerge when features are part of both rewarded and unrewarded stimuli.

A large-scale brain network, referred to as the default mode network (DMN), has been shown to be involved in both mind-wandering and reading, raising the question as to how the same neural system could be implicated in processes with both costs and benefits to narrative comprehension. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to explore whether the intrinsic functional connectivity of the two key midline hubs of the DMN-the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC)-was predictive of individual differences in reading comprehension and task focus recorded outside of the scanner. Worse comprehension was associated with greater functional connectivity between the PCC and a region of the ventral striatum. Better comprehension was associated with greater functional connectivity with a region of the right insula. By contrast reports of increasing task focus were associated with functional connectivity from the aMPFC to clusters in the PCC, the left parietal and temporal cortex, and the cerebellum. Our results suggest that the DMN has both costs (such as poor comprehension) and benefits to reading (such as an on-task focus) because its midline core can couple its activity with other regions to form distinct functional communities that allow seemingly opposing mental states to occur. This flexible coupling allows the DMN to participate in cognitive states that complement the act of reading as well as others that do not.","Neuroimaging has revealed that almost all functional networks that support aspects of task related processing have a comparable resting state network (Smith et al., 2009), and the integrity of these networks varies across individuals in a manner that is predictive of complex forms of cognition such as meta cognitive accuracy (Baird et al., 2013), spontaneous thought (Gorgolewski et al., 2014), reading comprehension (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013) and executive control (Reineberg et al., 2015).","['Identifying the neural correlates of bistable perception by recording online activity, however, may confound activity that is causally linked to bistable alternations with activity that is merely correlated with it.', 'The finding that activity in a given brain region (e.g.', 'frontoparietal cortex Kleinschmidt et al., 1998;Lumer and Rees, 1999;Sterzer and Kleinschmidt, 2007;Weilnhammer et al., 2013) correlates with perception does not reveal whether that region drives the alternations, or reflects a consequence of processes occurring elsewhere.', 'Carefully controlling for the character of perceptual transitions has been shown to dramatically reduce the number of brain regions that are viable candidates for determining alternations (Knapen et al., 2011).', 'Consequently, it is still a matter of debate whether different forms of bistable stimuli depend on bottom-up or top down influences, and which specific neural systems support these aspects of conscious experience.', 'The current work capitalizes on the fact that stimulus-independent changes in neural processing occur naturally during wakeful rest.', 'Neuroimaging has revealed that almost all functional networks that support aspects of task related processing have a comparable resting state network (Smith et al., 2009), and the integrity of these networks varies across individuals in a manner that is predictive of complex forms of cognition such as meta cognitive accuracy (Baird et al., 2013), spontaneous thought (Gorgolewski et al., 2014), reading comprehension (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013) and executive control (Reineberg et al., 2015).', 'As the neural activity at rest is uncontaminated by external input, it provides a relatively pure method to explore stimulusindependent neural processes and so a useful tool to understand the functional architecture of bistable perception.']",0,"['Neuroimaging has revealed that almost all functional networks that support aspects of task related processing have a comparable resting state network (Smith et al., 2009), and the integrity of these networks varies across individuals in a manner that is predictive of complex forms of cognition such as meta cognitive accuracy (Baird et al., 2013), spontaneous thought (Gorgolewski et al., 2014), reading comprehension (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013) and executive control (Reineberg et al., 2015).']"

Unlike most previous research that focused on the relationship between rs-fcMRI and a single behavioral measure of EF, in the current study we examined the relationship of rs-fcMRI with individual differences in subcomponents of EF. Ninety-one adults completed a resting state fMRI scan and three separate EF tasks outside the magnet: inhibition of prepotent responses, task set shifting, and working memory updating. From these three measures, we derived estimates of common aspects of EF, as well as abilities specific to working memory updating and task shifting. Using Independent Components Analysis (ICA), we identified across the group of participants several networks of regions (Resting State Networks, RSNs) with temporally correlated time courses. We then used dual regression to explore how these RSNs covaried with individual differences in EF. Dual regression revealed that increased higher common EF was associated with connectivity of a) frontal pole with an attentional RSN, and b) Crus I and II of the cerebellum with the right frontoparietal RSN. Moreover, higher shifting-specific abilities were associated with increased connectivity of angular gyrus with a ventral attention RSN. The results of the current study suggest that the organization of the brain at rest may have important implications for individual differences in EF, and that individuals higher in EF may have expanded resting state networks as compared to individuals with lower EF.

Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a number of highly connected and highly central neocortical hub regions, regions that play a key role in global information integration between different parts of the network. The potential functional importance of these Òbrain hubsÓ is underscored by recent studies showing that disturbances of their structural and functional connectivity profile are linked to neuropathology. This study aims to map out both the subcortical and neocortical hubs of the brain and examine their mutual relationship, particularly their structural linkages. Here, we demonstrate that brain hubs form a so-called Òrich club,Ó characterized by a tendency for high-degree nodes to be more densely connected among themselves than nodes of a lower degree, providing important information on the higher-level topology of the brain network. Whole-brain structural networks of 21 subjects were reconstructed using diffusion tensor imaging data. Examining the connectivity profile of these networks revealed a group of 12 strongly interconnected bihemispheric hub regions, comprising the precuneus, superior frontal and superior parietal cortex, as well as the subcortical hippocampus, putamen, and thalamus. Importantly, these hub regions were found to be more densely interconnected than would be expected based solely on their degree, together forming a rich club.

Although effects of reward-or value in general-on perception therefore seem likely, how valuation modulates perception and how such modulation relates to attention is largely unknown. We probed effects of reward on perception by using a binocular-rivalry paradigm. Distinct gratings drifting in opposite directions were presented to each observer's eyes. To objectify their subjective perceptual experience, the optokinetic nystagmus was used as measure of current perceptual dominance. In a first experiment, one of the percepts was either rewarded or attended. We found that reward and attention similarly biased perception. In a second experiment, observers performed an attentionally demanding task either on the rewarded stimulus, the other stimulus, or both. We found that-on top of an attentional effect on perception-at each level of attentional load, reward still modulated perception by increasing the dominance of the rewarded percept. Similarly, penalizing one percept increased dominance of the other at each level of attentional load. In turn, rewarding-and similarly nonpunishing-a percept yielded performance benefits that are typically associated with selective attention. In conclusion, our data show that value modulates perception in a similar way as the volitional deployment of attention, even though the relative effect of value is largely unaffected by an attention task.

These bistable perceptual phenomena provide a unique window into the neural mechanisms that create the contents of conscious perception. Models of bistable perception posit that mutual inhibition between stimulus-selective neural populations in visual cortex plays a key role in these spontaneous perceptual fluctuations. However, a direct link between neural inhibition and bistable perception has not yet been established experimentally. Here, we link perceptual dynamics in three distinct bistable visual illusions (binocular rivalry, motion-induced blindness, and structure from motion) to measurements of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations in human visual cortex (as measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and to pharmacological stimulation of the GABAA receptor by means of lorazepam. As predicted by a model of neural interactions underlying bistability, both higher GABA concentrations in visual cortex and lorazepam administration induced slower perceptual dynamics, as reflected in a reduced number of perceptual switches and a lengthening of percept durations. Thus, we show that GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, shapes the dynamics of bistable perception.

Visser"", ""E. Jefferies"", ""M. A. Lambon Ralph""]","The role of the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) in semantic cognition is not clear from the current literature. Semantic dementia patients show a progressive and a specific semantic impairment, following bilateral atrophy of the ATLs. Neuroimaging studies of healthy participants, however, do not consistently show ATL activation during semantic tasks. Consequently, several influential theories of semantic memory do not ascribe a central role to the ATLs. We conducted a meta-analysis of 164 functional neuroimaging studies of semantic processing to investigate factors that might contribute to the inconsistency in previous results. Four factors influenced the likelihood of finding ATL activation: (1) the use of PET versus fMRI, reflecting the fact that fMRI but not PET is sensitive to distortion artifacts caused by large variations in magnetic susceptibility in the area of the ATL; (2) a field of view (FOV) of more than 15 cm, thereby ensuring whole-brain coverage; (3) the use of a high baseline task to prevent subtraction of otherwise uncontrolled semantic activation; (4) the inclusion of the ATL as an ROI.

Schooler""]","The mind flows in a ""stream of consciousness,"" which often neglects immediate sensory input in favor of focusing on intrinsic, self-generated thoughts or images. Although considerable research has documented the disruptive influences of task-unrelated thought for perceptual processing and task performance, the brain dynamics associated with these phenomena are not well understood. Here we investigate the possibility, suggested by several convergent lines of research, that task-unrelated thought is associated with a reduction in the trial-to-trial phase consistency of the oscillatory neural signal in response to perceptual input. Using an experience sampling paradigm coupled with continuous high-density electroencephalography, we observed that task-unrelated thought was associated with a reduction of the P1 ERP, replicating prior observations that mind-wandering is accompanied by a reduction of the brain-evoked response to sensory input. Time-frequency analysis of the oscillatory neural response revealed a decrease in theta-band cortical phase-locking, which peaked over parietal scalp regions. Furthermore, we observed that task-unrelated thought impacted the oscillatory mode of the brain during the initiation of a task-relevant action, such that more cortical processing was required to meet task demands. Together, these findings document that the attenuation of perceptual processing that occurs during task-unrelated thought is associated with a reduction in the temporal fidelity with which the brain responds to a stimulus and suggest that increased neural processing may be required to recouple attention to a task. More generally, these data provide novel confirmatory evidence for the mechanisms through which attentional states facilitate the neural processing of sensory input.","We often lose ourselves in our thoughts, decoupling experience from the here and now (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014).","['A remarkable feature of the human mind is its capacity to process information that is independent of environmental input.', 'We often lose ourselves in our thoughts, decoupling experience from the here and now (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014).', 'At other times we suddenly realize that we having been looking at the world from the wrong perspective: many famous visual illusions depend upon the resolution of uncertain perceptual input (Sterzer et al., 2009).', 'These examples demonstrate that our conscious experience of our surroundings does not depend solely on the sensory information we receive at any moment in time, an observation that allows insight into the stimulus-independent basis of conscious perception.', 'A popular way to study this dissociation between sensory inputs and conscious experience is to use stimuli that are ambiguous in their interpretation, and for which perception alternates over time.', 'Classic examples include binocular rivalry (Figure 1a), in which incompatible images shown to the two eyes compete for awareness, and the Necker cube (see Figure 1b), in which a wire-frame cube can be perceived from multiple perspectives.', 'Understanding the neural architecture that mediates these alternations is considered a critical step in uncovering neural correlates of consciousness (Crick and Koch, 1998).']",0,"['A remarkable feature of the human mind is its capacity to process information that is independent of environmental input.', 'We often lose ourselves in our thoughts, decoupling experience from the here and now (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014).']"

Margulies"", ""Jonathan Smallwood""]","Although neural activity often reflects the processing of external inputs, intrinsic fluctuations in activity have been observed throughout the brain. These may relate to patterns of self-generated thought that can occur while not performing goal-driven tasks. To understand the relationship between self-generated mental activity and intrinsic neural fluctuations, we developed the New York Cognition Questionnaire (NYC-Q) to assess the content and form of an individual's experiences during the acquisition of resting-state fMRI data. The data were collected as a part of the Nathan Kline Rockland Enhanced sample. We decomposed NYC-Q scores using exploratory factor analysis and found that self-reported thoughts clustered into distinct dimensions of content (future related, past related, positive, negative, and social) and form (words, images, and specificity). We used these components to perform an individual difference analysis exploring how differences in the types of self-generated thoughts relate to whole brain measures of intrinsic brain activity (fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and degree centrality). We found patterns of self-generated thoughts related to changes that were distributed across a wide range of cortical areas. For example, individuals who reported greater imagery exhibited greater low frequency fluctuations in a region of perigenual cingulate cortex, a region that is known to participate in the so-called default-mode network. We also found certain forms of thought were associated with other areas, such as primary visual cortex, the insula, and the cerebellum. For example, individuals who reported greater future thought exhibited less homogeneous neural fluctuations in a region of lateral occipital cortex, a result that is consistent with the claim that particular types of self-generated thought depend on processes that are decoupled from sensory processes. These data provide evidence that self-generated thought is a heterogeneous category of experience and that studying its content can be helpful in understanding brain dynamics.","Neuroimaging has revealed that almost all functional networks that support aspects of task related processing have a comparable resting state network (Smith et al., 2009), and the integrity of these networks varies across individuals in a manner that is predictive of complex forms of cognition such as meta cognitive accuracy (Baird et al., 2013), spontaneous thought (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014), reading comprehension (Smallwood et al., 2013) and executive control (Reineberg et al., 2015).","['Identifying the neural correlates of bistable perception by recording online activity, however, may confound activity that is causally linked to bistable alternations with activity that is merely correlated with it.', 'The finding that activity in a given brain region (e.g.', 'frontoparietal cortex Kleinschmidt et al., 1998;Lumer and Rees, 1999;Sterzer and Kleinschmidt, 2007;Weilnhammer et al., 2013) correlates with perception does not reveal whether that region drives the alternations, or reflects a consequence of processes occurring elsewhere.', 'Carefully controlling for the character of perceptual transitions has been shown to dramatically reduce the number of brain regions that are viable candidates for determining alternations (Knapen et al., 2011).', 'Consequently, it is still a matter of debate whether different forms of bistable stimuli depend on bottom-up or top down influences, and which specific neural systems support these aspects of conscious experience.', 'The current work capitalizes on the fact that stimulus-independent changes in neural processing occur naturally during wakeful rest.', 'Neuroimaging has revealed that almost all functional networks that support aspects of task related processing have a comparable resting state network (Smith et al., 2009), and the integrity of these networks varies across individuals in a manner that is predictive of complex forms of cognition such as meta cognitive accuracy (Baird et al., 2013), spontaneous thought (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014), reading comprehension (Smallwood et al., 2013) and executive control (Reineberg et al., 2015).', 'As the neural activity at rest is uncontaminated by external input, it provides a relatively pure method to explore stimulusindependent neural processes and so a useful tool to understand the functional architecture of bistable perception.']",0,"['Neuroimaging has revealed that almost all functional networks that support aspects of task related processing have a comparable resting state network (Smith et al., 2009), and the integrity of these networks varies across individuals in a manner that is predictive of complex forms of cognition such as meta cognitive accuracy (Baird et al., 2013), spontaneous thought (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014), reading comprehension (Smallwood et al., 2013) and executive control (Reineberg et al., 2015).']"

Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum.

Much current interest is focused on the controversy over the neural site of binocular rivalry, a variety of perceptual rivalry for which a number of different cortical regions have been implicated. Debate continues over the relative role of higher levels of processing compared with primary visual cortex and the suggestion that different forms of rivalry involve different cortical areas. Here we show that the temporal pattern of disappearance and reappearance in motion-induced blindness (MIB) (Bonneh et al, 2001 Nature 411 798-801) is highly correlated with the pattern of oscillation reported during binocular rivalry in the same individual. This correlation holds over a wide range of inter-individual variation. Temporal similarity in the two phenomena was strikingly confirmed by the effects of the hallucinogen LSD, which produced the same, extraordinary, pattern of increased rhythmicity in both kinds of perceptual oscillation. Furthermore. MIB demonstrates the two properties previously considered characteristic of binocular rivalry. Namely the distribution of dominance periods can be approximated by a gamma distribution and, in line with Levelt's second proposition of binocular rivalry, predominance of one perceptual phase can be increased through a reduction in the predominance time of the opposing phase. We conclude that (i) MIB is a form of perceptual rivalry, and (ii) there may be a common oscillator responsible for timing aspects of all forms of perceptual rivalry.","There was a clear correlation (r=0.46, p<0.05) between the geometric mean dominance durations for the two tasks, consistent with previous work (#AUTHOR_TAG and Pettigrew, 2003) (though see also Gallagher and Arnold, 2014), as shown in Figure 1d.","['To understand the function these networks play in bistable perception, we analyzed resting state scans from a further 26 individuals who also took part in an experiment outside of the scanner to measure their dominance durations for two bistable stimuli (Figure 1a,b).', 'We verified that the same networks were produced from our two parietal seed regions for this independent group of participants (see Supplementary Figure S2).', 'Dominance durations for both rivalry and the Necker cube conformed to the gamma distribution typically observed with bistable stimuli (Figure 1c).', 'There was a clear correlation (r=0.46,', 'There was a clear correlation (r=0.46, p<0.05) between the geometric mean dominance durations for the two tasks, consistent with previous work (#AUTHOR_TAG and Pettigrew, 2003) (though see also Gallagher and Arnold, 2014), as shown in Figure 1d.']",1,"['There was a clear correlation (r=0.46, p<0.05) between the geometric mean dominance durations for the two tasks, consistent with previous work (#AUTHOR_TAG and Pettigrew, 2003) (though see also Gallagher and Arnold, 2014), as shown in Figure 1d.']"
CCT146,30272741,Brain networks underlying bistable perception,Daniel Baker,Right parietal TMS shortens dominance durations in binocular rivalry,"[""David Carmel"", ""Vincent Walsh"", ""Nilli Lavie"", ""Geraint Rees""]","Binocular rivalry occurs when dissimilar images are presented to each eye. Rather than a combined picture being perceived, each monocular image competes for perceptual dominance, becoming visible for a few seconds while the other is suppressed. Stable visual input thus leads to alternations in conscious perception, dissociating stimulation from awareness. This makes rivalry particularly useful for elucidating the neural processes underlying consciousness [1]. Retinotopic visual cortex [2] and lateral geniculate nucleus [3] activity are modulated by such alternating perception, implying an early locus for rivaling neural representations. However, higher cortical regions, including right superior parietal cortex, exhibit activity that is time-locked to perceptual transitions [4]. Though this implies the involvement of top-down processes in rivalry, the correlational nature of neuroimaging precludes the attribution of a causal role to such activity, which may instead simply reflect orientating attention to the transition. Here we distinguish these two hypotheses by showing that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over right superior parietal cortex shortened binocular rivalry dominance durations. This suggests that right parietal cortex maintains the current perceptual state during rivalry.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Statistics, data mining, and artificial intelligence are disciplines focused on extracting knowledge from data. They provide tools for testing hypotheses, predicting new observations, quantifying population effects, and efficiently summarizing data. In these fields, quantitative and qualitative data is used to derive knowledge. The concept of Information Quality (InfoQ) is defined by Kenett and Shmueli as the potential of a dataset to achieve a specific (scientific or practical) goal using a given data analysis method. Eight dimensions help assess the level of InfoQ of a study. These are: Data Resolution, Data Structure, Data Integration, Temporal Relevance, Generalizability, Chronology of Data and Goal, Operationalization, and Communication. This paper shows with examples, how combining graphical analysis with Bayesian analysis in the form of Bayesian networks generates high InfoQ. Specifically, we refer to examples from customer surveys of high tech companies, risk management of telecom systems, monitoring of bioreactors and managing healthcare of diabetic patients. These examples support the more general claim made here that Bayesian networks generate high information quality (InfoQ).","For general applications of Bayesian networks see #AUTHOR_TAG. 12 owever the main classes of BNs are discrete, normal or discrete-normal, where discrete BNs are limited to small-sized datasets, and normal BNs are limited by the joint normality assumption.","['NPBNs originate from probabilistic graphical models, which represent multivariate densities via a combination of a qualitative graph structure that encodes independencies and local quantitative parameters.', 'Bayesian networks (BNs) are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) whose nodes represent variables and the edges represent causal relationships between the variables.', 'These variables are associated to conditional probability functions that, together with the DAG, are able to provide a compact representation of high-dimensional distributions.', 'For an introduction and for more details about the definitions and main results see, for example, Cowell, 19 Jensen 20,21 or Pearl 22 ; for the use of BNs for problem solving and model building see Fenton and Neil. 23', 'hese models have been applied in official statistics data analysis by Penny and Reale 10 who used graphical models to identify relevant components in a saturated structural VAR model of the quarterly gross domestic product that aggregates a large number of economic time series.', 'More recently, Vicard and Scanu 4 also applied Bayesian networks to official statistics, showing that the use of post-stratification allows integration and missing data imputation.', 'For general applications of Bayesian networks see Kenett. 12', 'For general applications of Bayesian networks see #AUTHOR_TAG. 12 owever the main classes of BNs are discrete, normal or discrete-normal, where discrete BNs are limited to small-sized datasets, and normal BNs are limited by the joint normality assumption.', 'For this reason, researchers proposed alternative methodologies.', 'Elidan 24 points out the need for a synergy between the copula framework and the field of machine learning.', 'Kurowica and Cooke 25 and Hanea et al. 26 introduced continuous NPBNs, using copulas to realize rank correlations in directed acyclic graphs.', 'Their approach is based on nonparametric statistical inference and elicited expert knowledge to understand the dependencies among the variables, and uses conditionalization for diagnosis and prediction.']",2,"['For general applications of Bayesian networks see #AUTHOR_TAG. 12 owever the main classes of BNs are discrete, normal or discrete-normal, where discrete BNs are limited to small-sized datasets, and normal BNs are limited by the joint normality assumption.']"

Commercial tools with an advanced graphical user interface that support BBNs construction and inference are available. Thus, building and working with BBNs is very efficient as long as one is not forced to quantify complex BBNs. A high assessment burden of discrete BBNs is often caused by the discretization of continuous variables. Until recently, continuous BBNs were restricted to the joint normal distribution. We present the ÔcopulaÐvineÕ approach to continuous BBNs. This approach is quite general and allows traceable and defendable quantification methods, but it comes at a price: these BBNs must be evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation. Updating such a BBN requires re-sampling the whole structure. The advantages of fast updating algorithms for discrete BBNs are decisive. A hybrid method advanced here samples the continuous BBN once, and then discretizes this so as to enable fast updating. This combines the reduced assessment burden and modelling flexibility of the continuous BBNs with the fast updating algorithms of discrete BBNs. Sampling large complex structures only once can still involve time consuming numerical calculations. Therefore a new sampling protocol based on normal vines is developed. Normal vines are used to realize the dependence structure specified via (conditional) rank correlations on the continuous BBN. We will emphasize the advantages of this method by means of examples.

Under the 2PI CTP scheme with this initial configuration, three different approximations are considered: a) the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation, b) the next-to-leading order 1/_ expansion of the 2PI effective action up to second order in the interaction strength and c) a second order perturbative expansion in the interaction strength. We present detailed comparisons between these approximations and determine their range of validity by contrasting them with the exact many body solution for a moderate number of atoms and wells. As a general feature we observe that because the second order 2PI approximations include multi-particle scattering in a systematic way, they are able to capture damping effects exhibited in the exact solution that a mean field collisionless approach fails to produce. While the second order approximations show a clear improvement over the HFB approximation our numerical result shows that they do not work so well at late times, when interaction effects are significant.","Several authors have used these approaches to study the BHM both from the weakly interacting limit (large / ) #AUTHOR_TAG[163][164][165][166] and the strongly interacting limit (small / ) [112,120,167,168].","['Several authors have used these approaches to study the BHM both from the weakly interacting limit (large / ) #AUTHOR_TAG[163][164][165][166] and the strongly interacting limit (small / ) [112,120,167,168].', 'The Schwinger-Keldysh approach has also been used to study out-of-equilibrium dynamics for the BHM with periodic driving [20], including allowing for the possibility of ohmic dissipation [20,169].', 'I first discuss the two-particle irreducible formalism which has a weak interaction starting point and then discuss the strongly interacting approach.']",4,"['Several authors have used these approaches to study the BHM both from the weakly interacting limit (large / ) #AUTHOR_TAG[163][164][165][166] and the strongly interacting limit (small / ) [112,120,167,168].']"

Weichman"", ""G. Grinstein"", ""Daniel S. Fisher""]","The phase diagrams and phase transitions of bosons with short-ranged repulsive interactions moving in periodic and/or random external potentials at zero temperature are investigated with emphasis on the superfluid-insulator transition induced by varying a parameter such as the density. Bosons in periodic potentials (e.g., on a lattice) at T=0 exhibit two types of phases: a superfluid phase and Mott insulating phases characterized by integer (or commensurate) boson densities, by the existence of a gap for particle-hole excitations, and by zero compressibility. Generically, the superfluid onset transition in d dimensions from a Mott insulator to superfluidity is ''ideal,'' or mean field in character, but at special multicritical points with particle-hole symmetry it is in the universality class of the (d+1)-dimensional XY model. In the presence of disorder, a third, ''Bose glass'' phase exists. This phase is insulating because of the localization effects of the randomness and analogous to the Fermi glass phase of interacting fermions in a strongly disordered potential. The Bose glass phase is characterized by a finite compressibility, no gap, but an infinite superfluid susceptibility. In the presence of disorder the transition to superfluidity is argued to occur only from the Bose glass phase, and never directly from the Mott insulator. This zero-temperature superfluid-insulator transition is studied via generalizations of the Josephson scaling relation for the superfluid density at the ordinary l transition, highlighting the crucial role of quantum fluctuations. The transition is found to have a dynamic critical exponent z exactly equal to d and correlation length and order-parameter correlation exponents n and e which satisfy the bounds n>=2/d and e<=2-d, respectively. It is argued that the superfluid-insulator transition in the presence of disorder may have an upper critical dimension dc which is infinite, but a perturbative renormalization-group calculation wherein the critical exponents have mean-field values for weak disorder above d=4 is also discussed. Many of these conclusions are verified by explicit calculations on a model of one-dimensional bosons in the presence of both random and periodic potentials. The general results are applied to experiments on 4He absorbed in porous media such as Vycor. Some measurable properties of the superfluid onset are predicted exactly [e.g., the exponent x relating the l transition temperature to the zero-temperature superfluid density is found to be d/2(d-1)], while stringent bounds are placed on others.

Several classes of transitions will be briefly reviewed, pointing out, e.g., conceptual differences between ordering transitions in metallic and insulating systems. An interesting separate class of transitions are boundary phase transitions where only degrees of freedom of a subsystem become critical; this will be illustrated in a few examples.

Nevertheless, the matter wave field has a quantized structure owing to the granularity of the discrete underlying atoms. Although such a field is usually assumed to be intrinsically stable (apart from incoherent loss processes), this is no longer true when the condensate is in a coherent superposition of different atom number states. For example, in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined by a three-dimensional optical lattice, each potential well can be prepared in a coherent superposition of different atom number states, with constant relative phases between neighbouring lattice sites. It is then natural to ask how the individual matter wave fields and their relative phases evolve. Here we use such a set-up to investigate these questions experimentally, observing that the matter wave field of the Bose-Einstein condensate undergoes a periodic series of collapses and revivals; this behaviour is directly demonstrated in the dynamical evolution of the multiple matter wave interference pattern.

Here we report fluorescence imaging of strongly interacting bosonic Mott insulators in an optical lattice with single-atom and single-site resolution. From our images, we fully reconstruct the atom distribution on the lattice and identify individual excitations with high fidelity. A comparison of the radial density and variance distributions with theory provides a precise in situ temperature and entropy measurement from single images. We observe Mott-insulating plateaus with near-zero entropy and clearly resolve the high-entropy rings separating them, even though their width is of the order of just a single lattice site. Furthermore, we show how a Mott insulator melts with increasing temperature, owing to a proliferation of local defects.

By applying the Mutual Climatic Range method on the amphibian and reptile assemblages, we propose here new quantitative data on the terrestrial climatic conditions throughout the latest Pleistocene sequence of GorhamÕs Cave. In comparison with current climatic data, all mean annual temperatures were about 1.6-1.8 degrees C lower in this region. Winters were colder and summers were similar to today. Mean annual precipitation was slightly lower, but according to the Aridity Index of Gaussen there were only four dry months during the latest Pleistocene as opposed to five dry months today during the summer. The climate was Mediterranean and semi-arid (according to the Aridity Index of Dantin-Revenga) or semi-humid (according to the Aridity Index of Martonne). The atmospheric temperature range was higher during the latest Pleistocene, mainly due to lower winter temperatures. Such data support recent bioclimatic models, which indicate that high rainfall levels may have been a significant factor in the late survival of Neanderthal populations in southern Iberia.

The mean square displacement (MSD) of the 1D Brownian walker within subdiffusing boundaries is calculated exactly and generalizes well known results when the boundaries are immobile. Furthermore, under certain conditions, if the boundary dynamics are strongly subdiffusive, we show the appearance of an interesting non-monotonicity in the time dependence of the MSD, giving rise to transient negative diffusion.Comment: 13 pages, 4 figure",Issues of identity are similarly negotiated in relation to fluvial regimes (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1968;Smith 1990;Strang 1997;Lee and Daly 1999).,"['Periodic shifts in flow qualities and thawing are a good example in this respect.', 'These microscale river transformations are ethnographically, in many cases, associated with huge feasting activities and Brites of passage^: the Native Americans of the Northwest Coast, for example, coordinate gift-giving ceremonies with riverine fluctuations (e.g., Pritzker 1998;Waldman 2006;Johansen andPritzker 2008, 1048ff.; see also Strang 2004Strang , 2008.', 'Issues of identity are similarly negotiated in relation to fluvial regimes (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1968;Smith 1990;Strang 1997;Lee and Daly 1999).', 'The Akulmiut of western Alaska, for example, consider themselves as Bpeople between Yukon and Kuskokwim^ (Andrews 1994), while the Khwe of southern Africa determine their location by referring to Bthis^or Bthe other side^of the Kavango River (Brenzinger 2008).', 'In the case of the Cholanaickan of southern India, rivers even serve as boundaries that separate different regional groups and thus spatially construct and enforce social identities (Bhanu 1992).']",0,['Issues of identity are similarly negotiated in relation to fluvial regimes (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1968;Smith 1990;Strang 1997;Lee and Daly 1999).']

Conard""]","The German site of Geissenklosterle is crucial to debates concerning the European Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition and the origins of the Aurignacian in Europe. Previous dates from the site are central to an important hypothesis, the Kulturpumpe model, which posits that the Swabian Jura was an area where crucial behavioural developments took place and then spread to other parts of Europe. The previous chronology (critical to the model), is based mainly on radiocarbon dating, but remains poorly constrained due to the dating resolution and the variability of dates. The cause of these problems is disputed, but two principal explanations have been proposed: a) larger than expected variations in the production of atmospheric radiocarbon, and b) taphonomic influences in the site mixing the bones that were dated into different parts of the site. We reinvestigate the chronology using a new series of radiocarbon determinations obtained from the Mousterian, Aurignacian and Gravettian levels. The results strongly imply that the previous dates were affected by insufficient decontamination of the bone collagen prior to dating. Using an ultrafiltration protocol the chronometric picture becomes much clearer. Comparison of the results against other recently dated sites in other parts of Europe suggests the Early Aurignacian levels are earlier than other sites in the south of France and Italy, but not as early as recently dated sites which suggest a pre-Aurignacian dispersal of modern humans to Italy by ~45000 cal BP. They are consistent with the importance of the Danube Corridor as a key route for the movement of people and ideas. The new dates fail to refute the Kulturpumpe model and suggest that Swabian Jura is a region that contributed significantly to the evolution of symbolic behaviour as indicated by early evidence for figurative art, music and mythical imagery.","Recent radiocarbon dates from the key Swabian Jura sites of Hohle Fels and Geißenklösterle in the Ach valley, a small tributary of the Upper Danube, support this view and place the earliest occupation in the region even before Heinrich event IV (Conard 2009a;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2012Higham et al. , 2014.","['The Danube River in particular holds a key position in structuring population movement and sociocultural exchange in an east-west direction (Conard 2000, p. 351;Bolus 2003, 2008;Floss 2003aFloss , 2009aBolus 2009).', 'Recent radiocarbon dates from the key Swabian Jura sites of Hohle Fels and Geißenklösterle in the Ach valley, a small tributary of the Upper Danube, support this view and place the earliest occupation in the region even before Heinrich event IV (Conard 2009a;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2012Higham et al. , 2014.', 'Dates between 40 and 42 ka cal.', 'BP for a wellestablished Early Aurignacian presence in the Upper Danube suggest that AMH groups very rapidly entered the gates of Europe via this large river valley (Conard and Bolus 2003;Bolus 2009).', 'The age determinations are supported by several other Early Aurignacian sites from the region that yielded calibrated 14 C dates between 38 and 40 ka BP (Conard 2003(Conard , 2006Nigst 2006;Jöris et al. 2010;Kind et al. 2015).', ""Moreover, these sites share a regionally distinct Bcultural heritage^represented by a unique tradition of both ivory figurines and personal ornaments (Hahn 1993;Floss 2000, 2010;Vanhaeren and d'Errico 2006;Floss 2007Floss , 2009bConard 2007Conard , 2009aPorr 2010;Wolf 2015;Conard et al. 2015)."", 'We would argue that the emergence of a regionally distinct tradition of figurine and ornament making already signals the end of a true Bpioneer phaseî n the initial incursion into the European mainland.', 'From this perspective, the very early and therefore pioneer Aurignacian assemblages reflecting an initial advance into largely unknown landscapes are expected to be even more rudimentary and ephemeral in this respect (cf.', 'Davies 2001Davies , 2007.', 'Recent evidence from Willendorf II in Lower Austria is in strong agreement with this model and demonstrates the presence of Aurignacian technologies without personal ornaments and figurines along the Danube already before ka cal.', 'BP (Nigst et al. 2014).']",0,"['Recent radiocarbon dates from the key Swabian Jura sites of Hohle Fels and Geißenklösterle in the Ach valley, a small tributary of the Upper Danube, support this view and place the earliest occupation in the region even before Heinrich event IV (Conard 2009a;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2012Higham et al. , 2014.', 'Dates between 40 and 42 ka cal.', 'BP for a wellestablished Early Aurignacian presence in the Upper Danube suggest that AMH groups very rapidly entered the gates of Europe via this large river valley (Conard and Bolus 2003;Bolus 2009).', 'The age determinations are supported by several other Early Aurignacian sites from the region that yielded calibrated 14 C dates between 38 and 40 ka BP (Conard 2003(Conard , 2006Nigst 2006;Joris et al. 2010;Kind et al. 2015).', ""Moreover, these sites share a regionally distinct Bcultural heritage^represented by a unique tradition of both ivory figurines and personal ornaments (Hahn 1993;Floss 2000, 2010;Vanhaeren and d'Errico 2006;Floss 2007Floss , 2009bConard 2007Conard , 2009aPorr 2010;Wolf 2015;Conard et al. 2015)."", 'We would argue that the emergence of a regionally distinct tradition of figurine and ornament making already signals the end of a true Bpioneer phasei n the initial incursion into the European mainland.', 'From this perspective, the very early and therefore pioneer Aurignacian assemblages reflecting an initial advance into largely unknown landscapes are expected to be even more rudimentary and ephemeral in this respect (cf.']"

A detailed geological reconstruction of The Netherlands' south-west offshore area provides a stratigraphical context for archaeological and palaeontological finds. Progressive environmental developments have left a strong imprint on the area's Palaeolithic record. We highlight aspects of landscape evolution and related taphonomical changes, visualized in maps for critical periods of the Pleistocene in the wider southern North Sea region. The Middle Pleistocene record is divided into two palaeogeographical stages: the pre-Anglian/Elsterian stage, during which a wide land bridge existed between England and Belgium even during marine highstands; and the Anglian/Elsterian to Saalian interglacial, with a narrower land bridge, lowered by proglacial erosion but not yet fully eroded. The Late Pleistocene landscape was very different, with the land bridge fully dissected by an axial Rhine-Thames valley, eroded deep enough to fully connect the English Channel and the North Sea during periods of highstand. This tripartite staging implies great differences in (i) possible migration routes of herds of herbivores as well as hominins preying upon them, (ii) the erosion base of axial and tributary rivers causing an increase in the availability of flint raw materials and (iii) conditions for loess accumulation in northern France and Belgium and the resulting preservation of Middle Palaeolithic sites.

Golledge""]","The volume of research dedicated to uncovering cognitive information about urban environments is rapidly growing, although this Work is still in its infancy. A number of critical problems remain to be solved and their solutions widely accepted before the results of these investigations can be incorporated into existing theory or can be converted to practical use. The purpose of this paper is to discuss methods of representing cognitive information in such a way that it can be objectively verified, to suggest analytical procedures for interpreting the representations so obtained, and to suggest a range of activities which may profit from the use of cognitive representations. Throughout the course of the discussion, reference will be made to a recent project in the city of Columbus, Ohio. REPRESENTING COGNIZED ENVIRONMENTS While it is a matter of definition that cognitive information is peculiar to each individual, abundant evidence indicates that most people share recognition of many external cues. Although external reality is filtered thrbugh the senses by a person's unique cognitive transformation processes, communication about what is being processed is necessarily tied into language, verbal or otherwise. This information is transmitted on an interpersonal basis by referring the cognitively processed bits of information to acceptable conceptual schemas and communicable descriptive terms. Awareness of phenomenon external to mind can be generated by any of our senses, and differences of opinion as to what is sending messages or what may be said to actually occur in an environment may arise when different senses are used in the information-extraction process, when physiological qualities of the senses differ among the observers, when different transactional modes are used to elicit information, where the observer's locations vary, or where values, ethics, and mores of individual observers differ. Consequently, before one can make statements about representing cognitive information about an external environment, it is critical to become aware of what environment is being sensed and what skills or senses the receptor individual is using to filter the mass of ""to-whom-it-may-concern"" messages that emanate from phenomenon outside of mind.

These fast and frugal algorithms violate fundamental tenets of classical rationality: They neither look up nor integrate all information. By computer simulation, the authors held a competition between the satisfying ""Take The Best"" algorithm and various ""rational"" inference procedures (e.g., multiple regression). The Take The Best algorithm matched or outperformed all competitors in inferential speed and accuracy. This result in an existence proof that cognitive mechanisms capable of successful performance in the real world do not need to satisfy the classical norms of rational inference.","In this way, rivers constitute an important cornerstone of a Bbounded^or Becological^perspective on decision-making and judgment in space (Simon 1989;#AUTHOR_TAG and Goldstein 1996;Gigerenzer and Selten 2002;Kahneman 2003;Grüne-Yanoff 2007;Todd et al. 2012).","['In this way, rivers constitute an important cornerstone of a Bbounded^or Becological^perspective on decision-making and judgment in space (Simon 1989;#AUTHOR_TAG and Goldstein 1996;Gigerenzer and Selten 2002;Kahneman 2003;Grüne-Yanoff 2007;Todd et al. 2012).', 'Viewed in this light, heuristics can even be seen as integral components of the human Badaptive toolbox^ (Gigerenzer et al. 1999;Boudry et al. 2015;Polonioli 2015).', 'They provide behavioral guidelines by their own virtue, which is by no means Bmystical,^but grounded in the specific nature of each riverenvironment relationship.']",4,"['In this way, rivers constitute an important cornerstone of a Bbounded^or Becological^perspective on decision-making and judgment in space (Simon 1989;#AUTHOR_TAG and Goldstein 1996;Gigerenzer and Selten 2002;Kahneman 2003;Grüne-Yanoff 2007;Todd et al. 2012).', 'Viewed in this light, heuristics can even be seen as integral components of the human Badaptive toolbox^ (Gigerenzer et al. 1999;Boudry et al. 2015;Polonioli 2015).']"

Traditional models of unbounded rationality and optimization in cognitive science, economics, and animal behavior have tended to view decision-makers as possessing supernatural powers of reason, limitless knowledge, and endless time. But understanding decisions in the real world requires a more psychologically plausible notion of bounded rationality. In Simple heuristics that make us smart (Gigerenzer et al. 1999), we explore fast and frugal heuristics--simple rules in the mind's adaptive toolbox for making decisions with realistic mental resources. These heuristics can enable both living organisms and artificial systems to make smart choices quickly and with a minimum of information by exploiting the way that information is structured in particular environments. In this precis, we show how simple building blocks that control information search, stop search, and make decisions can be put together to form classes of heuristics, including: ignorance-based and one-reason decision making for choice, elimination models for categorization, and satisficing heuristics for sequential search. These simple heuristics perform comparably to more complex algorithms, particularly when generalizing to new data--that is, simplicity leads to robustness. We present evidence regarding when people use simple heuristics and describe the challenges to be addressed by this research program.","Viewed in this light, heuristics can even be seen as integral components of the human Badaptive toolbox^ (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1999;Boudry et al. 2015;Polonioli 2015).","['In this way, rivers constitute an important cornerstone of a Bbounded^or Becological^perspective on decision-making and judgment in space (Simon 1989;Gigerenzer and Goldstein 1996;Gigerenzer and Selten 2002;Kahneman 2003;Grüne-Yanoff 2007;Todd et al. 2012).', 'Viewed in this light, heuristics can even be seen as integral components of the human Badaptive toolbox^ (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1999;Boudry et al. 2015;Polonioli 2015).', 'They provide behavioral guidelines by their own virtue, which is by no means Bmystical,^but grounded in the specific nature of each riverenvironment relationship.']",4,"['Viewed in this light, heuristics can even be seen as integral components of the human Badaptive toolbox^ (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1999;Boudry et al. 2015;Polonioli 2015).']"

Accounts of people surviving and even thriving in peripheral areas are often instrumental to construct and maintain the dichotomy between 'the desert and the sown.' It is sometimes stated that mobile peoples obtain their material culture from neighboring settled populations, rather than produce their own, and that they do not leave recognizable archaeological traces apart from 'ephemeral campsites.' From the 24 chapters in this volume, however, it is clear that there is indeed an 'archaeology of mobility.'By applying specific and well-defined methods, it is eminently possible to come to a better understanding of mobile people in archaeological contexts. Such an archaeology of mobility encompasses much more than tracing ephemeral campsites. Much like any other group, mobile people produce, appear to use and discard a distinct material culture which includes functional objects, art and architecture. There have been edited books on the archaeology of nomadism in various regions, and there have been individual archaeological and anthropological monographs, but nothing with the kind of coverage provided in this volume.

Initially we discuss the nature of cognitive maps and the process of cognitive mapping as mechanisms for developing person to object (egocentric) and object to object (allocentric) internal representations. Imperfections in encoding either relations can introduce imperfections in representations of environments in memory. This, together with individual differences in human spatial abilities, can result in data manipulations that produce error. When information stored in long term memory is brought into working memory for purposes of decision making and choice behavior (as in route selection), the result may be the selection of an inefficient or incorrect path. We explore the connection between environmental learning and cognitive maps in the context of learning a route in two different cultural environments-Belfast (Northern Ireland) and Santa Barbara (California). Blind, vision impaired, and sighted volunteers traveled and learned routes of approximately the same length (1.2miles) in their respective urban environments. An initial trial was experimenter guided; three following trials were regarded as ""test"" trials where the participants learned the route and performed route fixing tasks including pointing between designated places, verbally describing the route after each completion, and building a model of the route using metallic strips on a magnetic board. Results indicated that by the end of the third test trial, and using the reinforcing strategies, the results of the blind or vision impaired participants could not be statistically differentiated from those of the sighted participants.

Such patterns necessarily comprise many interacting locales, and it is at the landscape scale that we should attempt to understand the relationship between ethnographic and archeological data. This paper derives, quantifies and tests a series of basic predictions about the effects of group size, occupation duration and habitat quality on mobility strategies using a substantial ethnographic dataset. The results demonstrate that habitat quality is the best determinant of move distances among hunter-gatherers, but that occupation duration also has an effect among those foragers who rely principally on hunting. It is suggested that three roughly concentric zones, the limit of scatter, the foraging radius, and the logistic radius, are predicted by group size and occupation duration, habitat quality, and proportions of hunting and logistical mobility, respectively. The relevance of these conclusions to more generic ecological theory is discussed in the context of evolutionary forces acting on hunter-gatherer mobility in prehistory.","Archaeologists, consequently, have ever since attempted to tackle the Bspatiality^of past human social units from a whole range of different angles (e.g., Shott 1986;Kelly 1992;Close 2000;Brantingham 2006;Bernard and Wendrich 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG 2009Grove , 2010Turq et al. 2013;Cameron 2013;Van Dommelen 2014).","['Humans are spatial beings and the nature of our spatial presence is in many ways crucial for what we are.', 'How we define our relationship to the world and how we understand and access what surrounds us is an important cornerstone of our different lifestyles.', 'Space utilization (Raumnutzung), therefore, is a central research area for all the human sciences (e.g., Dünne and Günzel 2006;Warf and Arias 2009;Bachman-Medick 2010).', 'Archaeologists, consequently, have ever since attempted to tackle the Bspatiality^of past human social units from a whole range of different angles (e.g., Shott 1986;Kelly 1992;Close 2000;Brantingham 2006;Bernard and Wendrich 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG 2009Grove , 2010Turq et al. 2013;Cameron 2013;Van Dommelen 2014).', 'Yet, how anchoring key notions such as Bspace^need to be approached is highly disputed and remains a very sensitive matter.']",0,"['Archaeologists, consequently, have ever since attempted to tackle the Bspatiality^of past human social units from a whole range of different angles (e.g., Shott 1986;Kelly 1992;Close 2000;Brantingham 2006;Bernard and Wendrich 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG 2009Grove , 2010Turq et al. 2013;Cameron 2013;Van Dommelen 2014).']"

Studies 1 (N = 240) and 2 (N = 143) presented gender-based inequality as stable, changing, or changed. In both studies, sexism was positively associated with essentialism only among men and only when inequality was presented as changing. Study 3 (N = 552) explored the possible consequences of expressing essentialist theories for social change. Exposure to essentialist theories increased both men's and women's acceptance of inequality. Exposure further increased men's support for discriminatory practices and boosted their self-esteem. These patterns demonstrate that although essentialism is linked to prejudice, this link is itself not essential. Rather, essentialism may be invoked strategically to protect higher status when this is threatened by change and may be successful in so doing.","Although belief in the biological determination of sexual orientation is correlated with tolerance towards lesbians and gay men, beliefs in biological determination are also correlated with prejudice and stereotyping of other minority groups (c.f., Bastian & Haslam, 2006;Keller, 2005;Martin & Parker, 1995;#AUTHOR_TAG, Postmes, Haslam, & Hornsey, 2009;Prentice & Miller, 2007;Williams & Eberhardt, 2008;Yzerbyt, Rocher, & Schadron, 1997).","['Although belief in the biological determination of sexual orientation is correlated with tolerance towards lesbians and gay men, beliefs in biological determination are also correlated with prejudice and stereotyping of other minority groups (c.f., Bastian & Haslam, 2006;Keller, 2005;Martin & Parker, 1995;#AUTHOR_TAG, Postmes, Haslam, & Hornsey, 2009;Prentice & Miller, 2007;Williams & Eberhardt, 2008;Yzerbyt, Rocher, & Schadron, 1997).', ""This pattern of results has led researchers to wonder if sexual prejudice is a 'special case' in this literature (e.g., D.J.

Contrary to previous research, three dimensions were obtained: the belief that homosexuality is biologically based, immutable, and fixed early in life; the belief that it is cross-culturally and historically universal; and the belief that it constitutes a discrete, entitative type with defining features. Study 1 supported a three-factor structure for essentialist beliefs about male homosexuality. Study 2 replicated this structure with confirmatory factor analysis, extended it to beliefs about lesbianism, showed that all three dimensions predicted antigay attitudes, and demonstrated that essentialist beliefs mediate associations between prejudice and gender, ethnicity, and religiosity.

Attribution theorists argue that this is because immutability beliefs reduce stigmatization. In two studies, 97 American and 72 British heterosexual-identified students reported their beliefs about the immutability and fundamentality of sexual orientation, their attitudes towards lesbians and gay men and their judgments about the values that those beliefs expressed. In both samples, tolerant attitudes and immutability beliefs were correlated only among participants who consistently judged that immutability beliefs would be expressed by more tolerant heterosexual persons. More condemning participants judged lesbian and gay people and heterosexual people to be more fundamentally different in both samples.

Conservative management of patients with knee pain and a degenerative meniscal tear should be considered as a first-line therapy before surgical treatment is contemplated. Patients with mechanical interference of joint movements, such as painful catching or locking, might need surgical treatment with meniscal repair if possible.
