CC1601,1683841,Evolution in Archaeology,Stephen Shennan,Cultural Transmission and Evolution A Quantitative Approach,"[""Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza"", ""Marcus W. Feldman""]","A number of scholars have found that concepts such as mutation, selection, and random drift, which emerged from the theory of biological evolution, may also explain evolutionary phenomena in other disciplines as well. Drawing on these concepts, Professors Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman classify and systematize the various modes of transmitting ÒcultureÓ and explore their consequences for cultural evolution. In the process, they develop a mathematical theory of the non-genetic transmission of cultural traits that provides a framework for future investigations in quantitative social and anthropological science. The authors use quantitative models that incorporate the various modes of transmission (for example, parent-child, peer-peer, and teacher-student), and evaluate data from sociology, archaeology, and epidemiology in terms of the models. They show that the various modes of transmission in conjunction with cultural and natural selection produce various rates of cultural evolution and various degrees of diversity within and between groups. The same framework can be used for explaining phenomena as apparently unrelated as linguistics, epidemics, social values and customs, and diffusion of innovations. The authors conclude that cultural transmission is an essential factor in the study of cultural change.","Of course, the routes through which culture is inherited are much more diverse than those for genes (#AUTHOR_TAG & Feldman 1981), and different routes have different consequences for the patterning of cultural change through time.","['In the case of culture, the inheritance mechanism is social learning: People learn ways to think and act from others.', 'Of course, the routes through which culture is inherited are much more diverse than those for genes (#AUTHOR_TAG & Feldman 1981), and different routes have different consequences for the patterning of cultural change through time.', 'Variation in what is inherited is generated by innovations.', 'These may be unintended copying errors, but they can also be intentional changes, perhaps arising from trial-and-error experimentation, that lead an individual to stop doing what they had previously learned and to start doing it differently, or even to do something different altogether.', 'Whether this will be widely adopted depends on a range of selection and bias mechanisms, many of which have no equivalent in genetic evolution but whose existence and importance have formed the subject of major developments in the theory of cultural evolution over the past 30 years (especially Boyd & Richerson 1985, Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman 1981.', 'These mechanisms form the theoretical foundation for what follows and, given the complexities involved, it is important to spell them out (see also Eerkens & Lipo 2007).']",0,"['Of course, the routes through which culture is inherited are much more diverse than those for genes (#AUTHOR_TAG & Feldman 1981), and different routes have different consequences for the patterning of cultural change through time.']"
CC1602,1683841,Evolution in Archaeology,Stephen Shennan,Sedation and Cladistics: The Difference between Anagenetic and Cladogenetic Evolution,"[""R. Lee Lyman"", ""Michael J. O\u2019Brien""]","We have argued in numerous venues that a significant step in archaeological research involves the construction of evolutionary histories of cultural phenomena (Lyman and O'Brien 1998; O'Brien and Lyman 2000a, 2000b, 2002a, 2003a). These histories can concern artifacts of any scale, from design motifs on ceramic vessels, to projectile-point shapes, to architectural forms, to tool kits. A critical aspect of constructing these histories involves ascertaining the mode of evolution, by which we mean the form of the evolutionary history of a lineage. Did the members of the lineage change in a linear fashion (perhaps projectile points got consistently longer over time)? Did the members diversify over time (did the projectile points in one population get longer whereas those in another population got shorter)? Was there hybridization (did a population with long, narrow points exchange ideas with a population having short, wide points so as to produce a new kind of point)? Was there a combination of these modes of change? The evolution of a lineage is historical in the particularistic sense of being contingency bound (Simpson 1963, 1970)-minimally, the gene pool has unique spatial and temporal coordinates (Cooper 2002; Gould 1986). This does not mean, however, that determining the evolutionary history of some set of phenomena is less of a scientific endeavor than, say, calculating the atomic weight of an element (Lyman and O'Brien 2004). Indeed, it is precisely the theoretically driven nature of research on particularistic evolutionary histories that makes those histories empirically testable. The use of a theory with empirical in~plications is arguably a necessary condition of any science (Moore 2002).","This is a very well-known technique with a long history and involves putting phenomena in a linear order on the basis of some measure of their similarity to one another (#AUTHOR_TAG & O'Brien 2006, O'Brien & Lyman 2000.","['The first issue to address is whether a given diachronic sequence of archaeological observations is the result of a transmission process.', 'Clearly, transmission implies continuity but continuity does not necessarily imply transmission.', 'It might arise, for example, from the continuity of environmental conditions or of a particular function.', 'In practice, probably the most important technique for characterizing transmission has been seriation.', ""This is a very well-known technique with a long history and involves putting phenomena in a linear order on the basis of some measure of their similarity to one another (#AUTHOR_TAG & O'Brien 2006, O'Brien & Lyman 2000."", 'The assumption that things that are more similar to one another are close together in time provided an important basis for culture-historical chronology building.', 'However, with independent evidence of the chronological order, we can test whether the phenomena that are most similar to one another are indeed closest to one another in time.', 'To the extent that they are, continuity is implied.', 'Thus, if successive assemblages linked by transmission, for example, of counts of different ceramic types, are put in order, then the changing frequencies of the types will show the characteristic battleship curve pattern of first appearance, increasing popularity, and decline.', 'Ultimately, however, our conviction that cultural transmission is the predominant force accounting for the pattern is also based on other knowledge, for example, that the making of pottery is an activity acquired by social learning.', 'Other situations are a priori less clear cut.', 'Thus Schibler (2004) showed that through-time fluctuations in the proportional and absolute frequencies of wild and domestic animal bones did not relate to changing cultural preferences but to climatic fluctuations because hunting became predominant at times of a cool, wet climate, which could be demonstrated by independent evidence.']",0,"['The first issue to address is whether a given diachronic sequence of archaeological observations is the result of a transmission process.', ""This is a very well-known technique with a long history and involves putting phenomena in a linear order on the basis of some measure of their similarity to one another (#AUTHOR_TAG & O'Brien 2006, O'Brien & Lyman 2000."", 'The assumption that things that are more similar to one another are close together in time provided an important basis for culture-historical chronology building.', 'However, with independent evidence of the chronological order, we can test whether the phenomena that are most similar to one another are indeed closest to one another in time.']"

CC1604,1683841,Evolution in Archaeology,Stephen Shennan,6. An Ecological Model for the Origins of Maize-Based Food Production on the Pacific Coast of Southern Mexico,"[""Douglas J. Kennett"", ""Barbara Voorhies"", ""Dean Martorana""]","Maize-based food production was well-established on the Pacific coast of southwestern Mexico by 2600 B.P.1, the beginning of the Late Formative Period. Biogeographical and genetic studies indicate that this cultigen was originally domesticated in Central Mexico by 9200 B.P., and microbotanical studies suggest that it was widely dispersed to people living in several parts of Mexico and Central America by 7500 B.P. People living in the Soconusco region during the Archaic Period (7500Ð3500 B.P.) were foragers that may have supplemented their diets by cultivating morphologically wild plant species and some cultigens. Microbotanical studies suggest that people in this region added maize to their diets between 6000 and 5000 B.P., but a commitment to maizebased food production did not occur until 2400 years later (2600 B.P.). Based on the paleoecological record for the region and central place foraging theory, we develop a subsistence-settlement model for pre-village, Archaic Period, forager-horticulturalists and evaluate this model with the available archaeological evidence for this interval. We then use an adapted form of the LotkaVolterra predator-prey model, cultivator-cultigen, to explore the initial adoption of maize and the development of more intensive forms of maizebased food production in the area. Based on this analysis, we argue that the long-term delay between the introduction of maize and maize-based food production resulted from the relatively low energetic returns of early maize relative to other resources available in the region.","OFT is increasingly being applied to understanding past plant exploitation and food production (e.g., Barlow 2002Barlow , 2006#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2006b), and issues of risk and time-discounting are also being introduced (e.g., Tucker 2006).","['OFT is increasingly being applied to understanding past plant exploitation and food production (e.g., Barlow 2002Barlow , 2006#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2006b), and issues of risk and time-discounting are also being introduced (e.g., Tucker 2006).']",0,"['OFT is increasingly being applied to understanding past plant exploitation and food production (e.g., Barlow 2002Barlow , 2006#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2006b), and issues of risk and time-discounting are also being introduced (e.g., Tucker 2006).']"

CC1607,1683841,Evolution in Archaeology,Stephen Shennan,Showing off tests of an hypothesis about men s foraging goals,"[""Kristen Hawkes""]","It is widely assumed that among hunter-gatherers, men work to provision their families. However, men may have more to gain by giving food to a wide range of companions who treat them favorably in return. If so, and if some resources better serve this end, men's foraging behavior should vary accordingly. Aspects of this hypothesis are tested on observations of food acquisition and sharing among Ache foragers of Eastern Paraguay. Previous analysis showed that different Ache food types were differently shared. Resources shared most widely were game animals. Further analysis and additional data presented here suggest a causal association between the wide sharing of game and the fact that men hunt and women do not. Data show that men preferentially target resources in both hunting and gathering which are more widely shared, resources more likely to be consumed outside their own nuclear families. These results have implications for 1) the identification of male reproductive trade-offs in human societies, 2) the view that families are units of common interest integrated by the sexual division of labor, 3) current reconstructions of the evolution of foraging and food sharing among early hominids, and 4) assessments of the role of risk and reciprocity in hunter-gatherer foraging strategies.","The basis of this argument is that ethnographically biggame hunting does not seem to lead to calorie maximization for the hunter and his immediate family when compared with possible alternatives, but the sharing of meat that results from hunting success gives prestige and other political benefits in alliances, which lead to greater reproductive success (#AUTHOR_TAG 1991).","['Clearly the matter of distinguishing causes for patterns observed in faunal and plant remains assemblages is fundamental.', 'Inferences of resource depression as a result of human overexploitation, for example, need to exclude factors such as climate change.', 'However, some of the most interesting recent debates have concerned the nature of the fitness-related cur-rency which is being maximized in a particular context.', 'As noted above, standard models assume that the rate of energy extraction is being maximixed.', 'However, some researchers have proposed that, as far as big-game hunting is concerned, it is more probably prestige, in the context of costly signaling.', 'The basis of this argument is that ethnographically biggame hunting does not seem to lead to calorie maximization for the hunter and his immediate family when compared with possible alternatives, but the sharing of meat that results from hunting success gives prestige and other political benefits in alliances, which lead to greater reproductive success (#AUTHOR_TAG 1991).', 'Costly signaling theory, another set of ideas from BE, proposes that apparently costly or wasteful behavior can be favored by natural selection if it provides an honest signal of underlying, otherwise invisible, fitness-related qualities that are of interest to observers such as potential mates or rivals.', 'Only individuals of high quality can afford to pay the costs of the most expensive signals.', ""Bliege Bird & Smith's review (2005) of costly signaling in the context of human behavior showed that in many ethnographic contexts, costly signaling provides a coherent explanation of instances of apparently extravagant generosity or consumption."", 'Hildebrandt & McGuire (2002, McGuire & Hildebrandt 2005 have proposed that the increase in big-game hunting in the Middle Archaic of the Great Basin should be seen as representing an increase in costly signaling, which occurred because populations were increasing, leading to increased social competition and larger numbers of receivers of the costly signals being produced (cf.', 'Neiman 1997).', 'They contrast the pattern in presumptively male-dominated hunting with that indicated by the plant remains, which suggests increasing diet breadth and intensification.', 'They reject the counter arguments proposed by Byers & Broughton (2004) that the increase in big-game hunting resulted from an increase in animal populations as a result of climate change and is explicable in OF terms.', 'However, their proposal has been further criticized by Codding & Jones (2007) on the grounds, among others, that provisioning activities would always have been dominant and would therefore make up the vast proportion of faunal remains in the archaeological record, even if prestige hunting was occurring.', 'McGuire et al.

We find that data from a recently excavated Late Coalition period village on the Pajarito Plateau of New Mexico, Burnt Mesa Pueblo, exhibits less diversity in ceramic style than would be expected, if ceramic styles were ""neutral,"" using as a baseline the ceramic diversity that typifies local hamlets of the Early Coalition period. The evidence suggests that the local transmission processes affecting ceramic design were biased towards conformity (i.e., exhibit frequency-dependent bias). We take conformity in ceramic design to be one symptom of a developing social system that places great value on within-group cooperation, helping alleviate cooperative dilemmas in these early aggregates.","Neiman's original case study indicated that patterning in the rim attributes of eastern North American Woodland period pottery was a result of drift, but Shennan & Wilkinson (2001) showed that patterning in the frequency of decorative attributes of early Neolithic pottery from a small region of Germany indicated a pronovelty bias in the later periods and #AUTHOR_TAG et al. (2004) in a case study from the U.S. Southwest were able to show a departure in the direction of conformity.","['Following the logic of genetic drift, in cultural drift, variation is the result of random copying of cultural attributes, with some possibility of innovation, and the results of the process depend solely on the innovation rate and the effective population size, itself dependent on the scale of interaction.', 'It is very unlikely that any individual act of copying, for example, of a ceramic decorative motif, will be random, but if everyone has their own reasons for copying one person rather than another, the result will be that there are no directional forces affecting what or who is copied.', ""Neiman's original case study indicated that patterning in the rim attributes of eastern North American Woodland period pottery was a result of drift, but Shennan & Wilkinson (2001) showed that patterning in the frequency of decorative attributes of early Neolithic pottery from a small region of Germany indicated a pronovelty bias in the later periods and #AUTHOR_TAG et al.

The impact of prehistoric human foraging on intertidal mollusc communities and its significance for human settlement, mobility and dispersal","[""Marcello A. Mannino"", ""Kenneth D. Thomas""]","Ethnoecological studies have demonstrated the impacts that even relatively small-scale human foraging has on targeted species of shellfish and the structure of biological communities in intertidal zones. There is compelling archaeological evidence that people in various parts of the world often had a depleting effect on shellfish populations. Shellfish and other marine resources have sometimes been perceived as lowly ranked foods and coastal archaeological sites have often been interpreted as temporary (possibly seasonal) sites for the exploitation of these 'inferior' food resources. This model has been challenged by studies of mid-Holocene Mesolithic hunter-gatherer sites in Atlantic Europe, which have shown that marine foods were the main component of the total diet and that human foraging can deplete shellfish resources. Although subsistence systems based on coastal resources might have been both viable and acceptable in dietary terms, regular mobility would have been necessary for them to be sustainable. On longer time scales, such coastal mobility might result in population dispersal. Sites associated with early anatomically modern humans show the antiquity of coastal adaptations, including the consumption of shellfish, and the dispersal of early modern humans out of Africa into south-east Asia and 'Greater Australia' could have been through coastal environments. This coastal dispersal could have been driven, at least in part, by the impact of early human foragers on intertidal food resources. Resource depletion in coastal zones was probably among the first significant, but small-scale, 'ecological impacts' of human beings.","Because animal body size is correlated with handling costs and is readily assessable using archaeological faunal data, the proportion of large-bodied vs. small-bodied animal bones has very frequently been used as a diet-breadth measure (e.g., Broughton 1994; see also Ugan 2005; for within-species size variation see, e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG & Thomas 2002).","['Over the past 20 years, optimal foraging theory (OFT) has been the basis of numerous studies.', 'Researchers usually assume that people are seeking to maximize their rate of calorific intake when they are engaged in food-getting activities, on the further assumption that, other things being equal, natural selection will favor those individuals that are most efficient.', 'The diet breadth model postulates that an individual will make the choice whether to exploit a particular encountered resource by determining whether the postencounter returns obtained after pursuing (if necessary) and processing it into a form in which it can be eaten will be greater than those to be obtained by ignoring that resource and looking for something better.', 'Thus, resources can be ranked in terms of their postencounter returns.', 'Highly ranked resources will always be taken on encounter, but lower ranked ones will be ignored.', 'This principle is important and, in some respects, counterintuitive.', 'Whether a resource is exploited does not depend on its own abundance but on that of the resources ranked higher than it.', 'Resource ranks may be assessed on the basis of experimental or ethnographic work in the present (e.g., Barlow 2002, Kaplan & Hill 1992.', 'In terms of archaeological evidence, significant taphonomic and sampling issues potentially arise, but assuming that these can be overcome, faunal assemblages, for example, can be evaluated in terms of some measure of their likely productivity or resource rank.', 'Because animal body size is correlated with handling costs and is readily assessable using archaeological faunal data, the proportion of large-bodied vs. small-bodied animal bones has very frequently been used as a diet-breadth measure (e.g., Broughton 1994; see also Ugan 2005; for within-species size variation see, e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG & Thomas 2002).', 'Stiner and colleagues (2000) have used the proportions of slow-moving vs. fast-moving (and therefore hard to catch) small game as a diet breadth measure in their studies of faunal exploitation in the east Mediterranean later Palaeolithic.', 'Despite its simplicity, the diet breadth model has been remarkably successful in accounting for variation in faunal assemblages, especially in the context of diachronic sequences showing resource depression (e.g., Broughton 1997, Butler 2000.']",0,"['Because animal body size is correlated with handling costs and is readily assessable using archaeological faunal data, the proportion of large-bodied vs. small-bodied animal bones has very frequently been used as a diet-breadth measure (e.g., Broughton 1994; see also Ugan 2005; for within-species size variation see, e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG & Thomas 2002).']"

CC1613,1683841,Evolution in Archaeology,Stephen Shennan,Re-Thinking Great Basin Foragers: Prestige Hunting and Costly Signaling during the Middle Archaic Period,"[""William R. Hildebrandt"", ""Kelly R. McGuire""]","Over the last several decades, there has been an increasingly robust body of ethnographic research indicating that the sharing of meat is strongly linked to the fitness pursuits of individuals, where successful male hunters achieve various forms of prestige that ultimately lead to greater reproductive success. We argue that the effects of prestige hunting and other similar displays can be traced archaeologically in subsistence, settlement, and material culture profiles, and in the gender division of labor of even the simplest foraging societies--in this case Great Basin Middle Archaic (4500-1000 B.P.) hunter-gatherers. In contrast with optimal faraging and other efficiency models that attempt to account for such behaviors, we apply costly signaling theory to explain when foraging currencies shifted from calories to prestige among Great Basin foragers. The application of such an approach has the ability to integrate a series of disparate, subsistence- and non-subsistence-related observations regarding Great Basin lifeways and, in so doing, revise our traditional understanding of prehistoric culture change in this region.","Hildebrandt & McGuire (2002, #AUTHOR_TAG & Hildebrandt 2005 have proposed that the increase in big-game hunting in the Middle Archaic of the Great Basin should be seen as representing an increase in costly signaling, which occurred because populations were increasing, leading to increased social competition and larger numbers of receivers of the costly signals being produced (cf.","['Clearly the matter of distinguishing causes for patterns observed in faunal and plant remains assemblages is fundamental.', 'Inferences of resource depression as a result of human overexploitation, for example, need to exclude factors such as climate change.', 'However, some of the most interesting recent debates have concerned the nature of the fitness-related cur-rency which is being maximized in a particular context.', 'As noted above, standard models assume that the rate of energy extraction is being maximixed.', 'However, some researchers have proposed that, as far as big-game hunting is concerned, it is more probably prestige, in the context of costly signaling.', 'The basis of this argument is that ethnographically biggame hunting does not seem to lead to calorie maximization for the hunter and his immediate family when compared with possible alternatives, but the sharing of meat that results from hunting success gives prestige and other political benefits in alliances, which lead to greater reproductive success (Hawkes 1991).', 'Costly signaling theory, another set of ideas from BE, proposes that apparently costly or wasteful behavior can be favored by natural selection if it provides an honest signal of underlying, otherwise invisible, fitness-related qualities that are of interest to observers such as potential mates or rivals.', 'Only individuals of high quality can afford to pay the costs of the most expensive signals.', ""Bliege Bird & Smith's review (2005) of costly signaling in the context of human behavior showed that in many ethnographic contexts, costly signaling provides a coherent explanation of instances of apparently extravagant generosity or consumption."", 'Hildebrandt & McGuire (2002, #AUTHOR_TAG & Hildebrandt 2005 have proposed that the increase in big-game hunting in the Middle Archaic of the Great Basin should be seen as representing an increase in costly signaling, which occurred because populations were increasing, leading to increased social competition and larger numbers of receivers of the costly signals being produced (cf.', 'Neiman 1997).', 'They contrast the pattern in presumptively male-dominated hunting with that indicated by the plant remains, which suggests increasing diet breadth and intensification.', 'They reject the counter arguments proposed by Byers & Broughton (2004) that the increase in big-game hunting resulted from an increase in animal populations as a result of climate change and is explicable in OF terms.', 'However, their proposal has been further criticized by Codding & Jones (2007) on the grounds, among others, that provisioning activities would always have been dominant and would therefore make up the vast proportion of faunal remains in the archaeological record, even if prestige hunting was occurring.', 'McGuire et al.

This latter claim is tested by outlining the methods and approaches employed by the principal subdisciplines of evolutionary biology and assessing whether there is an existing or potential corresponding approach to the study of cultural evolution. Existing approaches within anthropology and archaeology demonstrate a good match with the macroevolutionary methods of systematics, paleobiology, and biogeography, whereas mathematical models derived from population genetics have been successfully developed to study cultural microevolution. Much potential exists for experimental simulations and field studies of cultural microevolution, where there are opportunities to borrow further methods and hypotheses from biology.

We examine these questions using data from a sample of 526 department managers in 250 car dealerships. First, the findings suggest that subjective bonuses are used to complement perceived weaknesses in quantitative performance measures and to provide employees insurance against downside risk in their pay. Specifically, use of subjective bonuses is positively related to: (1) the extent of long-term investments in intangibles; (2) the extent of organizational interdependencies; (3) the extent to which the achievability of the formula bonus target is both difficult and leads to significant consequences if not met; and (4) the presence of an operating loss. Second, we find that the effects of subjective bonuses on pay satisfaction, productivity, and profitability are larger the greater the manager's tenure, consistent with the idea that subjectivity improves incentive contracting when there is greater trust between the subordinate and supervisor.","A smaller literature considers these (e.g., Murphy & Oyer 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2004).","['Because virtually all jobs use subjectivity, it must have some benefits.', 'A smaller literature considers these (e.g., Murphy & Oyer 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2004).', 'Subjective evaluations are an alternative means by which a firm can address limitations of numeric measures.', 'Subjective evaluation allows the supervisor to incorporate her own observations about employee performance that are not reflected in a numeric measure, and allows her to do so dynamically and to incorporate ex-post settling up.']",4,"['Because virtually all jobs use subjectivity, it must have some benefits.', 'A smaller literature considers these (e.g., Murphy & Oyer 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2004).', 'Subjective evaluations are an alternative means by which a firm can address limitations of numeric measures.', 'Subjective evaluation allows the supervisor to incorporate her own observations about employee performance that are not reflected in a numeric measure, and allows her to do so dynamically and to incorporate ex-post settling up.']"

The demand for aggregation in evaluating managerial performance arises because reporting all the basic transactions and other nonfinancial information about performance is costly and impracticable (see Ashton [1982], Casey [1978], and Holmstrom and Milgrom [1987]). We identify necessary and sufficient conditions on the joint density function of the signals under which linear aggregation, a simple and commonly employed way to construct a performance evaluation measure, is optimal. This characterization suggests that the linear form of aggregation is optimal for a large class of situations. Focusing on performance measures that are linear aggregates enables us to determine the relative weights on the individual signals in the optimal linear aggregate, since these weights are invariant for all realizations of the signals.

In stark contrast to much of the work that is currently ongoing in the field of organisational performance measurement, the paper adopts a dynamic perspective. It recognises that measurement systems are not simply designed and implemented, but that they also evolve over extended periods of time. Hence, the research question which underpins the discussion is as follows: what forces shape the evolution and change of organisational performance measurement systems? To address this question the article reviews several different streams of academic literature, such as operations management, social psychology, management accounting, organisational behaviour. This synthesis results in the identification of four generic categories of force that can be said to shape the evolution and change of organisational performance measurement systems. These categories are: (i) internal influences, e.g. power relationships and dominant coalition interests; (ii) external influences, e.g. legislation and market volatility; (iii) process issues, e.g. manner of implementation and management of political processes; and (iv) transformational issues, e.g. degree of top-level support and risk of gain or loss from change. The discussion ends by presenting a framework which integrates these four different categories and explores how this can be used by: (a) members of the academic community, when researching the evolution of performance measurement systems; and (b) members of the practitioner community, when seeking to manage the evolution and change of their measurement systems.","Compensation systems have several roles beyond creating incentives (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG, Neely & Kennerly 1999;Ittner & Larcker 2002).","['Compensation systems have several roles beyond creating incentives (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG, Neely & Kennerly 1999;Ittner & Larcker 2002).', 'This fact is most evident in performance evaluation.', 'Firms may use an evaluation to monitor and reward effort.', ""However, performance also depends on factors other than effort, such as the employee's abilities, training, information, and working relationship with colleagues.""]",0,"['Compensation systems have several roles beyond creating incentives (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG, Neely & Kennerly 1999;Ittner & Larcker 2002).']"

A vast literature has failed to find consistent empirical support for this prediction, with some studies finding a positive relationship, some a negative relationship, and some no relationship at all. Prendergast's (2002) theory extends the principal-agent model to incorporate the delegation of worker authority, showing that a positive relationship between risk and incentives can arise and potentially explaining the mixed results from empirical tests. In this paper, we empirically test Prendergast's theory. Using a large, nationally-representative cross section of British establishments that includes information both from employers and from multiple workers in each establishment, we address four empirical questions: 1) Is there evidence of a risk-incentives tradeoff as predicted by the principal-agent model? 2) Is there evidence of a positive relationship between incentive pay and the delegation of worker authority as assumed by Prendergast? 3) Is there evidence of a positive relationship between risk and authority as Prendergast also assumes? 4) Is there empirical support for the main testable implication of Prendergast's model, namely that the evidence favoring a risk-incentives tradeoff should strengthen when authority controls are added to the model?

In response, incentive contracts often include important subjective components that mitigate incentive distortions caused by imperfect objective measures. This paper explores the combined use of subjective and objective performance measures in (respectively) implicit and explicit incentive contracts. Naturally, objective and subjective measures often are substitutes, sometimes strikingly so: we show that if objective measures are sufficiently close to perfect then no implicit contracts are feasible (because the firm's fallback position after reneging on an implicit contact is too attractive). We also show, however, that objective and subjective measures can reinforce each other: if objective measures become more accurate then in some circumstances the optimal contract puts more weight on subjective measures (because the improved objective measures increase the value of the ongoing relationship, and so reduce the firm's incentive to renege). We also analyze the use of subjective weights on objective performance measures, and provide case-study evidence consistent with our analyses.","Finally, subjective evaluations have their own form of uncontrollable risk for the employee: they are difficult to verify and enforce contractually, so they require relational contracting and adequate trust of the supervisor (#AUTHOR_TAG, Gibbons & Murphy 1994).","['A substantial literature discusses potential problems arising from subjective evaluation (Murphy 1992;Prendergast & Topel 1993;Murphy & Cleveland 1995;Prendergast 1999).', ""Because the evaluation is at the supervisor's discretion, supervisor preferences and incentives may play a role in the evaluation."", 'A supervisor might engage in favoritism toward some employees, or manipulate the evaluation process to reduce compensation costs.', 'Such behavior might expose the firm to legal liabilities from lawsuits alleging discrimination or wrongful termination.', 'Subjective evaluation can also distort incentives.', 'The employee might act as a ""Yes Man,"" behaving in ways the supervisor prefers and that correlate imperfectly with firm value (Prendergast 1993).', 'That employee may try to manipulate the evaluation by making negative evaluations personally costly for the supervisor (Milgrom 1988;Milgrom & Roberts 1988).', 'As a response to such influence costs, the supervisor might be too lenient or reduce the variance of evaluations (leniency and centrality biases).', 'Supervisors might also have hindsight bias, holding the employee responsible for factors that are known by the supervisor ex post, but that the employee did not know at the time he performed the work.', 'Finally, subjective evaluations have their own form of uncontrollable risk for the employee: they are difficult to verify and enforce contractually, so they require relational contracting and adequate trust of the supervisor (#AUTHOR_TAG, Gibbons & Murphy 1994).']",0,"['Finally, subjective evaluations have their own form of uncontrollable risk for the employee: they are difficult to verify and enforce contractually, so they require relational contracting and adequate trust of the supervisor (#AUTHOR_TAG, Gibbons & Murphy 1994).']"

The Economics of Climate Change. HM Treasury, London, p. 188]. The total cost of climate change was estimated to be equivalent to a one-off, permanent 5-20% loss in global mean per-capita consumption today. And the marginal damage cost of a tonne of carbon emitted today was estimated to be around $312 [p. 344]. Both of these estimates are higher than most reported in the previous literature. Subsequently, a number of critiques have appeared, arguing that discounting is the principal explanation for this discrepancy. Discounting is important, but in this paper we emphasise that how one approaches the economics of risk and uncertainty, and how one attempts to model the very closely related issue of low-probability/high-damage scenarios (which we connect to the recent discussion of 'dangerous' climate change), can matter just as much. We demonstrate these arguments empirically, using the same models applied in the Stern Review. Together, the issues of risk and uncertainty on the one hand, and 'dangerous' climate change on the other, raise very strongly questions about the limits of a welfare-economic approach, where the loss of natural capital might be irreversible and impossible to compensate. Thus we also critically reflect on the state-of-the-art in integrated assessment modelling. There will always be an imperative to carry out integrated assessment modelling, bringing together scientific 'fact' and value judgement systematically. But we agree with those cautioning against a literal interpretation of current estimates. Ironically, the Stern Review is one of those voices.

We trace this finding to the contestable assumptions and limitations of IAMs. For example, they typically discount future impacts from climate change at relatively high rates. This practice may be appropriate for short-term financial decisions but its extension to intergenerational environmental issues rests on several empirically and philosophically controversial hypotheses. IAMs also assign monetary values to the benefits of climate mitigation on the basis of incomplete information and sometimes speculative judgments concerning the monetary worth of human lives and ecosystems, while downplaying scientific uncertainty about the extent of expected damages. In addition, IAMs may exaggerate mitigation costs by failing to reflect the socially determined, path-dependent nature of technical change and ignoring the potential savings from reduced energy utilization and other opportunities for innovation. A better approach to climate policy, drawing on recent research on the economics of uncertainty, would reframe the problem as buying insurance against catastrophic, low-probability events. Policy decisions should be based on a judgment concerning the maximum tolerable increase in temperature and/or carbon dioxide levels given the state of scientific understanding. The appropriate role for economists would then be to determine the least-cost global strategy to achieve that target. While this remains a demanding and complex problem, it is far more tractable and epistemically defensible than the cost-benefit comparisons attempted by most IAMs.","Inevitably, IAMs rely on a series of simplifying assumptions, using highly aggregated variables and data (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009a;Patt et al. 2010), and the limitations of the methodology have been noted (e.g. Warren et al. 2006, Dietz et al. 2007).","['Inevitably, IAMs rely on a series of simplifying assumptions, using highly aggregated variables and data (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009a;Patt et al. 2010), and the limitations of the methodology have been noted (e.g. Warren et al. 2006, Dietz et al. 2007).', 'Nevertheless, IAMs provide a useful conceptual framework for exploring the implications of alternative specifications.', 'Furthermore, many IAMs are designed to be flexible Nordhaus and Boyer 2000, allowing users the opportunity to enter alternative parameters.', 'As noted in Dietz et al.

To prevent these and limit long-term global surface warming to, for example, 2 ¡C, a level of stabilization or of peak atmospheric CO2 concentrations needs to be set. Climate sensitivity, the global equilibrium surface warming after a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration, can help with the translation of atmospheric CO2 levels to warming. Various observations favour a climate sensitivity value of about 3 ¡C, with a likely range of about 2Ð4.5 ¡C. However, the physics of the response and uncertainties in forcing lead to fundamental difficulties in ruling out higher values. The quest to determine climate sensitivity has now been going on for decades, with disturbingly little progress in narrowing the large uncertainty range. However, in the process, fascinating new insights into the climate system and into policy aspects regarding mitigation have been gained. The well-constrained lower limit of climate sensitivity and the transient rate of warming already provide useful information for policy makers.

Direct measurement techniques are still lacking to extend these observations to 3 dimensions. Sequential sectioning of soils, followed by 2-dimensional mapping of chemical elements and geometric interpolation to 3D, appears to be the only available alternative. Unfortunately, sectioning of soil samples suffers from geometric distortions that are difficult to avoid in practise. In this regard, the objective of the research described in this article was to develop a procedure enabling one to locate, in a 3D X-ray microtomographic image of a soil sample, a physical surface that is obtained by sectioning and for which a number of chemical maps are available. This procedure involves three steps: (1) the reconstitution of the physical structure of the soil layer surface, (2) the alignment of the chemical maps with the reconstituted soil surface image, and (3) the 3D alignment of the 2D chemical maps with the internal structure of the soil cube. Visual comparison of the C and Si maps and of the reconstituted CT images of the layer surfaces suggests a good correspondence between them, which is supported by Pearson correlation coefficients of - 0.57, - 0.58, 0.45, and 0.43 for the different surfaces and elements considered. Relative to the original 3D X-ray CT image of the soil sample, the planes associated with the C and Si maps, respectively, are nearly superposed, which further confirms the validity of the alignment procedure.","Significant advances related to biological markers now allow specific bacteria to be identified in soils and their spatial distribution at micrometric scales to be determined in thin sections (Eickhorst and Tippk�_tter, 2008a,b), and this information can be translated into 3-dimensional distributions using recently developed statistical algorithms (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).","['An increasingly accepted explanation of the lack of progress regarding the processes that control the fate of carbon in soils is that traditional macroscopic measurements (e.g., of organic matter content, microbial population density, or genetic diversity) are unable to capture, even qualitatively, the key features of microbial activity in soils, and that crucial aspects of the intricate conformation of microbial micro-environments at sub-macroscopic scales are being missed (Baveye et al., 2011;Baveye and Laba, 2014).', 'Therefore, to address the challenges facing soils, we need urgently to (1) be able to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties at the micrometric scale, directly relevant to microorganisms, (2) try to understand experimentally how microorganisms relate to their physical environment at that scale, and (3) develop models that encapsulate this information and make predictions of future trends possible.', 'The very same needs arise in terms of the processes that underlie plant-soil feedback mechanisms.', 'This assessment is not new.', 'More than years ago already, various authors (e.g., Alexander, 1964) argued that progress in many areas of soil microbiology required that quantitative observations be made at the scale of microorganisms.', 'Unfortunately, researchers could do very little along these lines at the time, because of a lack of appropriate technologies.', 'For many years, the only equipment that was of any help in this respect was the scanning electron microscope, which could be used to visualize microbial micro-environments in soils (Foster, 1988), but unfortunately delivered no quantitative or spatial data.', 'This situation has changed dramatically in the last few years.', 'Significant technological advances have provided soil researchers with routine access to X-ray computed tomography systems, which, as methodological roadblocks are being resolved (e.g., Elliot and Heck, 2007;Iassonov et al., 2009;Baveye et al., 2010;Iassonov and Tuller, 2010;Hapca et al., 2013;Houston et al., 2013a,b), increasingly provide reliable information about the geometry of pores and solids in soils at resolutions as small as 0.5 �m.', 'Concomitant progress in near-edge X-ray spectromicroscopy (NEXAFS), synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and synchrotron-based micro-fluorescence spectroscopy of thin sections of soils has led to observations of sharp spatial heterogeneity in the chemical make-up of soil organic matter over minute distances, respectively of the order of nanometers to micrometers (Schumacher et al., 2005;Wan et al., 2007), and in the accumulation of trace metals (Jacobson et al., 2007;Baker, 2008, 2009;Prietzel et al., 2010;Thieme et al., 2010).', 'Significant advances related to biological markers now allow specific bacteria to be identified in soils and their spatial distribution at micrometric scales to be determined in thin sections (Eickhorst and Tippk�_tter, 2008a,b), and this information can be translated into 3-dimensional distributions using recently developed statistical algorithms (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).', 'In addition, very efficient modeling tools, like the Lattice-Boltzmann model, allow the description of transport and physico-chemical processes occurring in soil pores at scales directly relevant to microorganisms (e.g., Vogel et al., 2005;Falconer et al., 2012;Genty and Pot, 2013), whereas individual-based models, also developing rapidly (Gras et al., 2010), can describe the dynamics of small groups of microorganisms inhabiting the pore space (e.g., Garnier et al., 2008).']",0,"['Significant advances related to biological markers now allow specific bacteria to be identified in soils and their spatial distribution at micrometric scales to be determined in thin sections (Eickhorst and Tippk�_tter, 2008a,b), and this information can be translated into 3-dimensional distributions using recently developed statistical algorithms (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).']"

Baveye"", ""David Rangel"", ""Astrid R. Jacobson"", ""Magdeline Laba"", ""Christophe Darnault"", ""Wilfred Otten"", ""Ricardo Radulovich"", ""Flavio A. O. Camargo""]","Since the late 1970s, thousands of scholarly articles, books and reports have dealt with the application of the mathematical theory of geostatistics to characterize the spatial ""variability"" of soils, and to produce soil property maps. Insensibly, this application of geostatistics appears to have become an end in itself, and the reasons why one should be concerned about the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties are rarely if ever made clear any more. In this context, the purpose of the present critical review article is to return to some of the primal questions that motivated this interest in the topic several decades ago. After a brief review of the background behind the application of geostatistics to soils, a number of situations and modeling efforts are described where, even though soils undoubtedly vary spatially, nothing seems to be gained practically by explicitly accounting for their spatial heterogeneity in order to reach a number of management or research objectives. Contrastedly, whenever the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties in the field might be relevant, it is shown that very different perceptions about it emerge, depending on the type of measurement that is performed. This suggests that the approach one adopts to characterize spatially-varying soil properties should be dictated by whatever goal one pursues. For example, if the objective is to evaluate the ""ecosystem services"" of soils in a given region and to reach decisions about them, one should probably first consider the (typically large) spatial scale that is most relevant to the decision-making process, then proceed via a top-down approach to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of soil services, if and when appropriate.

Here we present results of the pilot phase of the project, designed to develop and compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95% of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10[superscript -8] per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites.

This paper performs a systematic review of published and unpublished methods to automate data extraction for systematic reviews. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, IEEEXplore, and ACM Digital Library to identify potentially relevant articles. We included reports that met the following criteria: 1) methods or results section described what entities were or need to be extracted, and 2) at least one entity was automatically extracted with evaluation results that were presented for that entity. We also reviewed the citations from included reports. Results: Out of a total of 1190 unique citations that met our search criteria, we found 26 published reports describing automatic extraction of at least one of more than 52 potential data elements used in systematic reviews. For 25 (48 %) of the data elements used in systematic reviews, there were attempts from various researchers to extract information automatically from the publication text. Out of these, 14 (27 %) data elements were completely extracted, but the highest number of data elements extracted automatically by a single study was 7. Most of the data elements were extracted with F-scores (a mean of sensitivity and positive predictive value) of over 70 %.

The second step attempts to discover relations between the entity pairs extracted from the whole set of clinical records. For this last step we investigate the performance of unsupervised methods such as clustering in the space of entity pairs, represented by an ad hoc feature vector. The resulting clusters are then automatically labelled by using the most significant features. The system has been tested on a fairly large data set of clinical records in Italian, investigating the variation in the performance adopting different similarity measures in the feature space.

Authors of systematic reviews typically define a Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (a PICO criteria) of interest, and then retrieve, appraise and synthesize results from all reports of clinical trials that meet these criteria. Identifying PICO elements in the full-texts of trial reports is thus a critical yet time-consuming step in the systematic review process. We seek to expedite evidence synthesis by developing machine learning models to automatically extract sentences from articles relevant to PICO elements. Collecting a large corpus of training data for this task would be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we derive distant supervision (DS) with which to train models using previously conducted reviews. DS entails heuristically deriving 'soft' labels from an available structured resource. However, we have access only to unstructured, free-text summaries of PICO elements for corresponding articles; we must derive from these the desired sentence-level annotations. To this end, we propose a novel method - supervised distant supervision (SDS) - that uses a small amount of direct supervision to better exploit a large corpus of distantly labeled instances by learning to pseudo-annotate articles using the available DS.

Contrary to classical systems, Deep Learning models can learn the representation of the data automatically without an expert domain knowledge and avoid the tedious and time-consuming task of defining relevant features.  A Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI), which is an essential subset of Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR),  represents the alterations in the effects of drugs that were taken simultaneously. The early  recognition of interacting drugs is a vital process that prevents serious health problems that can  cause death in the worst cases. Health-care professionals and researchers in this domain find the  task of discovering information about these incidents very challenging due to the vast number  of pharmacovigilance documents. For this reason, several shared tasks and datasets have been  developed in order to solve this issue with automated annotation systems with the capability  to extract this information. In the present document, the DDI corpus, which is an annotated  dataset of DDIs, is used with Deep Learning architectures without any external information  for the tasks of Name Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction in order to validate the  hypothesis. Furthermore, some other datasets are tested to evidence the performance of these  systems.  To sum up, the results suggest that the most common Deep Learning methods like Convolutional  Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks overcome the traditional algorithms  concluding that Deep Learning is a real alternative for a specific and complex scenario like the  Information Extraction in the Biomedical domain. As a final goal, a complete architecture that  covers the two tasks is developed to structure the named entities and their relationships from  raw pharmacological texts.This thesis has been supported by:  Pre-doctoral research training scholarship of the Carlos III University of Madrid (PIF UC3M 02-1415) for four years.

When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, ""powerful,"" ""strong"" and ""Paris"" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models.

As part of these efforts, it is important to catalog, from widely dispersed sources, the toxicology information that is available. The main objective of this analysis is to define a list of environmental chemicals that are candidates for the U.S. EPA screening and prioritization process, and to catalog the available toxicology information. Data sources: We are developing ACToR (Aggregated Computational Toxicology Resource), which combines information for hundreds of thousands of chemicals from > 200 public sources, including the U.S. EPA, National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration, corresponding agencies in Canada, Europe, and Japan, and academic sources. Data extraction: ACToR contains chemical structure information; physical-chemical properties; in vitro assay data; tabular in vivo data; summary toxicology calls (e.g., a statement that a chemical is considered to be a human carcinogen); and links to online toxicology summaries.

Much progress has been made in the design of rule-based and supervised tools, but they are often genre and task dependent. As such, adapting them to different genres of text or identifying new types of entities requires major effort in re-annotation or rule development. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to extracting named entities from biomedical text. We describe a stepwise solution to tackle the challenges of entity boundary detection and entity type classification without relying on any handcrafted rules, heuristics, or annotated data. A noun phrase chunker followed by a filter based on inverse document frequency extracts candidate entities from free text. Classification of candidate entities into categories of interest is carried out by leveraging principles from distributional semantics.

R. Burton"", ""A. L. Hansell"", ""I. Fortier"", ""T. A. Manolio"", ""M. J. Khoury"", ""J. Little"", ""P. Elliott""]","Despite earlier doubts, a string of recent successes indicates that if sample sizes are large enough, it is possible-both in theory and in practice-to identify and replicate genetic associations with common complex diseases. But human genome epidemiology is expensive and, from a strategic perspective, it is still unclear what 'large enough' really means. This question has critical implications for governments, funding agencies, bioscientists and the tax-paying public. Difficult strategic decisions with imposing price tags and important opportunity costs must be taken.Conventional power calculations for case-control studies disregard many basic elements of analytic complexity-e.g. errors in clinical assessment, and the impact of unmeasured aetiological determinants-and can seriously underestimate true sample size requirements. This article describes, and applies, a rigorous simulation-based approach to power calculation that deals more comprehensively with analytic complexity and has been implemented on the web as ESPRESSO: (www.p3gobservatory.org/powercalculator.htm).Using this approach, the article explores the realistic power profile of stand-alone and nested case-control studies in a variety of settings and provides a robust quantitative foundation for determining the required sample size both of individual biobanks and of large disease-based consortia. Despite universal acknowledgment of the importance of large sample sizes, our results suggest that contemporary initiatives are still, at best, at the lower end of the range of desirable sample size. Insufficient power remains particularly problematic for studies exploring gene-gene or gene-environment interactions. Discussion Sample size calculation must be both accurate and realistic, and we must continue to strengthen national and international cooperation in the design, conduct, harmonization and integration of studies in human genome epidemiology.","In seeking to exploit the potential of genomics and other molecular analytical techniques, increasing emphases on differentiation and stratification of target objectives and populations have emerged, while challenges in establishing statistically significant associations between diseases and disease markers require data of ever larger target populationsboth healthy subjects as well as patients (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009).","['The role played by human tissue and data, and the value attached to it, in research is now shifting along with novel approaches and techniques of biomedicine.', 'Instead of focusing on causal mechanisms, health and disease are frequently understood nowadays in terms of risks and aiming for differentiation and stratification of diseases and disease populations.', 'In order to accommodate that shift, resource provision for research has changed dramatically in scale, scope and systematic nature over the last decades.', 'In seeking to exploit the potential of genomics and other molecular analytical techniques, increasing emphases on differentiation and stratification of target objectives and populations have emerged, while challenges in establishing statistically significant associations between diseases and disease markers require data of ever larger target populationsboth healthy subjects as well as patients (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009).', ""While often grouped together under the heading of 'personalized medicine' , current approaches to biomedical research therefore involve more than just individualized, stratified and differentiated forms of intervention, but also new forms of population-level surveillance (Raman and Tutton 2010)."", 'The emergence of biobanking is considered a chief enabling factor for these shifts.']",0,"['The role played by human tissue and data, and the value attached to it, in research is now shifting along with novel approaches and techniques of biomedicine.', 'Instead of focusing on causal mechanisms, health and disease are frequently understood nowadays in terms of risks and aiming for differentiation and stratification of diseases and disease populations.', 'In seeking to exploit the potential of genomics and other molecular analytical techniques, increasing emphases on differentiation and stratification of target objectives and populations have emerged, while challenges in establishing statistically significant associations between diseases and disease markers require data of ever larger target populationsboth healthy subjects as well as patients (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009).', ""While often grouped together under the heading of 'personalized medicine' , current approaches to biomedical research therefore involve more than just individualized, stratified and differentiated forms of intervention, but also new forms of population-level surveillance (Raman and Tutton 2010).""]"

Here we explore in more detail the ways in which we understand the boundaries of bio-objects determined through a Òbio-objectificationÓ process wherein life-forms or living entities are first made into objects, become possible, through scientific labor and its associated technologies, and then come to be attributed with specific identities. This move from living entity, through bio-objectification to what we can call Òbio-identificationÓ helps us to understand the contested, often controversial process seen in the biological sciences (and not merely in biomedicine, but elsewhere, such as in agriculture and food research) where we see a new mixture of relations to life or to which ÒlifeÓ is attributed, such as animal-human hybrids, chimera, genetically modified organisms, or transgenics. As a consequence of these novel relations, the boundaries between human and animal, organic and nonorganic, living and the suspension of living (and the meaning of death itself), are often questioned and destabilized, and their identities have to be negotiated and (temporarily) stabilized, and so given an identity. What is common to what we call bio-objects, is that they all in various ways challenge conventional cultural, scientific, and institutional orderings and classifications.","Recent scholarly work within science and technology studies (STS) has sought to develop a series of analytical tools for recognizing how such reconfigurations are taking place, and understanding their implications for current understandings of life (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2011;Vermeulen et al. 2012;Metzler and Webster 2011a;Hansen and Metzler 2012;Tamminen and Vermeulen 2012;Douglas et al. 2012a;Bock von W�_lfingen 2012;Maeseele et al. 2013;Martinelli et al. 2013;Svalastog and Martinelli 2013;Ca��ada 2013).","['In this article, we show how resources of clinical biobanking (i.e.', 'human tissue and health data) link up and transgress commonly held distinctions between research and care in multiple ways.', 'Recent scholarly work within science and technology studies (STS) has sought to develop a series of analytical tools for recognizing how such reconfigurations are taking place, and understanding their implications for current understandings of life (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2011;Vermeulen et al. 2012;Metzler and Webster 2011a;Hansen and Metzler 2012;Tamminen and Vermeulen 2012;Douglas et al. 2012a;Bock von W�_lfingen 2012;Maeseele et al. 2013;Martinelli et al. 2013;Svalastog and Martinelli 2013;Ca��ada 2013).', 'Drawing on the concepts and interpretive toolkit of bio-objectification (Vermeulen et al. 2012;Metzler and Webster 2011a;Holmberg et al. 2011), we trace how relationships and boundaries between research and clinical care are reconfigured through changes in the resources, their associated practices and the way these are governed in biomedical research.', ""The notion of 'bio-objectification' calls attention to the ranges of work devoted to the exploration and fashioning of new forms of life."", 'As these novel configurations disturb previously established boundaries, labour is undertaken to render bio-objects stable and both demarcate them and associate them with other forms and aspects of life (Holmberg et al. 2011).', ""Such labour, involving many different practical, technical, legal and social aspects, can lead to 'bio-objects' such as frozen gametes that sit on the boundary of the living and non-living as they are simultaneously inanimate and sources of vitality (Tamminen 2013), or microRNA that challenges the boundary between human and nonhumans as it migrates from plants to regulate mammalian genes (Chrupek et al. 2012).""]",4,"['Recent scholarly work within science and technology studies (STS) has sought to develop a series of analytical tools for recognizing how such reconfigurations are taking place, and understanding their implications for current understandings of life (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2011;Vermeulen et al. 2012;Metzler and Webster 2011a;Hansen and Metzler 2012;Tamminen and Vermeulen 2012;Douglas et al. 2012a;Bock von W�_lfingen 2012;Maeseele et al. 2013;Martinelli et al. 2013;Svalastog and Martinelli 2013;Ca��ada 2013).', 'Drawing on the concepts and interpretive toolkit of bio-objectification (Vermeulen et al. 2012;Metzler and Webster 2011a;Holmberg et al. 2011), we trace how relationships and boundaries between research and clinical care are reconfigured through changes in the resources, their associated practices and the way these are governed in biomedical research.', ""The notion of 'bio-objectification' calls attention to the ranges of work devoted to the exploration and fashioning of new forms of life."", 'As these novel configurations disturb previously established boundaries, labour is undertaken to render bio-objects stable and both demarcate them and associate them with other forms and aspects of life (Holmberg et al. 2011).']"

Our hope for medical progress increasingly depends on the willingness of the worldÕs poor to participate in clinical drug trials. While these experiments often provide those in need with vital and previously unattainable medical resources, the outsourcing and offshoring of trials also create new problems. In this groundbreaking book, anthropologist Adriana Petryna takes us deep into the clinical trials industry as it brings together players separated by vast economic and cultural differences. Moving between corporate and scientific offices in the United States and research and public health sites in Poland and Brazil, When Experiments Travel documents the complex ways that commercial medical science, with all its benefits and risks, is being integrated into local health systems and emerging drug markets. Providing a unique perspective on globalized clinical trials, When Experiments Travel raises central questions: Are such trials exploitative or are they social goods? How are experiments controlled and how is drug safety ensured? And do these experiments help or harm public health in the countries where they are conducted? Empirically rich and theoretically innovative, the book shows that neither the language of coercion nor that of rational choice fully captures the range of situations and value systems at work in medical experiments today. When Experiments Travel challenges conventional understandings of the ethics and politics of transnational science and changes the way we think about global medicine and the new infrastructures of our lives.","In medical sociology and STS the relationships between research and care have been explored in a number of ways, particularly through addressing the ways in which medical uncertainties are dealt with by practitioners and researchers (Fox 1997;Timmermans and Angell 2001;Alderson 2014); the consequences of intertwining research and care at the level of clinical practice (L�_wy 1996;Timmermans 2010;Wadmann and Hoeyer 2014); the role of clinical trials as a constitutive component of clinical cancer care (Keating and Cambrosio 2012); as well as the ways in which changing practices and processes of research and drug development affect the organization and practice of clinical care and public health (Fisher 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG 2009).","['The emergence of clinical biobanking is associated with general shifts in biomedical research towards an investigation of the molecular level to understand and intervene in mechanisms of disease, particularly with the uptake of genomics in in clinical research and medicine.', 'In turn, those shifts bring with them a hugely different role for human tissue and data as well as major changes in the ways in which tissue and data moves between research and care.', 'These shifts provide a novel occasion for investigating relationships between research and care.', 'In medical sociology and STS the relationships between research and care have been explored in a number of ways, particularly through addressing the ways in which medical uncertainties are dealt with by practitioners and researchers (Fox 1997;Timmermans and Angell 2001;Alderson 2014); the consequences of intertwining research and care at the level of clinical practice (L�_wy 1996;Timmermans 2010;Wadmann and Hoeyer 2014); the role of clinical trials as a constitutive component of clinical cancer care (Keating and Cambrosio 2012); as well as the ways in which changing practices and processes of research and drug development affect the organization and practice of clinical care and public health (Fisher 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG 2009).', 'Our research touches on the latter focus in particular.', ""Analogously to the 'experimentalization' of clinical care for drug development, the reconfiguration of clinical care to accommodate biobanking can be understood as a way in which care practices are changed in order to feed into and accommodate broader research objectives.""]",0,"['In medical sociology and STS the relationships between research and care have been explored in a number of ways, particularly through addressing the ways in which medical uncertainties are dealt with by practitioners and researchers (Fox 1997;Timmermans and Angell 2001;Alderson 2014); the consequences of intertwining research and care at the level of clinical practice (L�_wy 1996;Timmermans 2010;Wadmann and Hoeyer 2014); the role of clinical trials as a constitutive component of clinical cancer care (Keating and Cambrosio 2012); as well as the ways in which changing practices and processes of research and drug development affect the organization and practice of clinical care and public health (Fisher 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG 2009).']"

This article reports recommendations from a 2-year project funded by the National Institutes of Health. We analyze the responsibilities involved in managing the return of incidental findings and individual research results in a biobank research system (primary research or collection sites, the biobank itself, and secondary research sites). We suggest that biobanks shoulder significant responsibility for seeing that the biobank research system addresses the return question explicitly. When reidentification of individual contributors is possible, the biobank should work to enable the biobank research system to discharge four core responsibilities to (1) clarify the criteria for evaluating findings and the roster of returnable findings, (2) analyze a particular finding in relation to this, (3) reidentify the individual contributor, and (4) recontact the contributor to offer the finding.

In this essay, we consider a particular kind of collection, national biobanks. National biobanks are often presented by advocates as an economic ""resource"" that will be used by both basic researchers and academic biologists, as well as by pharmaceutical diagnostic and clinical genomics companies. Although national biobanks have been the subject of intense interest in recent social science literature, most prior work on this topic focuses either on bioethical issues related to biobanks, such as the question of informed consent, or on the possibilities for scientific citizenship that they make possible. We emphasize, by contrast, the economic aspect of biobanks, focusing specifically on the way in which national biobanks create biovalue. Our emphasis on the economic aspect of biobanks allows us to recognize the importance of what we call clinical labor-that is, the regularized, embodied work that members of the national population are expected to perform in their role as biobank participants-in the creation of biovalue through biobanks. Moreover, it allows us to understand how the technical way in which national biobanks link clinical labor to databases alters both medical and popular understandings of risk for common diseases and conditions.","At the same time, the labour performed by most donors is also minimized and made invisible by integrating it into routine aspects of care (#AUTHOR_TAG and Waldby 2010;Mitchell 2012).","['A third process of bio-objectification relates to the patients participating in these clinical biobanking endeavors and the roles they are expected to take up vis-�_-vis the tissue and data procured from them.', 'Through large-scale forms of resource provision embedded into practical routines and infrastructures for healthcare, patients are turned into regular contributors to the clinical research enterprise.', 'This is reflected in terminology involved to describe their role.', ""Instead of the use of language such as 'research subjects' , contributing human tissue and data is now often framed as an act of 'donating' , which a term previously reserved for more tangible donations dedicated to others' well-being such as through blood donations (Tutton 2002)."", ""A case in point is that in 2011 Dutch professional guidelines for responsible use of human tissue in biomedical research routinely speak of 'donors' and 'donations'; yet, in 2001 the terminology used was 'betrokkene' (i.e."", ""someone who's involved) (Federatie van Medisch-Wetenschappelijke Verenigingen (FEDERA) 2001; Federatie van Medisch-Wetenschappelijke Verenigingen (Federa) ( 2011))."", ""Some scholars have referred to this process as involving new forms of 'clinical' and 'immaterial labor'."", 'At the same time, the labour performed by most donors is also minimized and made invisible by integrating it into routine aspects of care (#AUTHOR_TAG and Waldby 2010;Mitchell 2012).', 'In order to achieve high rates of donation, the success of clinical biobanking is considered to depend on its unobtrusiveness and on not being seen to overburden patients in their donations.', 'This is reflected in concerted efforts in PSI to minimize the work and time expended on biobanking for patients, research nurses and clinicians by integrating tissue and data procurement as efficiently as possible in day-to-day clinical care.', 'These adjustments in clinical routines, which also involve mundane aspects such as training of research nurses and timing of clinical appointments, are forms of bio-objectification that allow for patients\' data and tissue to be swiftly transformed into ""workable epistemic objects"" (Eriksson and Webster 2015).']",2,"['A third process of bio-objectification relates to the patients participating in these clinical biobanking endeavors and the roles they are expected to take up vis-_-vis the tissue and data procured from them.', 'Through large-scale forms of resource provision embedded into practical routines and infrastructures for healthcare, patients are turned into regular contributors to the clinical research enterprise.', 'At the same time, the labour performed by most donors is also minimized and made invisible by integrating it into routine aspects of care (#AUTHOR_TAG and Waldby 2010;Mitchell 2012).', 'In order to achieve high rates of donation, the success of clinical biobanking is considered to depend on its unobtrusiveness and on not being seen to overburden patients in their donations.', 'This is reflected in concerted efforts in PSI to minimize the work and time expended on biobanking for patients, research nurses and clinicians by integrating tissue and data procurement as efficiently as possible in day-to-day clinical care.']"

These measures have in turn led to heavy administrative, logistical, and financial costs and attracted criticism for unduly impeding disease research. Based on a newly formulated approach to solidarity, we propose an approach to governance that recognises people's willingness to participate in a public research biobank, and poses stronger emphasis on harm mitigation.

D. Coenen""]","A nerve cell receives multiple inputs from upstream neurons by way of its synapses. Neuron processing functions are thus influenced by changes in the biophysical properties of the synapse, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD). This observation has opened new perspectives on the biophysical basis of learning and memory, but its quantitative impact on the information transmission of a neuron remains partially elucidated. One major obstacle is the high dimensionality of the neuronal input-output space, which makes it unfeasible to perform a thorough computational analysis of a neuron with multiple synaptic inputs. In this work, information theory was employed to characterize the information transmission of a cerebellar granule cell over a region of its excitatory input space following synaptic changes. Granule cells have a small dendritic tree (on average, they receive only four mossy fiber afferents), which greatly bounds the input combinatorial space, reducing the complexity of information-theoretic calculations. Numerical simulations and LTP experiments quantified how changes in neurotransmitter release probability (p) modulated information transmission of a cerebellar granule cell. Numerical simulations showed that p shaped the neurotransmission landscape in unexpected ways. As p increased, the optimality of the information transmission of most stimuli did not increase strictly monotonically; instead it reached a plateau at intermediate p levels. Furthermore, our results showed that the spatiotemporal characteristics of the inputs determine the effect of p on neurotransmission, thus permitting the selection of distinctive preferred stimuli for different p values. These selective mechanisms may have important consequences on the encoding of cerebellar mossy fiber inputs and the plasticity and computation at the next circuit stage, including the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses","This peculiarity of GrCs response patterns lead to a low output variability #AUTHOR_TAG which, in turn, greatly reduces the complexity of calculations and the duration of recording sessions.","['The cerebellar cortical circuit is an optimal preparation to calculate MI by virtue of a reduced input-output combination.', 'In response to mossy fibers (mf) inputs, cerebellar (GrCs) respond with stereotyped patterns displaying a limited number of spikes (typically two or less [19,20]) which are confined in a restricted time window, by the intervention of Golgi cells inhibition [21,22].', 'Furthermore, although the presence of non-triggered spikes could contribute to increase response variability, spontaneous firing of GrCs in acute slices has never been observed.', 'This peculiarity of GrCs response patterns lead to a low output variability #AUTHOR_TAG which, in turn, greatly reduces the complexity of calculations and the duration of recording sessions.', 'The cerebellar circuitry can thus be used as a model to investigate the alterations induced by general anesthetics on neuronal circuit functioning.', 'In addition, the interaction of general anesthetics with cerebellum has been poorly examined albeit several reports show functional changes of cerebellar activity during anesthesia [24][25][26][27].']",5,"['The cerebellar cortical circuit is an optimal preparation to calculate MI by virtue of a reduced input-output combination.', 'In response to mossy fibers (mf) inputs, cerebellar (GrCs) respond with stereotyped patterns displaying a limited number of spikes (typically two or less [19,20]) which are confined in a restricted time window, by the intervention of Golgi cells inhibition [21,22].', 'Furthermore, although the presence of non-triggered spikes could contribute to increase response variability, spontaneous firing of GrCs in acute slices has never been observed.', 'This peculiarity of GrCs response patterns lead to a low output variability #AUTHOR_TAG which, in turn, greatly reduces the complexity of calculations and the duration of recording sessions.', 'The cerebellar circuitry can thus be used as a model to investigate the alterations induced by general anesthetics on neuronal circuit functioning.', 'In addition, the interaction of general anesthetics with cerebellum has been poorly examined albeit several reports show functional changes of cerebellar activity during anesthesia [24][25][26][27].']"

Such information has been difficult to obtain because of the small size and inaccessibility of nerve terminals in the central nervous system. Here we show, by making direct patch-clamp recordings in vivo from cerebellar mossy fibre boutons-the primary source of synaptic input to the cerebellar cortex-that sensory stimulation can produce bursts of spikes in single boutons at very high instantaneous firing frequencies (more than 700 Hz). We show that the mossy fibre-granule cell synapse exhibits high-fidelity transmission at these frequencies, indicating that the rapid burst of excitatory postsynaptic currents underlying the sensory-evoked response of granule cells can be driven by such a presynaptic spike burst. We also demonstrate that a single mossy fibre can trigger action potential bursts in granule cells in vitro when driven with in vivo firing patterns. These findings suggest that the relay from mossy fibre to granule cell can act in a 'detonator' fashion, such that a single presynaptic afferent may be sufficient to transmit the sensory message. This endows the cerebellar mossy fibre system with remarkable sensitivity and high fidelity in the transmission of sensory information.","The cerebellar granular layer microcircuit allows to obtain MI quantification between mf and GrCs because: i) mf inputs are conveyed through high-frequency bursts (up to 500Hz [38,#AUTHOR_TAG]) that have been well characterized, enabling a proper representation of the input space [30,40]; ii) in cerebellar slices GrCs are silent when mf are severed, reducing spontaneous firing and output variability; iii) in response to mf activation, GrCs generate only few spikes (typically less than 3-4) with a maximum output frequency of 100-150 Hz, reducing the output response space.","['The correct calculation of MI derives from an accurate estimation of probabilities to be inserted into the equation.', 'Experimental limitations provoke fluctuations which, in turn, alter the estimation of probabilities.', 'This bias can be only overcome by increasing the number of repetitions and by employing a system with a reduced variability of neuronal responses.', 'The cerebellar granular layer microcircuit allows to obtain MI quantification between mf and GrCs because: i) mf inputs are conveyed through high-frequency bursts (up to 500Hz [38,#AUTHOR_TAG]) that have been well characterized, enabling a proper representation of the input space [30,40]; ii) in cerebellar slices GrCs are silent when mf are severed, reducing spontaneous firing and output variability; iii) in response to mf activation, GrCs generate only few spikes (typically less than 3-4) with a maximum output frequency of 100-150 Hz, reducing the output response space.']",0,"['The cerebellar granular layer microcircuit allows to obtain MI quantification between mf and GrCs because: i) mf inputs are conveyed through high-frequency bursts (up to 500Hz [38,#AUTHOR_TAG]) that have been well characterized, enabling a proper representation of the input space [30,40]; ii) in cerebellar slices GrCs are silent when mf are severed, reducing spontaneous firing and output variability; iii) in response to mf activation, GrCs generate only few spikes (typically less than 3-4) with a maximum output frequency of 100-150 Hz, reducing the output response space.']"

Central to this role is the inhibitory action exerted by Golgi cells over granule cells: Golgi cells inhibit granule cells through both feedforward and feedback inhibitory loops and generate a broad lateral inhibition that extends beyond the afferent synaptic field. This characteristic connectivity has recently been investigated in great detail and been correlated with specific functional properties of these neurons. These include theta-frequency pacemaking, network entrainment into coherent oscillations and phase resetting. Important advances have also been made in terms of determining the membrane and synaptic properties of the neuron, and clarifying the mechanisms of activation by input bursts. Moreover, voltage sensitive dye imaging and multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings, combined with mathematical simulations based on realistic computational models, have improved our understanding of the impact of Golgi cell activity on granular layer circuit computations. These investigations have highlighted the critical role of Golgi cells in: generating dense clusters of granule cell activity organized in center-surround structures, implementing combinatorial operations on multiple mossy fiber inputs, regulating transmission gain, and cut-off frequency, controlling spike timing and burst transmission, and determining the sign, intensity and duration of long-term synaptic plasticity at the mossy fiber-granule cell relay.

Although specific LTP expression mechanisms could be critical to determine the dynamics of repetitive neurotransmission, this important issue remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we have performed whole cell patch-clamp recordings of mossy fiber-granule cell LTP in acute rat cerebellar slices and studied its computational implications with a mathematical model. During LTP, stimulation with short impulse trains at 100 Hz revealed earlier initiation of granule cell spike bursts and a smaller nonsignificant spike frequency increase. In voltage-clamp recordings, short AMPA excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) trains showed short-term facilitation and depression and a sustained component probably generated by spillover. During LTP, facilitation disappeared, depression accelerated, and the sustained current increased. The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) current also increased. In agreement with a presynaptic expression caused by increased release probability, similar changes were observed by raising extracellular [Ca(2+)]. A mathematical model of mossy fiber-granule cell neurotransmission showed that increasing release probability efficiently modulated the first-spike delay. Glutamate spillover, by causing tonic NMDA and AMPA receptor activation, accelerated excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) temporal summation and maintained a sustained spike discharge. The effect of increasing neurotransmitter release could not be replicated by increasing receptor conductance, which, like postsynaptic manipulations enhancing intrinsic excitability, proved very effective in raising granule cell output frequency. Independent regulation of spike burst initiation and frequency during LTP may provide mechanisms for temporal recoding and gain control of afferent signals at the input stage of cerebellar cortex.","Whole-cell recordings from GrCs were obtained with patch-clamp technique [20,29,#AUTHOR_TAG] by using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA, USA) (-3dB; cut-off frequency = 2 kHz).","['Whole-cell recordings from GrCs were obtained with patch-clamp technique [20,29,#AUTHOR_TAG] by using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA, USA) (-3dB; cut-off frequency = 2 kHz).', 'Recordings were digitized at 20 kHz using pClamp 9 (Molecular Devices) and a Digidata 1322A A/D converter (Molecular Devices).', 'Patch pipettes were made with a vertical puller (model PP-830, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) from borosilicate glass capillaries and filled with the following solution (in mM): 126 K-gluconate, 8 NaCl, 15 glucose, 5 HEPES, 1 MgSO 4 , 0.1 BAPTA-4K, 0.05 BAPTA-Ca 2+ , 3 ATP, 100 �_M GTP; pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH.', 'This solution maintained resting free-[Ca 2+ ] at 100 nM and pipettes had a resistance of 7-10 MO before seal formation.']",0,"['Whole-cell recordings from GrCs were obtained with patch-clamp technique [20,29,#AUTHOR_TAG] by using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA, USA) (-3dB; cut-off frequency = 2 kHz).']"

The main difficulty in its practical application to spike train analysis is that estimates of neuronal information from experimental data are prone to a systematic error (called ""bias""). This bias is an inevitable consequence of the limited number of stimulus-response samples that it is possible to record in a real experiment. In this paper, we first explain the origin and the implications of the bias problem in spike train analysis. We then review and evaluate some recent general-purpose methods to correct for sampling bias: the Panzeri-Treves, Quadratic Extrapolation, Best Universal Bound, Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek procedures, and a recently proposed shuffling bias reduction procedure. Finally, we make practical recommendations for the accurate computation of information from spike trains. Our main recommendation is to estimate information using the shuffling bias reduction procedure in combination with one of the other four general purpose bias reduction procedures mentioned in the preceding text. This provides information estimates with acceptable variance and which are unbiased even when the number of trials per stimulus is as small as the number of possible discrete neuronal responses.","MI descends directly from response entropy and noise entropy [13], which are correlated to the variability of responses to separate inputs [13] or to the same input [14][15]#AUTHOR_TAG, respectively.","['The language employed by neurons to communicate can be deciphered by using parameters taken from information and communication theory [8].', 'Among these parameters, mutual information (MI) was adapted to Neuroscience for quantifying the amount of information transmitted by single synapses [9], single neurons [10,11] or by large neuronal populations [12], therefore allowing the analysis of neural codes.', 'MI descends directly from response entropy and noise entropy [13], which are correlated to the variability of responses to separate inputs [13] or to the same input [14][15]#AUTHOR_TAG, respectively.', 'MI calculation provides a way to evaluate the capability of a neuronal system to separate different inputs and therefore to transmit information [17,18].']",0,"['MI descends directly from response entropy and noise entropy [13], which are correlated to the variability of responses to separate inputs [13] or to the same input [14][15]#AUTHOR_TAG, respectively.', 'MI calculation provides a way to evaluate the capability of a neuronal system to separate different inputs and therefore to transmit information [17,18].']"

Banks"", ""Robert A. Pearce""]","BACKGROUND Volatile agents alter inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) at clinically relevant concentrations, an action that is thought to make an important contribution to their behavioral effects. The authors investigated the mechanisms underlying these effects by evaluating the concentration dependence of modulation by enflurane, isoflurane, and halothane of IPSCs in rat hippocampal slices.   METHODS Action potential-independent gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) IPSCs (miniature IPSCs [mIPSCs]) were recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons. The effects on mIPSC amplitude were used to distinguish between presynaptic (altered release) and postsynaptic (altered receptor response) actions of volatile agents. The concentration dependence of blocking and prolonging actions was compared among the volatile agents to determine whether a single modulatory process could account for both effects.   RESULTS The application of volatile anesthetics prolonged the decay and reduced the amplitude of mIPSCs in a dose-dependent manner. The effects on decay time for isoflurane and enflurane could not be distinguished. However, the blocking effect of enflurane was significantly greater than that of isoflurane at all concentrations. Despite the blocking effect, the net action of these agents was enhanced inhibition, because charge transfer was always significantly greater than control. Isoflurane, and to a lesser extent enflurane and halothane, caused a picrotoxin-sensitive increase in baseline noise. Moderate increases in mIPSC frequency were also observed for all agents.   CONCLUSIONS These results show that enflurane, isoflurane, and halothane reduce IPSC amplitude through a direct postsynaptic action. Furthermore, the concentration dependence of the actions of the agents reveals a dissociation between the effects on the amplitude and the time course of IPSCs, suggesting that distinct mechanisms underlie the two actions.",Total charge transfer was calculated by measuring IPSCs area #AUTHOR_TAG.,"['Axon bundles of the inhibitory Golgi cell were stimulated by positioning bipolar tungsten electrode in the granular layer.', 'One or two stimuli at 50 Hz repeated at 0.1 Hz were used.', 'Inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) were detected in voltage-clamp configuration by holding neurons at 0 mV, and appeared as positive deflections given that chloride reversal potential was set at about -60 mV in our experimental conditions.', 'IPSCs were isolated by adding to the bath solution 10 �_M NBQX (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) and 25 �_M D-APV (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) to block glutamate AMPA and NMDA receptors, respectively.', 'NMDA currents were isolated by voltage clamping GrCs at -40 mV and in the presence of 10 �_M SR9519 (Gabazine; Tocris Bioscience, Bristol UK), a selective GABA-A receptor blocker, and 10 �_M NBQX.', 'Peak amplitude, time to peak, rise time from 10 to 90% of peak amplitude (rise 10-90 ) were computed.', 'Decay components of synaptic currents were evaluated by calculating time constant (��) of the mono-exponential fitting between the peak and the baseline.', 'Total charge transfer was calculated by measuring IPSCs area #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) between first and second IPSC (PPR = IPSC 2 /IPSC 1 ) was used to estimate potential differences in synaptic release probability [31].', 'At the end of some experiments IPSCs were blocked with 10 �_M Gabazine (n = 6; data not shown), to confirm the GABAergic nature of inhibitory currents.']",1,"['Total charge transfer was calculated by measuring IPSCs area #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) between first and second IPSC (PPR = IPSC 2 /IPSC 1 ) was used to estimate potential differences in synaptic release probability [31].', 'At the end of some experiments IPSCs were blocked with 10 _M Gabazine (n = 6; data not shown), to confirm the GABAergic nature of inhibitory currents.']"

The lower power consumption achieved through DSM was analyzed under an additional five SPR (strategic power reduction) scenarios to explore how the reduced electricity demand could be optimized through different modalities of thermoelectric power production that lower human health risks, thermal water pollution, carbon emissions or system costs (operation and maintenance) of power plants. SPR scenarios show potential to lower health risks to nearly two million people with corresponding avoided external costs of $11 billion per year, lower carbon emissions (31%, maximum) and thermal water pollution (37%, maximum). By internalizing external costs, some unfavorable investments (NPV (net present value) < 0) turned into favorable ones (NPV > 0).

CC1730,46113415,On the representation of demand-side management in power system models,Alexander Zerrahn,Demand side management: Benefits and challenges,"[""Goran Strbac""]","Environmental policies, reduced manufacturing costs, and technology improvements have all contributed to the growing installation of wind turbines and solar photovoltaic arrays in the electric grid. While these new sources of renewable electrical power provide environmental and economic benefits to the electric grid, they also complicate the balancing of supply and demand required to reliably operate the grid. The seasonal, daily, and sub-hourly fluctuations in the energy output of wind and solar generators must be compensated by operating the existing power plant fleet more flexibly or by providing more flexible sources of electricity demand. This dissertation categorizes and quantifies this compensation by studying the ""flexibility requirements'' imposed by wind and solar generation, approximates the economically optimal capacities of regional wind and solar resources in the grid, and explores the ability of a central utility plant to add a flexible source of demand to the electric grid system. These topics are covered in the four chapters described below. Chapter 3 utilizes a unit commitment and dispatch (UC&D) model to simulate large solar generation assets with different geographic locations and orientations. The simulations show the sensitivity of the wholesale energy price, reserve market prices, total dispatch cost, fuel mix, emissions, and water use to changes in net load flexibility requirements. The results show that generating 22,500 GWh of solar energy in a 2011 simulation of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) reduces total dispatch cost by approximately $900 Million (a 10.3% decrease) while increasing ancillary services costs by approximately $10 Million (a 3% increase). The results also show that solar PV reduces water consumption, water withdrawals, and CO2, NO [subscript x], and SO [subscript x] emissions. Installing sufficient solar panel capacity to generate that much electricity also reduces peak load by 4% but increases net load volatility by 40--79% and ramping by 11--33%. In addition, west-located, west-oriented solar resources reduce total dispatch cost more than the other simulated solar scenarios. The west-located, west-oriented solar simulation required greater system flexibility, but utilized more low-cost generators and fewer high-cost generators for energy production than other simulated scenarios. These results suggest that the mix of energy provided by different generation technologies influences the dispatch cost more than the net load flexibility requirements. Chapter 4 develops a quantitative framework for calculating flexibility requirements and performs a statistical analysis of load, wind, and solar data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to show how wind and solar capacity impacts these grid flexibility requirements. Growing wind capacity shows only minor correlation with increasing flexibility requirements, but shows some correlation with ramp down rates and daily volatility in the net load. Growing solar capacity shows a direct correlation with increasing flexibility requirements if load patterns do not change. While adding 15.7 GW of wind power had only minor effects on system flexibility requirements, adding 14.5 GW of solar to the ERCOT grid increases maximum 1-hr ramp rates by 135%, 3-hr ramp rates by 30%, ramp factors by 140%, 1-hr volatility by 100%, and 1-day volatility by 30%. Wind and solar impact flexibility requirements at different times of the day: wind tends to intensify demand-driven flexibility events by ramping up energy production at night when demand is decreasing and ramping down energy production in the morning when demand is increasing, while solar tends to intensify flexibility requirements due to its quick changes in energy output driven by the rising and setting sun. Adding wind to a system with large amounts of solar does not tend to increase flexibility requirements except for the daily volatility. The geographic location and orientation of solar arrays also influences flexibility requirements, with fixed, southeast-facing panels providing a significant reduction. These results can inform strategies for managing the grid flexibility requirements created by growing renewable capacity. Chapter 5 develops a model for calculating the optimal amount of transmission, wind, and solar capacity that should be built in a grid's different regions. It also presents a framework for choosing CO2 prices by balancing increasing system cost and flexibility requirements with CO2 emissions reductions. In a simulation of the ERCOT grid, the model suggests a 60 $/ton CO2 price and an optimal investment of 27.0 GW of transmission capacity to five different regions. These regions install a total of 26.6 GW of wind and 11.1 GW of solar, representing a grid with about 60% thermal and 40% renewable capacity. This renewable mix produces 110 TWh of energy per year, 34% of the total electricity demand. The grid emits 82.2 million tons of CO2 per year under this scenario, a 65% reduction from the 237 million tons produced when no renewable capacity is installed. At the optimal renewable development solution, all coal and natural gas boiler generators have capacity factors less than 20% with many of them not being dispatched at all. While these results are specific to ERCOT, the methods and model can be used by any grid considering renewable energy capacity expansion. Chapter 6 develops a mixed-integer linear program for modeling the optimal equipment capacity and dispatch of a central utility plant (CUP) in a residential neighborhood and its ability to improve rooftop solar integration. The CUP equipment includes a microturbine, battery, chiller plant, and cooling storage. The CUP model is exposed to a variety of electricity rate structures to see how they influence its operation. The model finds the optimal capacity for each piece of CUP equipment, optimizing their hourly dispatch to meet neighborhood cooling and electric demand while maximizing profit. In an Austin, TX, USA base case, the neighborhood benefits economically by including the CUP, although the CUP demonstrates limited potential to integrate high penetrations of rooftop solar resources. While peak demand and reverse power flows are reduced under all tested rate structures, the CUP worsens net demand ramp rates. A time-of-use rate with no demand charge and moderate differences between off-peak and on-peak prices balances the output parameters, reducing reverse power flows by 43%, peak demand by 51%, and annual cost by 9.1% versus the ``No CUP'' base case while limiting net demand ramp rate increase to 84% more than the base case. Building a clean, resilient, and reliable electric grid for the future is a worthwhile endeavor that will require innovative supply-side and demand-side solutions for integrating the intermittent power output of renewable generation into the electric grid. As a cohesive document, this dissertation communicates the scale and severity of the flexibility requirements that will be required to operate systems with large amounts of wind and solar generation and explores one demand-side method for providing that needed flexibility. There are many opportunities to expand these analyses and explore new sources of grid flexibility in future work.Mechanical Engineerin",DSM may help to increase power system efficiency by reducing peak generation capacity requirements and by improving the utilization of both generation and network assets (#AUTHOR_TAG 2008).,"['The application of demand-side management (DSM) in power systems recently gains increasing attention in many countries.', 'DSM may help to increase power system efficiency by reducing peak generation capacity requirements and by improving the utilization of both generation and network assets (#AUTHOR_TAG 2008).', 'DSM can further provide a means of accommodating growing power generation from fluctuating renewable sources (Aghaei and Alizadeh 2013) and may also help to address carbon emissions constraints (Bergaentzlͩ et al. 2014).', 'Moreover, the demand side is viewed as a potentially relevant source for the provision of reserves.', 'For example, Falsafi et al.

Here we show through a series of studies in human cohorts and human-derived hepatocytes that a common noncoding polymorphism at the 1p13 locus, rs12740374, creates a C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein) transcription factor binding site and alters the hepatic expression of the SORT1 gene. With small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown and viral overexpression in mouse liver, we demonstrate that Sort1 alters plasma LDL-C and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle levels by modulating hepatic VLDL secretion. Thus, we provide functional evidence for a novel regulatory pathway for lipoprotein metabolism and suggest that modulation of this pathway may alter risk for MI in humans.

Understanding quantitatively how regulatory systems convert input signals to appropriate outputs remains a challenge. For the first time, we successfully model even skipped (eve) stripes 2 and 3+7 across the entire fly embryo at cellular resolution. A straightforward statistical relationship explains how transcription factor (TF) concentrations define eve's complex spatial expression, without the need for pairwise interactions or cross-regulatory dynamics. Simulating thousands of TF combinations, we recover known regulators and suggest new candidates. Finally, we accurately predict the intricate effects of perturbations including TF mutations and misexpression. Our approach imposes minimal assumptions about regulatory function; instead we infer underlying mechanisms from models that best fit the data, like the lack of TF-specific thresholds and the positional value of homotypic interactions.

The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of different organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. Several pathogenic processes are involved in the development of diabetes. These range from autoimmune destruction of the beta-cells of the pancreas with consequent insulin deficiency to abnormalities that result in resistance to insulin action (American Diabetes Association, 2011). The vast majority of cases of diabetes fall into two broad categories. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), the cause is an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion, whereas in type 2 diabetes (T2D), the cause is a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. However, the subdivision into two main categories represents a simplification of the real situation, and research during the recent years has shown that the disease is much more heterogeneous than a simple subdivision into two major subtypes assumes. Worldwide prevalence figures estimate that there are 280 million diabetic patients in 2011 and more than 500 million in 2030 (http://www.diabetesatlas.org/). In Europe, about 6-8% of the population suffer from diabetes, of them about 90% has T2D and 10% T1D, thereby making T2D to the fastest increasing disease in Europe and worldwide. This epidemic has been ascribed to a collision between the genes and the environment. While our knowledge about the genes is clearly better for T1D than for T2D given the strong contribution of variation in the HLA region to the risk of T1D, the opposite is the case for T2D, where our knowledge about the environmental triggers (obesity, lack of exercise) is much better than the understanding of the underlying genetic causes. This lack of knowledge about the underlying genetic causes of diabetes is often referred to as missing heritability (Manolio et al., 2009) which exceeds 80% for T2D but less than 25% for T1D. In the following review, we will discuss potential sources of this missing heritability which also includes the possibility that our definition of diabetes and its subgroups is imprecise and thereby making the identification of genetic causes difficult.","This approach has been highly profitable in Crohn's disease-a common inflammatory disorder whose root causes remained cryptic until genome-wide association studies identified a large number of loci with fundamental defects in mucosal immunity (Graham and Xavier, 2013)-but not in type 2 diabetes, where the pathophysiology awaits clarification (#AUTHOR_TAG and Pociot, 2013).","[""One approach may be to use a set of model traits and diseases and employ their existing mapped loci to identify a small set of the component genes by brute-force (or, luck) and use the uncovered biology to infer which other genes in their ''pathways'' can explain the dis-ease."", ""This approach has been highly profitable in Crohn's disease-a common inflammatory disorder whose root causes remained cryptic until genome-wide association studies identified a large number of loci with fundamental defects in mucosal immunity (Graham and Xavier, 2013)-but not in type 2 diabetes, where the pathophysiology awaits clarification (#AUTHOR_TAG and Pociot, 2013)."", 'Although we suspect that the numbers of pathways involved are fewer than the numbers of genes involved, this is merely suspicion.', 'Nevertheless, can we reduce the complexity of the problem by identifying all of the relevant pathways?', 'Despite uncertainty, this approach has the advantage of leading to specific testable hypotheses.', 'The second approach is to focus research on why the disease is complex in the first place.', 'Although the genome is linear, its expression and biology are highly nonlinear and hierarchical, being sequestered in specific cells and organelles (Ilsley et al., 2013).', 'Understanding this hierarchy, the province of systems biology, is critical to the solution of the complex inheritance problem (Yosef et al., 2013).', 'Even more importantly, this approach might, through the effect of mutations, allow us to decipher cell circuitry and understand which pathways are limiting and which are redundant.', 'This last aspect is critical: as we argue below, with our current state of knowledge, we are likely to have our greatest success with understanding how genes map onto pathways, and how pathways map onto disease, before a true quantitative understanding of disease biology emerges.', 'One might counter that existing gene ontologies do precisely that, but, even in yeast, this appears to be highly incomplete (Dutkowski et al., 2013).']",0,"[""This approach has been highly profitable in Crohn's disease-a common inflammatory disorder whose root causes remained cryptic until genome-wide association studies identified a large number of loci with fundamental defects in mucosal immunity (Graham and Xavier, 2013)-but not in type 2 diabetes, where the pathophysiology awaits clarification (#AUTHOR_TAG and Pociot, 2013).""]"

In a study of 690 European- and 192 Chinese-descent probands and their parents or controls, we demonstrate the ubiquity of a >4-fold susceptibility from a C-->T allele (rs2435357: p = 3.9 x 10(-43) in European ancestry; p = 1.1 x 10(-21) in Chinese samples) that probably arose once within the intronic RET enhancer MCS+9.7. With in vitro assays, we now show that the T variant disrupts a SOX10 binding site within MCS+9.7 that compromises RET transactivation. The T allele, with a control frequency of 20%-30%/47% and case frequency of 54%-62%/88% in European/Chinese-ancestry individuals, is involved in all forms of HSCR. It is marginally associated with proband gender (p = 0.13) and significantly so with length of aganglionosis (p = 7.6 x 10(-5)) and familiality (p = 6.2 x 10(-4)). The enhancer variant is more frequent in the common forms of male, short-segment, and simplex families whereas multiple, rare, coding mutations are the norm in the less common and more severe forms of female, long-segment, and multiplex families. The T variant also increases penetrance in patients with rare RET coding mutations. Thus, both rare and common mutations, individually and together, make contributions to the risk of HSCR. The distribution of RET variants in diverse HSCR patients suggests a ""cellular-recessive"" genetic model where both RET alleles' function is compromised. The RET allelic series, and its genotype-phenotype correlations, shows that success in variant identification in complex disorders may strongly depend on which patients are studied.Copyright  2010 The American Society of Human Genetics.

Recent data from mouse models of Marfan's syndrome suggest that aortic-root enlargement is caused by excessive signaling by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) that can be mitigated by treatment with TGF-beta antagonists, including angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARBs). We evaluated the clinical response to ARBs in pediatric patients with Marfan's syndrome who had severe aortic-root enlargement. Methods: We identified 18 pediatric patients with Marfan's syndrome who had been followed during 12 to 47 months of therapy with ARBs after other medical therapy had failed to prevent progressive aortic-root enlargement. The ARB was losartan in 17 patients and irbesartan in 1 patient. We evaluated the efficacy of ARB therapy by comparing the rates of change in aortic-root diameter before and after the initiation of treatment with ARBs. Results: The mean (+/-SD) rate of change in aortic-root diameter decreased significantly from 3.54+/-2.87 mm per year during previous medical therapy to 0.46+/-0.62 mm per year during ARB therapy (P<0.001). The deviation of aortic-root enlargement from normal, as expressed by the rate of change in z scores, was reduced by a mean difference of 1.47 z scores per year (95% confidence interval, 0.70 to 2.24; P<0.001) after the initiation of ARB therapy. The sinotubular junction, which is prone to dilation in Marfan's syndrome as well, also showed a reduced rate of change in diameter during ARB therapy (P<0.05), whereas the distal ascending aorta, which does not normally become dilated in Marfan's syndrome, was not affected by ARB therapy. Conclusions: In a small cohort study, the use of ARB therapy in patients with Marfan's syndrome significantly slowed the rate of progressive aortic-root dilation. These findings require confirmation in a randomized trial.","As the case for Marfan syndrome demonstrates, the identification of fibrillin 1 mutations was insufficient to identify therapies without the concomitant understanding of the pathophysiology (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008).","['It is clear that the majority of complex diseases do not harbor this level of proof today; neither do most monogenic disorders.', 'As the case for Marfan syndrome demonstrates, the identification of fibrillin 1 mutations was insufficient to identify therapies without the concomitant understanding of the pathophysiology (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008).', 'Animal models are attractive because of the ability to do experimental manipulations that test predictions of gene function, but these experiments test the function of a gene in a context that is decidedly different from that with a human patient.', 'However imperfect animal models are, progress in the direction of understanding causality has been very beneficial when gene disruptions alone, perhaps at more than one gene, have taught us fundamental lessons in pathophysiology (Farago et al., 2012).', 'In many cases, investigators have also demonstrated that disease results only when combined with a potent environmental insult.', 'When known, such as the effect of dietary cholesterol vis-�_ -vis genes involved in cholesterol metabolism in atherosclerosis, such environmental exposures to gene-deficient mouse models have provided a tight circle of proof (Plump et al., 1992).', 'A recent example of gestational hypoxia modulating the effect of Notch signaling and leading to scoliosis in mice and in human families shows how environmental factors beyond diet can be examined even for congenital disorders (Sparrow et al., 2012).', ""Despite these successes, pursuit of Koch's postulates faces other challenges."", 'For example, mutations in the same gene might not reveal an identical phenotype in humans and in an animal model even if molecular pathways are conserved.', 'This is a particular problem for behavioral phenotypes where brain circuitry may have evolved quite differently in humans and other mammals, challenging our ability to model behavior accurately.', 'Nevertheless, such an analysis might reveal an underlying neural phenotype or a molecular or cellular correlate that is in common and subject to testing of the postulates.']",0,"['As the case for Marfan syndrome demonstrates, the identification of fibrillin 1 mutations was insufficient to identify therapies without the concomitant understanding of the pathophysiology (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008).']"

This book, which includes an appendix on the use of the Fredholm theory for Riemann-Hilbert problems in the Hšlder class, is intended for researchers and graduate students of applied mathematics and analysis, especially those with an interest in integrable systems, nonlinear waves, or complex analysis.","Properties of various classes of solutions to this equation have been extensively studied both analytically and numerically (Bronski and Kutz 2002;Buckingham and Venakides 2007;Carles 2007;Ceniceros and Tian 2002;Forest and Lee 1986;Grenier 1998;Kamvissis 1996;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2003;Klein 2006;Lyng and Miller 2007;Miller and Kamvissis 1998;Tovbis et al. 2004Tovbis et al. , 2006.","['(here �� * stands for the complex conjugate function).', 'Properties of various classes of solutions to this equation have been extensively studied both analytically and numerically (Bronski and Kutz 2002;Buckingham and Venakides 2007;Carles 2007;Ceniceros and Tian 2002;Forest and Lee 1986;Grenier 1998;Kamvissis 1996;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2003;Klein 2006;Lyng and Miller 2007;Miller and Kamvissis 1998;Tovbis et al. 2004Tovbis et al. , 2006.', 'One of the striking features that distinguishes this equation from, say, the defocusing case']",0,"['Properties of various classes of solutions to this equation have been extensively studied both analytically and numerically (Bronski and Kutz 2002;Buckingham and Venakides 2007;Carles 2007;Ceniceros and Tian 2002;Forest and Lee 1986;Grenier 1998;Kamvissis 1996;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2003;Klein 2006;Lyng and Miller 2007;Miller and Kamvissis 1998;Tovbis et al. 2004Tovbis et al. , 2006.']"

The Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, first published in 1965, is an enormously popular direct search method for multidimensional unconstrained minimization. Despite its widespread use, essentially no theoretical results have been proved explicitly for the Nelder-Mead algorithm. This paper presents convergence properties of the Nelder-Mead algorithm applied to strictly convex functions in dimensions 1 and 2. We prove convergence to a minimizer for dimension 1, and various limited convergence results for dimension 2. A counterexample of McKinnon gives a family of strictly convex functions in two dimensions and a set of initial conditions for which the Nelder-Mead algorithm converges to a nonminimizer. It is not yet known whether the Nelder-Mead method can be proved to converge to a minimizer for a more specialized class of convex functions in two dimensions.

We provide an exact analytic description of decelerating, stopping and re-accelerating of slow-light solitons in atomic media in the nonadiabatic regime. Dynamical control over slow-light solitons is realized via a controlling field generated by an auxiliary laser. For a rather general time dependence of the field; we find the dynamics of the slow-light soliton inside the medium.

The book deals with classical solutions of global problems for hyperbolic equations or systems. The approach is based on the display and study of two local blowup mechanisms, which the author calls the ""ordinary differential equation mechanism"" and the ""geometric blowup mechanism"". It introduces, via energy methods, the concept of lifespan, related to the nonlinear propagation of regularity (from the past to the future). It addresses specifically the question of whether or not there will be blowup in a solution, and it classifies those methods used to give positive answers to the question.

C. Cross"", ""P. C. Hohenberg""]","A comprehensive review of spatiotemporal pattern formation in systems driven away from equilibrium is presented, with emphasis on comparisons between theory and quantitative experiments. Examples include patterns in hydrodynamic systems such as thermal convection in pure fluids and binary mixtures, Taylor-Couette flow, parametric-wave instabilities, as well as patterns in solidification fronts, nonlinear optics, oscillatory chemical reactions and excitable biological media. The theoretical starting point is usually a set of deterministic equations of motion, typically in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations. These are sometimes supplemented by stochastic terms representing thermal or instrumental noise, but for macroscopic systems and carefully designed experiments the stochastic forces are often negligible. An aim of theory is to describe solutions of the deterministic equations that are likely to be reached starting from typical initial conditions and to persist at long times. A unified description is developed, based on the linear instabilities of a homogeneous state, which leads naturally to a classification of patterns in terms of the characteristic wave vector q0 and frequency o0 of the instability. Type Is systems (o0=0, q00) are stationary in time and periodic in space; type IIIo systems (o00, q0=0) are periodic in time and uniform in space; and type Io systems (o00, q00) are periodic in both space and time. Near a continuous (or supercritical) instability, the dynamics may be accurately described via ""amplitude equations,"" whose form is universal for each type of instability. The specifics of each system enter only through the nonuniversal coefficients. Far from the instability threshold a different universal description known as the ""phase equation"" may be derived, but it is restricted to slow distortions of an ideal pattern. For many systems appropriate starting equations are either not known or too complicated to analyze conveniently. It is thus useful to introduce phenomenological order-parameter models, which lead to the correct amplitude equations near threshold, and which may be solved analytically or numerically in the nonlinear regime away from the instability. The above theoretical methods are useful in analyzing ""real pattern effects"" such as the influence of external boundaries, or the formation and dynamics of defects in ideal structures. An important element in nonequilibrium systems is the appearance of deterministic chaos. A greal deal is known about systems with a small number of degrees of freedom displaying ""temporal chaos,"" where the structure of the phase space can be analyzed in detail. For spatially extended systems with many degrees of freedom, on the other hand, one is dealing with spatiotemporal chaos and appropriate methods of analysis need to be developed. In addition to the general features of nonequilibrium pattern formation discussed above, detailed reviews of theoretical and experimental work on many specific systems are presented. These include Rayleigh-Benard convection in a pure fluid, convection in binary-fluid mixtures, electrohydrodynamic convection in nematic liquid crystals, Taylor-Couette flow between rotating cylinders, parametric surface waves, patterns in certain open flow systems, oscillatory chemical reactions, static and dynamic patterns in biological media, crystallization fronts, and patterns in nonlinear optics.

We show that exemplar models can be used to perform a sophisticated form of Monte Carlo approximation known as importance sampling and thus provide a way to perform approximate Bayesian inference. Simulations of Bayesian inference in speech perception, generalization along a single dimension, making predictions about everyday events, concept learning, and reconstruction from memory show that exemplar models can often account for human performance with only a few exemplars, for both simple and relatively complex prior distributions.

This differs from more traditional formal models of cognition, which focus on the psychological processes responsible for behavior. A basic challenge for rational models is thus explaining how optimal solutions can be approximated by psychological processes. We outline a general strategy for answering this question, namely to explore the psychological plausibility of approximation algorithms developed in computer science and statistics. In particular, we argue that Monte Carlo methods provide a source of rational process models that connect optimal solutions to psychological processes. We support this argument through a detailed example, applying this approach to Anderson's (1990, 1991) rational model of categorization (RMC), which involves a particularly challenging computational problem. Drawing on a connection between the RMC and ideas from nonparametric Bayesian statistics, we propose 2 alternative algorithms for approximate inference in this model. The algorithms we consider include Gibbs sampling, a procedure appropriate when all stimuli are presented simultaneously, and particle filters, which sequentially approximate the posterior distribution with a small number of samples that are updated as new data become available.

The borderline between rationality and irrationality is fundamental to many aspects of human life including the law, mental health, and language interpretation. But what is it to be rational? One answer, deeply embedded in the Western intellectual tradition since ancient Greece, is that rationality concerns reasoning according to the rules of logic - the formal theory that specifies the inferential connections that hold with certainty between propositions. Piaget viewed logical reasoning as defining the end-point of cognitive development; and contemporary psychology of reasoning has focussed on comparing human reasoning against logical standards. Bayesian Rationality argues that rationality is defined instead by the ability to reason about uncertainty. Although people are typically poor at numerical reasoning about probability, human thought is sensitive to subtle patterns of qualitative Bayesian, probabilistic reasoning. In Chapters 1-4 of Bayesian Rationality (Oaksford & Chater 2007), the case is made that cognition in general, and human everyday reasoning in particular, is best viewed as solving probabilistic, rather than logical, inference problems. In Chapters 5-7 the psychology of ""deductive"" reasoning is tackled head-on: It is argued that purportedly ""logical"" reasoning problems, revealing apparently irrational behaviour, are better understood from a probabilistic point of view. Data from conditional reasoning, Wason's selection task, and syllogistic inference are captured by recasting these problems probabilistically.

Wilson""]","Classical and Connectionist theories of cognitive architecture seek to explain systematicity (i.e., the property of human cognition whereby cognitive capacity comes in groups of related behaviours) as a consequence of syntactically and functionally compositional representations, respectively. However, both theories depend on ad hoc assumptions to exclude specific instances of these forms of compositionality (e.g. grammars, networks) that do not account for systematicity. By analogy with the Ptolemaic (i.e. geocentric) theory of planetary motion, although either theory can be made to be consistent with the data, both nonetheless fail to fully explain it. Category theory, a branch of mathematics, provides an alternative explanation based on the formal concept of adjunction, which relates a pair of structure-preserving maps, called functors.

Human behavior is consistent with the optimal statistical solution to this problem in many tasks, including cue combination and orientation detection. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying this behavior is of particular importance, since probabilistic computations are notoriously challenging. Here we propose a simple mechanism for Bayesian inference which involves averaging over a few feature detection neurons which fire at a rate determined by their similarity to a sensory stimulus. This mechanism is based on a Monte Carlo method known as importance sampling, commonly used in computer science and statistics. Moreover, a simple extension to recursive importance sampling can be used to perform hierarchical Bayesian inference.

Substantial belief biases were observed despite controls for possible conversions of the premises. Equally substantial effects of logic were observed despite controls for two possible response biases. A consistent interaction between belief and logic was also recorded; belief bias was more marked on invalid than on valid syllogisms. In all experiments, verbal protocols were recorded and analyzed. These protocols are interpreted in some cases as providing rationalizations for prejudiced decisions and, in other cases, as reflecting a genuine process of premise to conclusion reasoning. In the latter cases, belief bias was minimal but still present. Similarly, even subjects who focus primarily on the conclusion are influenced to an extent by the logic. Thus a conflict between logic and belief is observed throughout, but at several levels of extent.","Those theories draw on the same distinctions discussed by Goel (see, e.g.,#AUTHOR_TAG, Barston, & Pollard, 1983).","['Consider the case of propositional reasoning.', 'The neurophysiological/implementation level appears to be the wrong level to begin an analysis of a complex ability such as this.', 'It is unclear where one would start.', 'Simply scanning subjects while they attempt reasoning tasks (with no cognitive-level theory of how such tasks are solved) is unlikely to yield informative results.', 'In fact, there are many neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies of reasoning (see Shallice & Cooper, 2011, pp. 464-478 for a review).', 'The na__� ѱve observer might expect that these would have informed cognitive-scientific understanding of the ability.', 'Yet the studies present a confused picture, with a complex network of frontal and parietal cortical regions implicated across a range of reasoning tasks, and, while clearly defined reasoning deficits arise in some neuropsychological patients, one cannot easily infer a theory of reasoning from the neural data.', 'Indeed, the neural data have low discriminative power, with ongoing debates suggesting that the data are not even able to differentiate convincingly between existing cognitive-level theories (cf.', 'Coltheart, 2006Coltheart, , 2011.', 'Perhaps just as critically, Goel (2007) argues that interpretation of the neural data from reasoning experiments requires a re-evaluation of psychological theories of reasoning, with the neuroscience evidence indicating that human reasoning involves separate systems for dealing with (a) familiar and unfamiliar material, (b) conflicting information and belief bias, and (c) certain and uncertain information.', 'The evidence from functional neuroimaging to support these dissociations is far from conclusive, and, as Shallice and Cooper (2011) point out, dual-system theories of reasoning were proposed long before neuroimaging evidence was available.', 'Those theories draw on the same distinctions discussed by Goel (see, e.g.,#AUTHOR_TAG, Barston, & Pollard, 1983).', 'So in this domain at least neuroscience evidence does not allow one to ""explain"" reasoning behavior, nor does it trigger the complete re-evaluation of cognitive theory that Goel (2007) suggests.']",0,"['Consider the case of propositional reasoning.', 'Those theories draw on the same distinctions discussed by Goel (see, e.g.,#AUTHOR_TAG, Barston, & Pollard, 1983).', 'So in this domain at least neuroscience evidence does not allow one to ""explain"" reasoning behavior, nor does it trigger the complete re-evaluation of cognitive theory that Goel (2007) suggests.']"

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat&apos;s visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel &amp; Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy.

One strategy for bridging levels of analysis is to explore cognitive processes that have a direct link to probabilistic inference.

The new approach narrows the space of predicted behaviors through analysis of the payoff achieved by alternative strategies, rather than through fitting strategies and theoretical parameters to data. It extends and complements established approaches, including computational cognitive architectures, rational analysis, optimal motor control, bounded rationality, and signal detection theory. The authors illustrate the approach with a reanalysis of an existing account of psychological refractory period (PRP) dual-task performance and the development and analysis of a new theory of ordered dual-task responses. These analyses yield several novel results, including a new understanding of the role of strategic variation in existing accounts of PRP and the first predictive, quantitative account showing how the details of ordered dual-task phenomena emerge from the rational control of a cognitive system subject to the combined constraints of internal variance, motor interference, and a response selection bottleneck.","One move in this direction is the ""computational rationality"" approach (#AUTHOR_TAG, Lewis, & Vera, 2009;Lewis, Howes, & Singh, 2014), which applies Russell and Subramanian's (1995) notion of bounded optimality for artificial intelligence agents to the analysis of human behavior.","['One move in this direction is the ""computational rationality"" approach (#AUTHOR_TAG, Lewis, & Vera, 2009;Lewis, Howes, & Singh, 2014), which applies Russell and Subramanian\'s (1995) notion of bounded optimality for artificial intelligence agents to the analysis of human behavior.', 'The underlying assumption of this approach is that human behavior is generated by cognitive processes that are adapted not only to the structure of the environment but also to the (bounded) cognitive architecture, and it is this latter feature which determines suboptimal human performance compared to an optimal Bayesian CL solution.', 'Computational rationality differs significantly therefore from the rational process models approach in requiring not only the specification of a task environment but also a cognitive architecture and a set of programs to execute behaviors to be specified at the ARL.']",4,"['One move in this direction is the ""computational rationality"" approach (#AUTHOR_TAG, Lewis, & Vera, 2009;Lewis, Howes, & Singh, 2014), which applies Russell and Subramanian\'s (1995) notion of bounded optimality for artificial intelligence agents to the analysis of human behavior.', 'The underlying assumption of this approach is that human behavior is generated by cognitive processes that are adapted not only to the structure of the environment but also to the (bounded) cognitive architecture, and it is this latter feature which determines suboptimal human performance compared to an optimal Bayesian CL solution.', 'Computational rationality differs significantly therefore from the rational process models approach in requiring not only the specification of a task environment but also a cognitive architecture and a set of programs to execute behaviors to be specified at the ARL.']"

Cognitive dissonance theory states that after making a difficult choice between two equally preferred items, the act of rejecting a favorite item induces an uncomfortable feeling (cognitive dissonance), which in turn motivates individuals to change their preferences to match their prior decision (i.e., reducing preference for rejected items). Recently, however, Chen and Risen [Chen K, Risen J (2010) J Pers Soc Psychol 99:573-594] pointed out a serious methodological problem, which casts a doubt on the very existence of this choice-induced preference change as studied over the past 50 y. Here, using a proper control condition and two measures of preferences (self-report and brain activity), we found that the mere act of making a choice can change self-report preference as well as its neural representation (i.e., striatum activity), thus providing strong evidence for choice-induced preference change. Furthermore, our data indicate that the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tracked the degree of cognitive dissonance on a trial-by-trial basis. Our findings provide important insights into the neural basis of how actions can alter an individual's preferences.","However, despite this flaw in the literature recent studies replicated choice-induced preference change with experimental designs that account for this artefact [9]#AUTHOR_TAG[11][12][13].","['The observation that choices express, but also shape our preferences is a consistent finding [5].', 'One paradigm demonstrating how choice affects preferences is the free-choice paradigm wherein value judgements are gathered on options before and after subjects are forced to choose one and reject the other option [6,7].', 'Post choice the chosen option is valued higher than the unchosen option, a spread seen for hard choices (options the subject initially valued similarly) but not easy choices (options which the subject initially valued differently).', 'A classical explanation of this finding is that it reflects a reduction of cognitive dissonance [8] where attitudes are changed to evaluate the current reality more positively.', 'A recent study has highlighted a methodological flaw in the way many studies on choice-induced preference change have been conducted [6].', 'As all valuations contain noise, chosen items are less likely to decrease in a second valuation because the choice accesses the same true underlying value.', 'This is strikingly revealed by a control condition in which a choice is made after the second evaluation, ruling out any causal influence of the choice on the change in valuation (see Izuma & Murayama [7] for review).', 'However, despite this flaw in the literature recent studies replicated choice-induced preference change with experimental designs that account for this artefact [9]#AUTHOR_TAG[11][12][13].']",0,"['The observation that choices express, but also shape our preferences is a consistent finding [5].', 'One paradigm demonstrating how choice affects preferences is the free-choice paradigm wherein value judgements are gathered on options before and after subjects are forced to choose one and reject the other option [6,7].', 'Post choice the chosen option is valued higher than the unchosen option, a spread seen for hard choices (options the subject initially valued similarly) but not easy choices (options which the subject initially valued differently).', 'A classical explanation of this finding is that it reflects a reduction of cognitive dissonance [8] where attitudes are changed to evaluate the current reality more positively.', 'A recent study has highlighted a methodological flaw in the way many studies on choice-induced preference change have been conducted [6].', 'However, despite this flaw in the literature recent studies replicated choice-induced preference change with experimental designs that account for this artefact [9]#AUTHOR_TAG[11][12][13].']"

Keith Chen"", ""Jane L. Risen""]","After making a choice between two objects, people evaluate their chosen item higher and their rejected item lower (i.e., they ""spread "" the alternatives). Since Brehm's (1956) initial free-choice experiment, psychologists have interpreted the spreading of alternatives as evidence for choice-induced attitude change. It is widely assumed to occur because choosing creates cognitive dissonance, which is then reduced through rationalization. In this paper, we express concern with this interpretation, noting that the free-choice paradigm (FCP) will produce spreading, even if people's attitudes remain unchanged. Specifically, if people's ratings/rankings are an imperfect measure of their preferences, and their choices are at least partially guided by their preferences, then the FCP will measure spreading, even if people's preferences remain perfectly stable. We show this, first, by proving a mathematical theorem that identifies a set of conditions under which the FCP will measure spreading, even absent attitude change. We then experimentally demonstrate that these conditions appear to hold, and that the FCP measures a spread of alternatives, even when this spreading cannot have been caused by choice. We discuss how the problem we identify applies to the basic FCP paradigm as well as to all variants that examine moderators and mediators of spreading. The results suggest a reassessment of the free-choice paradigm, and perhaps, the conclusions that have been drawn from it","One paradigm demonstrating how choice affects preferences is the free-choice paradigm wherein value judgements are gathered on options before and after subjects are forced to choose one and reject the other option [#AUTHOR_TAG,7].","['The observation that choices express, but also shape our preferences is a consistent finding [5].', 'One paradigm demonstrating how choice affects preferences is the free-choice paradigm wherein value judgements are gathered on options before and after subjects are forced to choose one and reject the other option [#AUTHOR_TAG,7].', 'Post choice the chosen option is valued higher than the unchosen option, a spread seen for hard choices (options the subject initially valued similarly) but not easy choices (options which the subject initially valued differently).', 'A classical explanation of this finding is that it reflects a reduction of cognitive dissonance [8] where attitudes are changed to evaluate the current reality more positively.', 'A recent study has highlighted a methodological flaw in the way many studies on choice-induced preference change have been conducted [6].', 'As all valuations contain noise, chosen items are less likely to decrease in a second valuation because the choice accesses the same true underlying value.', 'This is strikingly revealed by a control condition in which a choice is made after the second evaluation, ruling out any causal influence of the choice on the change in valuation (see Izuma & Murayama [7] for review).', 'However, despite this flaw in the literature recent studies replicated choice-induced preference change with experimental designs that account for this artefact [9][10][11][12][13].']",0,"['The observation that choices express, but also shape our preferences is a consistent finding [5].', 'One paradigm demonstrating how choice affects preferences is the free-choice paradigm wherein value judgements are gathered on options before and after subjects are forced to choose one and reject the other option [#AUTHOR_TAG,7].']"

The phenomenon of choice-induced preference change has been of interest to cognitive dissonance researchers in social psychology, and more recently, it has attracted the attention of researchers in economics and neuroscience. Preference modulation after the mere act of making a choice has been repeatedly demonstrated over the last 50 years by an experimental paradigm called the ""free-choice paradigm."" However, Chen and Risen (2010) pointed out a serious methodological flaw in this paradigm, arguing that evidence for choice-induced preference change is still insufficient. Despite the flaw, studies using the traditional free-choice paradigm continue to be published without addressing the criticism. Here, aiming to draw more attention to this issue, we briefly explain the methodological problem, and then describe simple simulation studies that illustrate how the free-choice paradigm produces a systematic pattern of preference change consistent with cognitive dissonance, even without any change in true preference. Our stimulation also shows how a different level of noise in each phase of the free-choice paradigm independently contributes to the magnitude of artificial preference change. Furthermore, we review ways of addressing the critique and provide a meta-analysis to show the effect size of choice-induced preference change after addressing the critique. Finally, we review and discuss, based on the results of the stimulation studies, how the criticism affects our interpretation of past findings generated from the free-choice paradigm. We conclude that the use of the conventional free-choice paradigm should be avoided in future research and the validity of past findings from studies using this paradigm should be empirically re-established.","One paradigm demonstrating how choice affects preferences is the free-choice paradigm wherein value judgements are gathered on options before and after subjects are forced to choose one and reject the other option [6,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['The observation that choices express, but also shape our preferences is a consistent finding [5].', 'One paradigm demonstrating how choice affects preferences is the free-choice paradigm wherein value judgements are gathered on options before and after subjects are forced to choose one and reject the other option [6,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'Post choice the chosen option is valued higher than the unchosen option, a spread seen for hard choices (options the subject initially valued similarly) but not easy choices (options which the subject initially valued differently).', 'A classical explanation of this finding is that it reflects a reduction of cognitive dissonance [8] where attitudes are changed to evaluate the current reality more positively.', 'A recent study has highlighted a methodological flaw in the way many studies on choice-induced preference change have been conducted [6].', 'As all valuations contain noise, chosen items are less likely to decrease in a second valuation because the choice accesses the same true underlying value.', 'This is strikingly revealed by a control condition in which a choice is made after the second evaluation, ruling out any causal influence of the choice on the change in valuation (see Izuma & Murayama [7] for review).', 'However, despite this flaw in the literature recent studies replicated choice-induced preference change with experimental designs that account for this artefact [9][10][11][12][13].']",0,"['One paradigm demonstrating how choice affects preferences is the free-choice paradigm wherein value judgements are gathered on options before and after subjects are forced to choose one and reject the other option [6,#AUTHOR_TAG].']"

But do these preference reversals also carry over to future choices and ratings? To investigate this question, we gave participants the task of choosing which of a pair of faces they found most attractive. Unknown to them, we sometimes used a card trick to exchange one face for the other. Both decision theory and common sense strongly suggest that most people would easily notice such a radical change in the outcome of a choice. But that was not the case: no more than a third of the exchanges were detected by the participants. We also included a second round of choices using the same face pairs, and two stages of post-choice attractiveness ratings of the faces. This way we were able to measure preference strength both as choice consistency and by looking at measures of rating differences between chosen and rejected options. We found that the initially rejected faces were chosen more frequently in the second choice, and the perceived attractiveness of these faces was increased even in uncoupled individual ratings at the end of the experiment.

However, the separate pathways in the striatum for go and no-go appear to violate this independence, instead coupling affect and effect. Respect for this interdependence has biased many studies of reward and punishment, so potential action-outcome valence interactions during anticipatory phases remain unexplored. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study with healthy human volunteers, we manipulated subjects' requirement to emit or withhold an action independent from subsequent receipt of reward or avoidance of punishment. During anticipation, in the striatum and a lateral region within the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), action representations dominated over valence representations. Moreover, we did not observe any representation associated with different state values through accumulation of outcomes, challenging a conventional and dominant association between these areas and state value representations. In contrast, a more medial sector of the SN/VTA responded preferentially to valence, with opposite signs depending on whether action was anticipated to be emitted or withheld. This dominant influence of action requires an enriched notion of opponency between reward and punishment.","Indeed, a coupling of action and reward could affect choice-induced preference change as it has been linked to dopaminergic circuitry [#AUTHOR_TAG,17] and an effect in the striatum [10,18].","['There are number of reasons to hypothesize that choice and choice-induced preference change are modulated by action.', 'A recent study [14] reported that the relative value of visually represented items is enhanced by button presses to a coinciding auditory cue.', ""This 'cue-approach training' increased choice preference for otherwise equally valued items and led to a subsequently increased valuation."", 'Interestingly, this effect was only seen for items with relatively high value.', 'Additionally, a revaluation effect was driven by a value change induced by the preceding choice, indicating a specificity of the cue approach training to bias the binary choice between two items.', 'The observation that the effect is only present for high value items points to a specific interaction of approach with choice and positive value.', 'We believe that this is consistent with a Pavlovian congruence framework [15], in which button presses are a model for approach behaviour.', 'Indeed, a coupling of action and reward could affect choice-induced preference change as it has been linked to dopaminergic circuitry [#AUTHOR_TAG,17] and an effect in the striatum [10,18].', 'Therefore, we hypothesize a value enhancing effect by action in a context of positive value.']",0,"['Indeed, a coupling of action and reward could affect choice-induced preference change as it has been linked to dopaminergic circuitry [#AUTHOR_TAG,17] and an effect in the striatum [10,18].']"

J. Dolan""]","Humans tend to modify their attitudes to align with past action. For example, after choosing between similarly valued alternatives, people rate the selected option as better than they originally did, and the rejected option as worse. However, it is unknown whether these modifications in evaluation reflect an underlying change in the physiological representation of a stimulus' expected hedonic value and our emotional response to it. Here, we addressed this question by combining participants' estimations of the pleasure they will derive from future events, with brain imaging data recorded while they imagined those events, both before, and after, choosing between them. Participants rated the selected alternatives as better after the decision stage relative to before, whereas discarded alternatives were valued less. Our functional magnetic resonance imaging findings reveal that postchoice changes in preference are tracked in caudate nucleus activity. Specifically, the difference in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal associated with the selected and rejected stimuli was enhanced after a decision was taken, reflecting the choice that had just been made. This finding suggests that the physiological representation of a stimulus' expected hedonic value is altered by a commitment to it. Furthermore, before any revaluation induced by the decision process, our data show that BOLD signal in this same region reflects the choices we are likely to make at a later time.","Indeed, a coupling of action and reward could affect choice-induced preference change as it has been linked to dopaminergic circuitry [16,17] and an effect in the striatum [10,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['There are number of reasons to hypothesize that choice and choice-induced preference change are modulated by action.', 'A recent study [14] reported that the relative value of visually represented items is enhanced by button presses to a coinciding auditory cue.', ""This 'cue-approach training' increased choice preference for otherwise equally valued items and led to a subsequently increased valuation."", 'Interestingly, this effect was only seen for items with relatively high value.', 'Additionally, a revaluation effect was driven by a value change induced by the preceding choice, indicating a specificity of the cue approach training to bias the binary choice between two items.', 'The observation that the effect is only present for high value items points to a specific interaction of approach with choice and positive value.', 'We believe that this is consistent with a Pavlovian congruence framework [15], in which button presses are a model for approach behaviour.', 'Indeed, a coupling of action and reward could affect choice-induced preference change as it has been linked to dopaminergic circuitry [16,17] and an effect in the striatum [10,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'Therefore, we hypothesize a value enhancing effect by action in a context of positive value.']",0,"['There are number of reasons to hypothesize that choice and choice-induced preference change are modulated by action.', 'Indeed, a coupling of action and reward could affect choice-induced preference change as it has been linked to dopaminergic circuitry [16,17] and an effect in the striatum [10,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'Therefore, we hypothesize a value enhancing effect by action in a context of positive value.']"

Using computational reinforcement-learning models, we teased apart contributions from putatively instrumental and Pavlovian components in the generation of the observed asymmetry during learning. Moreover, using model-based fMRI, we showed that BOLD signals in striatum and substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) correlated with instrumentally learnt action values, but with opposite signs for go and no-go choices.

J. Crockett"", ""L. Clark"", ""T. W. Robbins""]","The neuromodulator serotonin has been implicated in a large number of affective and executive functions, but its precise contribution to motivation remains unclear. One influential hypothesis has implicated serotonin in aversive processing; another has proposed a more general role for serotonin in behavioral inhibition. Because behavioral inhibition is a prepotent reaction to aversive outcomes, it has been a challenge to reconcile these two accounts. Here, we show that serotonin is critical for punishment-induced inhibition but not overall motor response inhibition or reporting aversive outcomes. We used acute tryptophan depletion to temporarily lower brain serotonin in healthy human volunteers as they completed a novel task designed to obtain separate measures of motor response inhibition, punishment-induced inhibition, and sensitivity to aversive outcomes. After a placebo treatment, participants were slower to respond under punishment conditions compared with reward conditions. Tryptophan depletion abolished this punishment-induced inhibition without affecting overall motor response inhibition or the ability to adjust response bias in line with punishment contingencies. The magnitude of reduction in punishment-induced inhibition depended on the degree to which tryptophan depletion reduced plasma tryptophan levels. These findings extend and clarify previous research on the role of serotonin in aversive processing and behavioral inhibition and fit with current theorizing on the involvement of serotonin in predicting aversive outcomes.","In this regard the findings add to an emerging picture that action expression in itself is relevant for valuation and behavior [16,17,[24][25]#AUTHOR_TAG.","['Consistency of choice and valuation (choice spread independent of whether the choice was made before or after revaluation) was higher when stimuli were of positive valence.', 'This choice consistency is not merely revaluation caused by the choice but also includes conforming the choice to fluctuations in valuation.', 'The fact that this effect was stronger for positive stimuli shows a choice bias that is sensitive to stimulus valence.', 'Additionally, the magnitude of the choice-induced preference change was not modulated by action or valence per se, but by their interaction.', 'This effect was driven by changes across all conditions, including the control condition.', 'Schonberg at al.

The effect of commission is not simply an exaggerated response to commissions: a reverse effect for good outcomes was not found, and a few subjects were even willing to accept greater harm in order to avoid action.

M. Huys"", ""Michael J. Frank"", ""Rumana Chowdhury"", ""Emrah Duzel"", ""Peter Dayan"", ""Raymond J. Dolan""]","Rationale: Decision-making involves two fundamental axes of control namely valence, spanning reward and punishment, and action, spanning invigoration and inhibition. We recently exploited a go/no-go task whose contingencies explicitly decouple valence and action to show that these axes are inextricably coupled during learning. This results in a disadvantage in learning to go to avoid punishment and in learning to no-go to obtain a reward. The neuromodulators dopamine and serotonin are likely to play a role in these asymmetries: Dopamine signals anticipation of future rewards and is also involved in an invigoration of motor responses leading to reward, but it also arbitrates between different forms of control. Conversely, serotonin is implicated in motor inhibition and punishment processing. Objective: To investigate the role of dopamine and serotonin in the interaction between action and valence during learning. Methods: We combined computational modeling with pharmacological manipulation in 90 healthy human volunteers, using levodopa and citalopram to affect dopamine and serotonin, respectively. Results: We found that, after administration of levodopa, action learning was less affected by outcome valence when compared with the placebo and citalopram groups. This highlights in this context a predominant effect of levodopa in controlling the balance between different forms of control. Citalopram had distinct effects, increasing participants' tendency to perform active responses independent of outcome valence, consistent with a role in decreasing motor inhibition. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the rich complexities of the roles played by dopamine and serotonin during instrumental learning.

Dolan"", ""Emrah D\u00fczel""]","Flexible instrumental learning is required to harness the appropriate behaviors to obtain rewards and to avoid punishments. The precise contribution of dopaminergic midbrain regions (substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area [SN/VTA]) to this form of behavioral adaptation remains unclear. Normal aging is associated with a variable loss of dopamine neurons in the SN/VTA. We therefore tested the relationship between flexible instrumental learning and midbrain structural integrity. We compared task performance on a probabilistic monetary go/no-go task, involving trial and error learning of: ""go to win,"" ""no-go to win,"" ""go to avoid losing,"" and ""no-go to avoid losing"" in 42 healthy older adults to previous behavioral data from 47 younger adults. Quantitative structural magnetization transfer images were obtained to index regional structural integrity. On average, both some younger and some older participants demonstrated a behavioral asymmetry whereby they were better at learning to act for reward (""go to win"" > ""no-go to win""), but better at learning not to act to avoid punishment (""no-go to avoid losing"" > ""go to avoid losing""). Older, but not younger, participants with greater structural integrity of the SN/VTA and the adjacent subthalamic nucleus could overcome this asymmetry. We show that interindividual variability among healthy older adults of the structural integrity within the SN/VTA and subthalamic nucleus relates to effective acquisition of competing instrumental responses.

Guitart-Masip"", ""Q. Huys"", ""M. J.

This bias is not always adaptive-it can often interfere with instrumental requirements. The prefrontal cortex is thought to help resolve such conflict between motivational systems, but the nature of this control process remains unknown. EEG recordings of midfrontal theta band power are sensitive to conflict and predictive of adaptive control over behavior, but it is not clear whether this signal reflects control over conflict between motivational systems. Here we used a task that orthogonalized action requirements and outcome valence while recording concurrent EEG in human participants. By applying a computational model of task performance, we derived parameters reflective of the latent influence of Pavlovian bias and how it was modulated by midfrontal theta power during motivational conflict. Between subjects, those who performed better under Pavlovian conflict exhibited higher midfrontal theta power. Within subjects, trial-to-trial variance in theta power was predictive of ability to overcome the influence of the Pavlovian bias, and this effect was most pronounced in subjects with higher midfrontal theta to conflict. These findings demonstrate that midfrontal theta is not only a sensitive index of prefrontal control, but it can also reflect the application of top-down control over instrumental processes.","Given that this bias is independent of valence it may reflect a general action bias observed in instrumental learning under uncertainty [24,[30][31]#AUTHOR_TAG.","['The results also demonstrate how choice can be biased towards action.', 'The fact that choices associated with action are preferred over choices associated with inaction suggests a possible source for suboptimal decision making.', 'Given that this bias is independent of valence it may reflect a general action bias observed in instrumental learning under uncertainty [24,[30][31]#AUTHOR_TAG.', 'This choice bias is especially interesting because it makes explanations of enhanced revaluation due to effort [33,34] less plausible for the effect of action on the dynamics of choice-induced preference change.', 'If the key press was perceived as effortful one would expect subjects to be biased against pressing the key, as item values were closely matched.', 'By contrast, a general bias towards action could be explained by a higher hedonic value of action itself if inaction is perceived as inhibition [35,36].']",0,"['Given that this bias is independent of valence it may reflect a general action bias observed in instrumental learning under uncertainty [24,[30][31]#AUTHOR_TAG.']"

It has been suggested that intentional inhibition is associated with negative hedonic value, perhaps due to the frustration of cancelling an intended action. Here we investigate hedonic implications of the free choice to act or inhibit. Participants gave aesthetic ratings of arbitrary visual stimuli that immediately followed voluntary decisions to act or to inhibit action. We found that participants for whom decisions to act produced a strong positive hedonic value for the immediately following visual stimulus made more choices to act than those with weaker hedonic value for action. This finding is consistent with reinforcement learning of action decisions. However, participants who experienced inhibition as generating more positive hedonic value did not choose to inhibit more than other participants. Thus, voluntary inhibition of action did not act as reinforcement for future inhibitory behaviour. Our finding that inhibition of action lacks motivational capacity may explain why self-control is both difficult and limited.","By contrast, a general bias towards action could be explained by a higher hedonic value of action itself if inaction is perceived as inhibition [#AUTHOR_TAG,36].","['The results also demonstrate how choice can be biased towards action.', 'The fact that choices associated with action are preferred over choices associated with inaction suggests a possible source for suboptimal decision making.', 'Given that this bias is independent of valence it may reflect a general action bias observed in instrumental learning under uncertainty [24,[30][31][32].', 'This choice bias is especially interesting because it makes explanations of enhanced revaluation due to effort [33,34] less plausible for the effect of action on the dynamics of choice-induced preference change.', 'If the key press was perceived as effortful one would expect subjects to be biased against pressing the key, as item values were closely matched.', 'By contrast, a general bias towards action could be explained by a higher hedonic value of action itself if inaction is perceived as inhibition [#AUTHOR_TAG,36].']",3,"['By contrast, a general bias towards action could be explained by a higher hedonic value of action itself if inaction is perceived as inhibition [#AUTHOR_TAG,36].']"

Conflict theory has generally dealt, however, with the phenomena that lead up to the choice. What happens after the choice has received little attention. The present paper is concerned with some of the consequences of making a choice. Previous consideration of the consequences of choice have been limited to relatively unspecified hypotheses (1, 3) or to qualitative analysis (4). However, a recent theory by Festinger (2) makes possible several explicit predictions. According to this analysis of the choice situation, all cognitive elements (items of information) that favor the chosen alternative are ""consonant,"" and all cognitive elements that favor the unchosen alternative are ""dissonant"" with the choice behavior. Furthermore, other things being equal, the greater the number of elements favoring the unchosen alternative (i.e., the greater the relative attractiveness of the unchosen alternative) the greater the resulting ""dissonance."" When ""dissonance"" exists, the person will attempt to eliminate or reduce it. Although space limitations preclude further discussion of the theory, it may be said that several derivations are possible concerning the consequences of making a choice. The present study was designed to test the following: 1. Choosing between two alternatives creates dissonance and a consequent pressure to reduce it. The dissonance is reduced by making the chosen alternative more desirable and the unchosen alternative less desirable after the choice than they were before it. 2.

O'Doherty"", ""Michael M. Berkebile"", ""David Linderman"", ""Adam R. Aron""]","Impulsive behavior in humans partly relates to inappropriate overvaluation of reward-associated stimuli. Hence, it is desirable to develop methods of behavioral modification that can reduce stimulus value. Here, we tested whether one kind of behavioral modification--the rapid stopping of actions in the face of reward-associated stimuli--could lead to subsequent devaluation of those stimuli. We developed a novel paradigm with three consecutive phases: implicit reward learning, a stop-signal task, and an auction procedure. In the learning phase, we associated abstract shapes with different levels of reward. In the stop-signal phase, we paired half those shapes with occasional stop-signals, requiring the rapid stopping of an initiated motor response, while the other half of shapes was not paired with stop signals. In the auction phase, we assessed the subjective value of each shape via willingness-to-pay. In 2 experiments, we found that participants bid less for shapes that were paired with stop-signals compared to shapes that were not. This suggests that the requirement to try to rapidly stop a response decrements stimulus value. Two follow-on control experiments suggested that the result was specifically due to stopping action rather than aversiveness, effort, conflict, or salience associated with stop signals.

This effect to fit preferences with past choice, is known as ""choice-induced preference change."" After making a choice between two equally attractive options, one tends to rate the chosen option better than they initially did and/or the unchosen option worse. The present study examined how behavioral choice changes subsequent preference, using facial images for the choice options as well as blind choice techniques. Participants rated their facial preference for each face, and chose between two equally preferred faces and subsequently rated their facial preference. Results from four experiments demonstrated that randomly chosen faces were more preferred only after participants were required to choose ""a preferred face,"" (in Experiment 1) but not ""an unpreferred face,"" (in Experiment 2) or ""a rounder face"" (in Experiment 3). Further, preference change was still observed after participants were informed that choices were actually random (in Experiment 4). Our findings provide new and important implications characterizing the conditions under which random choice changes preference, and show that people are tempted to make a biased evaluation even after they know that they did not make the choice for themselves.","However, despite this flaw in the literature recent studies replicated choice-induced preference change with experimental designs that account for this artefact [9][10][11]#AUTHOR_TAG[13].","['The observation that choices express, but also shape our preferences is a consistent finding [5].', 'One paradigm demonstrating how choice affects preferences is the free-choice paradigm wherein value judgements are gathered on options before and after subjects are forced to choose one and reject the other option [6,7].', 'Post choice the chosen option is valued higher than the unchosen option, a spread seen for hard choices (options the subject initially valued similarly) but not easy choices (options which the subject initially valued differently).', 'A classical explanation of this finding is that it reflects a reduction of cognitive dissonance [8] where attitudes are changed to evaluate the current reality more positively.', 'A recent study has highlighted a methodological flaw in the way many studies on choice-induced preference change have been conducted [6].', 'As all valuations contain noise, chosen items are less likely to decrease in a second valuation because the choice accesses the same true underlying value.', 'This is strikingly revealed by a control condition in which a choice is made after the second evaluation, ruling out any causal influence of the choice on the change in valuation (see Izuma & Murayama [7] for review).', 'However, despite this flaw in the literature recent studies replicated choice-induced preference change with experimental designs that account for this artefact [9][10][11]#AUTHOR_TAG[13].']",0,"['The observation that choices express, but also shape our preferences is a consistent finding [5].', 'One paradigm demonstrating how choice affects preferences is the free-choice paradigm wherein value judgements are gathered on options before and after subjects are forced to choose one and reject the other option [6,7].', 'However, despite this flaw in the literature recent studies replicated choice-induced preference change with experimental designs that account for this artefact [9][10][11]#AUTHOR_TAG[13].']"

Recently, critics of this view have argued that choosing simply reveals preexisting preferences, and that all studies claiming that choice shapes preferences suffer from a fundamental methodological flaw. Here we address this question directly by dissociating preexisting preferences from decision making. We studied participants who rated different vacation destinations both before and after making a blind choice that could not be guided by preexisting preferences. As an additional control, we elicited ratings in a condition in which a computer made the decision for the participants. We found that preferences were altered after participants made a blind choice, but not after a computer dictated the decision.

Consequently, subsequent behavior might reflect not hedonic utility but rather this erroneously imputed utility that lingers in memory.

Branscombe""]","Norm theory's prediction that actions are more mutable than inactions and, as a consequence, will elicit more regret following a negative outcome was tested in two experiments. Action and inaction mutation frequencies were assessed in a design where both types of behaviors were presented together and when information about only one type was described. In Experiment 1, Kahneman and Tversky's (1982a) original scenario, where the action or inaction was instrumentally related to the negative outcome, was employed. More intense regret was obtained for the acting target than the nonacting one, but only when the information about both targets was presented simultaneously and not when either was presented alone. More importantly, action was not more frequently mutated than inaction and what was mutated was uncorrelated with the regret ratings. Instead, the active target's regret was correlated with the perceived wisdom of the nonacting target's behavioral choice when both targets were presented together and could be compared. In Experiment 2, where the action and inaction were not instrumentally related to the negative outcome, no emotional amplification was observed and inaction was targeted for mutation more often than was action. Discussion focuses on an alternative mechanism, besides mutability, that can account for differential emotion elicitation and on specifying the conditions under which the emotion effect will or will not occur.","This asymmetry of regret for action and inaction has been linked to a number of possible explanations and mediating factors including sense of agency [1], cognitive accessibility [2], and differential mutability [3,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['Choosing according to our preferences is an everyday occurrence in our lives.', 'Some choices are expressed explicitly through action while others are expressed passively by accepting a default or not altering an existing choice.', 'Interestingly, an xkcd comic titled ""Regrets"" (http://xkcd.', 'com/458/) points out that there are more Google hits for ""I should have kissed him/her"" compared to ""I shouldn\'t have kissed him/her"".', 'This asymmetry of regret for action and inaction has been linked to a number of possible explanations and mediating factors including sense of agency [1], cognitive accessibility [2], and differential mutability [3,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'Another possible explanation for this effect is that the consequences of actions are revaluated more easily than the consequences of inaction.', 'In this study we ask how different modes of choice expression, i.e. action and inaction, shape the choice process and the following choice-induced preference change in different valence contexts.']",0,"['This asymmetry of regret for action and inaction has been linked to a number of possible explanations and mediating factors including sense of agency [1], cognitive accessibility [2], and differential mutability [3,#AUTHOR_TAG].']"

Work-related psychological health was assessed by the Francis Burnout Inventory which distinguishes between positive affect (the Satisfaction in Ministry Scale) and negative affect (the Scale of Emotional Exhaustion in Ministry). The data demonstrated that these clergy display high levels of negative affect coupled with high levels of positive affect. The data also confirmed that the main association between work-related psychological health and psychological type is a function of the orientations (the source of psychological energy). Compared with clergy who prefer introversion, clergy who prefer extraversion display both higher levels of satisfaction in ministry and lower levels of emotional exhaustion in ministry. These findings are consistent with the theory that the extraverted nature of ministry requires introverted clergy to operate for considerable periods of time outside their preferred orientations, with the consequent loss of energy and the consequent erosion of psychological rewards.

The Maslach Burnout Inventory - Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) is a widely used tool to measure burnout. The objective of this study was to compare the MBI-HSS and a two-question tool to determine burnout in the EM resident population.Methods: Based on data from the 2017 National Emergency Medicine Resident Wellness Survey study, we determined the correlation between two single-item questions with their respective MBI subscales and the full MBI-HSS. We then compared a 2-Question Summative Score to the full MBI-HSS with respect to primary, more restrictive, and more inclusive definitions of burnout previously reported in the literature.Results: Of 1,522 residents who completed the survey 37.0% reported ""I feel burned out from my work,"" and 47.1% reported ""I have become more callous toward people since I took this job"" once a week or more (each item &gt;3 on a scale of 0-6).

As an internal personal resource, psychological well-being is considered as the basis of personal psychological  security.  As an integral personal entity, psychological well-being functions dynamically and therefore it is a personal motivational parameter, the degree of its expressiveness depends on realism, structuring, integrity (consistency of the past, present and future), of the system of personal attitudes and life perspectives, which includes goals, plans, values and aspirations.  The article determines that personal psychological well-being correlates with the value-sense orientations (life goals, a life process, efficiency of life) and personal resilience. Therefore, personal psychological well-being can be understood as a psychological basis of personal security, having a self-regulatory function of preserving of personal integrity and stability as a psychological system.  The personal potential of psychological well-being means materialisation of innate resources accumulated by a person as a result of comprehension of links between personal past, present and future in terms of  implementation of own capabilities and achievement of life prospects - reserves of full realization in the present and possibilities of development of personal vital forces, labour and spiritual capabilities in the future","Challenging Maslach's three dimensional model of burnout, Francis, Kaldor, Robbins, and Castle (2005) argued that a more empirically economic and theoretically coherent model of clergy work-related psychological health could be developed from #AUTHOR_TAG's (1969) classic notion of 'balanced affect', according to which positive affect and negative affect are not opposite ends of a single continuum, but two separate continua.","['Although a number of researchers have used the Maslach Burnout Inventory among clergy, the wording of some of the items may not be particularly appropriate for the clerical profession.', 'To address this problem, Rutledge and Francis (2004) obtained permission from the Consulting Psychologist Press to reshape some of the items of the Maslach Burnout Inventory to reflect better the experience and language of the clerical profession, and at the same time to develop some new items relevant to the clerical profession that would bring the three subscales to the same length of ten items each.', 'A series of studies has reported findings employing this modified form of the Maslach Burnout Inventory in the United Kingdom among Roman Catholic priests engaged in parochial ministry (Francis, Louden, & Rutledge, 2004;Francis, Turton, & ASSESSING WORK-RELATED PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH Louden, 2007) and among Anglican parochial clergy (Francis & Rutledge, 2000;Francis & Turton, 2004a, 2004bRandall, 2004Randall, , 2007Rutledge, 2006;.', 'The modified Maslach Burnout Inventory for use among clergy has been further modified and refined by Hills, Francis, and Rutledge (2004).', ""Challenging Maslach's three dimensional model of burnout, Francis, Kaldor, Robbins, and Castle (2005) argued that a more empirically economic and theoretically coherent model of clergy work-related psychological health could be developed from #AUTHOR_TAG's (1969) classic notion of 'balanced affect', according to which positive affect and negative affect are not opposite ends of a single continuum, but two separate continua."", 'According to this model it is totally reasonable for individual clergy to experience at one and the same time high levels of positive affect and high levels of negative affect.', 'According to this model of balanced affect, warning signs of poor work-related psychological health occur when high levels of negative affect coincide with low levels of positive affect.', 'In terms of the work-related experiences of clergy, Francis, Kaldor, Robbins, and Castle (2005) translated negative affect into emotional exhaustion and positive affect into ministry satisfaction.', 'These two work-related constructs were then operationalised by separate 11-item scales: Scale of Emotional Exhaustion in Ministry (SEEM), first reported by Francis, Kaldor, Shevlin, & Lewis (2004), and Satisfaction in Ministry Scale (SIMS).', 'Together these two scales comprise the Francis Burnout Inventory (FBI).', 'Recent studies employing the Francis Burnout Inventory have been reported by Francis, Wulff, andRobbins (2008), Francis, Robbins, Kaldor, andCastle (2009), Robbins and Francis (2010) and Brewster, Francis, and Robbins (2011).']",5,"[""Challenging Maslach's three dimensional model of burnout, Francis, Kaldor, Robbins, and Castle (2005) argued that a more empirically economic and theoretically coherent model of clergy work-related psychological health could be developed from #AUTHOR_TAG's (1969) classic notion of 'balanced affect', according to which positive affect and negative affect are not opposite ends of a single continuum, but two separate continua.""]"

Two theories are often advanced to account for this: those who suffered from emotional exhaustion or depersonalization at a younger age may have left the job either on grounds of ill-health or to seek alternative employment; older workers may have learned how better to pace themselves in their work in order to minimize opportunities for burnout. The present study sought to evaluate these two theories. A sample of 340 Anglican clergy in England and Wales, who had all served one year in ordained ministry, completed a modified form of the Maslach Burnout Inventory, alongside a variety of socio-demographic questions, including age and years in ministry. The results show that it is chronological age, and not years in ministry, that is negatively correlated with the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization subscales of burnout.

Although items or scales may be characterized as high or low in SD, there is little evidence that individuals differentially respond to this property when completing self-report questionnaires under normal instructional conditions. In an attempt to separate substance from style in SD scales, self-reports from 215 27Ð89 yr olds were compared to the external criterion of spouse ratings on a range of personality traits in the domains of neuroticism, extraversion, and openness to experience (the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Inventory).

Subjects included 188 child care workers from licensed child care centers in predominantly rural areas of Pennsylvania. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess the extent to which personality (neuroticism, extraversion), background characteristics (education/training, work experience), and perceptions of the work setting (work role conflict, work role ambiguity, organizational commitment, job satisfaction) were associated with three facets of burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment). The results indicate that neuroticism, work role conflict, and work role ambiguity were positively associated with higher levels of burnout as measured by all three facets.

Miner""]","Working in Christian ministry is stressful because it is focused on the intangible spirituality of people within a secularized society. Consequently, clergy are at risk of burnout. An internal orientation to the demands of ministry (where ministers depend on internal sources of authority and coping, such as spirituality and competence) is associated with low burnout in cross-sectional studies of ministers. However, little is known about stressors in early ministry and whether an internal ministry orientation is associated with burnout over the first year of ministry. Sixty graduating theological students completed demographic items, exploratory questions relating to the psychological effects of secularization, and measures of burnout, personality, and orientation to ministry. Most of these measures, together with ratings of stress and coping, were repeated after 12 months. Burnout increased over time in ministry, and ministers reported that ministry and relational issues were most stressful. Those with only a weakly internal orientation to ministry demands experienced higher levels of burnout on exit from theological college, and after 12 months. The results support a prediction from secularization theory, that the declining authority of ministers will have important consequences for their psychological health.","These studies included work reported by Warner and Carter (1984), Str�_mpfer and Bands (1996), Rodgerson and Piedmont (1998), Stanton-Rich and Iso-Ahola (1998), Virginia (1998), Evers and Tomic (2003), Golden, Piedmont, Ciarrocchi, and Rodgerson (2004), Raj and Dean (2005), #AUTHOR_TAG (2007a, 2007b and Doolittle (2007).","['In an attempt to bring greater scientific objectivity to the conceptualisation and assessment of clergy work-related psychological health, a number of studies have employed the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) established by Maslach and Jackson (1996).', 'These studies included work reported by Warner and Carter (1984), Str�_mpfer and Bands (1996), Rodgerson and Piedmont (1998), Stanton-Rich and Iso-Ahola (1998), Virginia (1998), Evers and Tomic (2003), Golden, Piedmont, Ciarrocchi, and Rodgerson (2004), Raj and Dean (2005), #AUTHOR_TAG (2007a, 2007b and Doolittle (2007).']",0,"['In an attempt to bring greater scientific objectivity to the conceptualisation and assessment of clergy work-related psychological health, a number of studies have employed the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) established by Maslach and Jackson (1996).', 'These studies included work reported by Warner and Carter (1984), Str�_mpfer and Bands (1996), Rodgerson and Piedmont (1998), Stanton-Rich and Iso-Ahola (1998), Virginia (1998), Evers and Tomic (2003), Golden, Piedmont, Ciarrocchi, and Rodgerson (2004), Raj and Dean (2005), #AUTHOR_TAG (2007a, 2007b and Doolittle (2007).']"

Successive exploratory and confirmatory analyses, combined with the stepwise removal of ambiguous or poorly fitting items, produced a refined 20-item, three factor scale with satisfactory psychometric properties. However, the three Maslachian factors were strongly intercorrelated. The results provided by the compact scale suggested that the clergy were not particularly subject to the adverse effects of burnout and that self-reported job satisfaction was high. Separate hierarchical regressions were conducted for each of the three dimensions with respect to several personality, demographic and job-related variables. Most of the variability in the data was accounted for by the intercorrelations among the three dimensions, but neuroticism was a significant predictor of exhaustion, psychoticism of depersonalization, and extraversion of achievement. Few of the demographic and job-related variables were significant predictors.

Adolescents on the persistent trajectory reported frequent victimization and consistent elevated scores in depression and anxiety. Adolescents on the increasing trajectory were engaging in cigarette use prior to any increases in PLEs and were engaging in cocaine, cannabis and other drug use as PLEs increased at later time points.The findings suggest that different developmental subgroups of PLEs exist in adolescence and are differentially related to victimization and substance use.","#AUTHOR_TAG, Castellanos-Ryan and Conrod (2011) found that distinct developmental trajectories can be identified in adolescent PLE, with ""persistent"" and ""increasing"" subclasses predicted by victimization and substance use.","['An important question is to what extent the AVH prevalence in this study relates to other PLE as well as the psychosis risk in the adolescent population.', 'Hallucinations (visual and auditory) consistently emerge as a distinct subtype of PLE.', 'Other PLE dimensions have been labeled as persecutory ideas, bizarre experiences and magical thinking (Yung, Nelson, Baker, Buckby, Baksheev & Cosgrave, 2009), or delusions, paranoia, grandiosity and paranormal beliefs (Wigman, Van Winkel, Raaijmakers et al., 2011a).', 'The PLE subtypes show correlation with each other (Yung et al., 2009).', 'However, the subtypes have also a differential risk for distress and poor functioning, and hallucinations are among the subtypes with the strongest risk (Wigman et al., 2011a;Yung et al., 2009).', '#AUTHOR_TAG, Castellanos-Ryan and Conrod (2011) found that distinct developmental trajectories can be identified in adolescent PLE, with ""persistent"" and ""increasing"" subclasses predicted by victimization and substance use.', 'Wigman, Vollebergh, Raaijmakers et al.

Yung"", ""Barnaby Nelson"", ""Kathryn Baker"", ""Joe A. Buckby"", ""Gennady Baksheev"", ""Elizabeth M.

Different types of psychotic symptoms may exist, some being normal variants and some having implications for mental health and functioning. The aim of the present study was to determine if different subtypes of psychotic-like experiences could be identified in a community sample of adolescents and to investigate if particular subtypes were more likely to be associated with psychosocial difficulties, that is, distress, depression and poor functioning, than other subtypes. Method: Eight hundred and seventy-five Year 10 students from 34 schools participated in a cross-sectional survey that measured psychotic-like experiences using the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences; depression using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; and psychosocial functioning using the Revised Multidimensional Assessment of Functioning Scale. Factor analysis was conducted to identify any subtypes of psychotic experiences. Results: Four subtypes of psychotic-like experiences were identified: Bizarre Experiences, Perceptual Abnormalities, Persecutory Ideas, and Magical Thinking. Intermittent, infrequent psychotic experiences were common, but frequent experiences were not. Bizarre Experiences, Perceptual Abnormalities and Persecutory Ideas were strongly associated with distress, depression and poor functioning. Magical Thinking was only weakly associated with these variables. Overall these findings may suggest that infrequent psychotic-like experiences are unlikely to be a specific risk factor for onset of a psychotic disorder in community samples. Conclusions: Given that the different subtypes had varying associations with current difficulties it is suggested that not all subtypes confer the same risk for onset of psychotic disorder and poor outcome. Bizarre Experiences, Perceptual Abnormalities and Persecutory Ideas may represent expressions of underlying vulnerability to psychotic disorder, but Magical Thinking may be a normal personality variant.","Other PLE dimensions have been labeled as persecutory ideas, bizarre experiences and magical thinking (#AUTHOR_TAG, Nelson, Baker, Buckby, Baksheev & Cosgrave, 2009), or delusions, paranoia, grandiosity and paranormal beliefs (Wigman, Van Winkel, Raaijmakers et al., 2011a).","['An important question is to what extent the AVH prevalence in this study relates to other PLE as well as the psychosis risk in the adolescent population.', 'Hallucinations (visual and auditory) consistently emerge as a distinct subtype of PLE.', 'Other PLE dimensions have been labeled as persecutory ideas, bizarre experiences and magical thinking (#AUTHOR_TAG, Nelson, Baker, Buckby, Baksheev & Cosgrave, 2009), or delusions, paranoia, grandiosity and paranormal beliefs (Wigman, Van Winkel, Raaijmakers et al., 2011a).', 'The PLE subtypes show correlation with each other (Yung et al., 2009).', 'However, the subtypes have also a differential risk for distress and poor functioning, and hallucinations are among the subtypes with the strongest risk (Wigman et al., 2011a;Yung et al., 2009).', 'Mackie, Castellanos-Ryan and Conrod (2011) found that distinct developmental trajectories can be identified in adolescent PLE, with ""persistent"" and ""increasing"" subclasses predicted by victimization and substance use.', 'Wigman, Vollebergh, Raaijmakers et al.

Studies 1 and 2 involved school-based surveys of 2243 children aged 11-16 years for psychotic symptoms and for emotional and behavioural symptoms of psychopathology. Studies 3 and 4 involved in-depth diagnostic interview assessments of psychotic symptoms and lifetime psychiatric disorders in community samples of 423 children aged 11-15 years.Younger adolescents had a higher prevalence (21-23%) of psychotic symptoms than older adolescents (7%). In both age groups the majority of adolescents who reported psychotic symptoms had at least one diagnosable non-psychotic psychiatric disorder, although associations with psychopathology increased with age: nearly 80% of the mid-adolescence sample who reported psychotic symptoms had at least one diagnosis, compared with 57% of the early adolescence sample. Adolescents who reported psychotic symptoms were at particularly high risk of having multiple co-occurring diagnoses.Psychotic symptoms are important risk markers for a wide range of non-psychotic psychopathological disorders, in particular for severe psychopathology characterised by multiple co-occurring diagnoses. These symptoms should be carefully assessed in all patients.","In contrast to the transient AVH, persistent AVH appear to increase the risk for depressed mood and general psychopathology in longitudinal studies (De Loore, Gunther, Drukker et al., 2011), and AVH in later adolescence appears to have stronger association with psychiatric disorders compared to AVH in younger age groups (#AUTHOR_TAG, Keeley, Corcoran et al., 2012b).","['Thus, developmental processes may influence the prevalence, as AVH appear to decrease throughout adolescence.', 'Consistent with this view, Bartels-Velthuis, Van de Willige, Jenner, Van Os and Wiersma (2011) found that approximately two thirds of children reporting hearing voices at ages 7-8 did not report such experiences five years later.', 'In contrast to the transient AVH, persistent AVH appear to increase the risk for depressed mood and general psychopathology in longitudinal studies (De Loore, Gunther, Drukker et al., 2011), and AVH in later adolescence appears to have stronger association with psychiatric disorders compared to AVH in younger age groups (#AUTHOR_TAG, Keeley, Corcoran et al., 2012b).', 'Similarly, Rubio, Sanju an, Fl orez-Salamanca and Cuesta (2012) reported in a systematic review an increased prevalence of AVH in younger age.', 'AVH were in most cases transient, whereas the persistence of AVH or transition to psychosis was suggested to be related to the severity of the hallucinatory experience (Rubio et al., 2012).']",0,"['In contrast to the transient AVH, persistent AVH appear to increase the risk for depressed mood and general psychopathology in longitudinal studies (De Loore, Gunther, Drukker et al., 2011), and AVH in later adolescence appears to have stronger association with psychiatric disorders compared to AVH in younger age groups (#AUTHOR_TAG, Keeley, Corcoran et al., 2012b).']"

However, few have investigated their joint and independent roles in the pursuit of a reliable, predictive model of suicidal behaviour.Data are from the National Comorbidity Survey (N = 5877), a nationally representative study of prevalence, risk factors, and social consequences of psychiatric disorders in the US. Discrete time survival analysis and population attributable risk methodologies were utilized.Among those sexually abused as children, odds of suicide attempts were 2-4 times higher among women and 4-11 times higher among men, compared with those not abused, controlling for other adversities. Odds ratios were reduced but most remained statistically significant after adjusting for lifetime psychiatric illnesses preceding suicide attempts. In the same predictive equation, 79% of serious suicide attempts among women could be attributed to psychiatric disorders while 12% was attributable to rape and 7% to molestation. The highest probability of a first attempt was during early adolescence for those who were sexually abused and had a lifetime disorder, but it was 8-12 years older for those sexually abused without any disorders.In the US, a strong association exists between child sexual abuse and suicidal behaviour, mediated by psychopathology. There is a substantial proportion of suicide risk attributable to child sexual abuse beyond the presence of psychopathology and other adversities. From a clinical standpoint, abuse survivors represent a high-risk population for suicidal behaviour. Further research into this preventable antecedent of suicide attempts is necessary.","Childhood trauma has also been shown to increase the risk for having AVH in adult age (Daalman, Diederen, Derks, van Lutterveld, Kahn & Sommer, 2012;Janssen, Krabbendam, Bak et al., 2004) and may also explain the higher rate of AVH in females as this is more often reported by females (Daalman et al., 2012;Janssen et al., 2004;#AUTHOR_TAG, Berkman & Buka, 2001).","['In addition to age, there are other variables that may affect the frequency of reporting AVH.', 'In clinical samples, rates of auditory hallucinations have been suggested to be higher in female patients (Rector & Seeman, 1992;Sharma, Dowd & Janicak, 1999), although there are many confounding variables which may account for apparent gender differences (e.g., sampling biases, comorbid depression, etc.).', 'In general non-clinical populations, women have been found to have higher incidence of positive psychotic symptoms (Maric, Krabbendam, Vollebergh, de Graaf & Van Os, 2003), and specifically auditory hallucinations (Shevlin, Murphy, Dorahy & Adamson, 2007;Tien, 1991).', 'However, this difference may be mediated by depression (Tien, 1991).', 'In young adults (age 18-24), a similar tendency for women reporting higher levels of hallucinations has been found (Scott, Welham, Martin et al., 2008).', 'It is not clear exactly when this tendency emerges due to few studies focusing on auditory hallucinations in adolescence.', 'Kelleher et al.

Hallucinations have consistently been associated with traumatic experiences during childhood. This association appears strongest between physical and sexual abuse and auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). It remains unclear whether traumatic experiences mainly colour the content of AVH or whether childhood trauma triggers the vulnerability to experience hallucinations in general. In order to investigate the association between hallucinations, childhood trauma and the emotional content of hallucinations, experienced trauma and phenomenology of AVH were investigated in non-psychotic individuals and in patients with a psychotic disorder who hear voices. Method. A total of 127 non-psychotic individuals with frequent AVH, 124 healthy controls and 100 psychotic patients with AVH were assessed for childhood trauma. Prevalence of childhood trauma was compared between groups and the relation between characteristics of voices, especially emotional valence of content, and childhood trauma was investigated. Results. Both non-psychotic individuals with AVH and patients with a psychotic disorder and AVH experienced more sexual and emotional abuse compared with the healthy controls. No difference in the prevalence of traumatic experiences could be observed between the two groups experiencing AVH. In addition, no type of childhood trauma could distinguish between positive or negative emotional valence of the voices and associated distress. No correlations were found between sexual abuse and emotional abuse and other AVH characteristics. Conclusions. These results suggest that sexual and emotional trauma during childhood render a person more vulnerable to experience AVH in general, which can be either positive voices without associated distress or negative voices as part of a psychotic disorde","Childhood trauma has also been shown to increase the risk for having AVH in adult age #AUTHOR_TAG, Diederen, Derks, van Lutterveld, Kahn & Sommer, 2012;Janssen, Krabbendam, Bak et al., 2004) and may also explain the higher rate of AVH in females as this is more often reported by females (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012;Janssen et al., 2004;Molnar, Berkman & Buka, 2001).","['In addition to age, there are other variables that may affect the frequency of reporting AVH.', 'In clinical samples, rates of auditory hallucinations have been suggested to be higher in female patients (Rector & Seeman, 1992;Sharma, Dowd & Janicak, 1999), although there are many confounding variables which may account for apparent gender differences (e.g., sampling biases, comorbid depression, etc.).', 'In general non-clinical populations, women have been found to have higher incidence of positive psychotic symptoms (Maric, Krabbendam, Vollebergh, de Graaf & Van Os, 2003), and specifically auditory hallucinations (Shevlin, Murphy, Dorahy & Adamson, 2007;Tien, 1991).', 'However, this difference may be mediated by depression (Tien, 1991).', 'In young adults (age 18-24), a similar tendency for women reporting higher levels of hallucinations has been found (Scott, Welham, Martin et al., 2008).', 'It is not clear exactly when this tendency emerges due to few studies focusing on auditory hallucinations in adolescence.', 'Kelleher et al.

In the ECA data, the incidence of visual hallucinations was slightly higher in males (about 20 per 1000 per year) than females (about 13 per 1000 per year) across the age span from 18 to 80 years old, with a subsequent increase in the rate for females (up to about 40 per 1000 per year) after age 80. For auditory hallucinations there was an age 25-30 peak in males with a trough for females, and a later age 40-50 peak for females. Overall, there were substantial gender differences, and the effect of aging to increase the incidence of hallucinations was the most consistent and prominent. The Sidgewick study showed a much higher proportion of visual hallucinations than the ECA program.

METHOD Data were derived from a general population sample of 4045 subjects aged 18-64 years. First ever onset of positive psychotic symptoms at 2-year follow-up were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and additional clinical interviews if necessary. Childhood abuse was assessed at baseline.   RESULTS Baseline reported childhood abuse predicted development of positive psychotic symptoms associated with need for care [odds ratio (OR) = 11.5, 95% CI 2.6-51.6]. This association remained after adjustment for demographic variables, reported risk factors and presence of any lifetime psychiatric diagnosis at baseline (OR = 7.3, 95% CI 1.1-49.0).

It is unclear whether these hallucinations occur as an isolated phenomenon or if AVH in nonclinical individuals are part of a more general susceptibility to schizophrenia. For this study, 103 healthy individuals with frequent AVH were compared with 60 controls matched for sex, age, and education. All participants were examined by a psychiatrist using standardized diagnostic interviews and questionnaires. The individuals with AVH did not have clinically defined delusions, disorganization, or negative or catatonic symptoms, nor did they meet criteria for cluster A personality disorder. However, their global level of functioning was lower than in the controls and there was a pronounced increase on all subclusters of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) and the Peters Delusion Inventory, indicating a general increased schizotypal and delusional tendency in the hallucinating subjects. History of childhood trauma and family history of axis I disorders were also more prevalent in these individuals. We showed that higher SPQ scores, lower education, and higher family loading for psychiatric disorders, but not presence of AVH, were associated with lower global functioning.

We administered a screening questionnaire with 7 items designed to assess psychotic-like experiences to 334 adolescents aged 11-13 years. Detailed clinical interviews were subsequently carried out with a sample of these adolescents. We calculated sensitivity and specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for each screening question for the specific symptom it enquired about and also in relation to any psychotic-like experience. The predictive power varied substantially between items, with the question on auditory hallucinations (""Have you ever heard voices or sounds that no one else can hear?"") providing the best predictive power. For interview-verified auditory hallucinations specifically, this question had a PPV of 71.4% and an NPV of 90.4%. When assessed for its predictive power for any psychotic-like experience (including, but not limited to, auditory hallucinations), it provided a PPV of 100% and an NPV of 88.4%.

The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to identify DLE, common psychiatric disorders, and physical disorders. Individual-level and area-level socio-economic disadvantage measures were available based on variables including income, educational attainment, employment status, and housing. We examined the relationship between the variables of interest using logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounding factors.Of the 8773 subjects, 8.4% (n=776) positively endorsed one or more DLE. DLE screen items were more likely to be endorsed by those who were (a) younger, (b) never married, or widowed, separated or divorced status, (c) migrants, or (d) living in rented houses. There were significant associations between socio-economic disadvantage and increased DLE endorsement, and this was found for both individual-level and area-level measures of socio-economic disadvantage.

The interpretation of the results was conducted in relation to the study design variables.A total of 11 datasets (6 epidemiological and 5 clinical) were reviewed. The baseline prevalence of hallucinatory experiences ranged from 4.9% to 9%. Discontinuation occurred in between 58.7% and 94.5% of the cases, and person-year discontinuation rates ranged from 3% to 40.7% and appeared to be related to the duration of follow-up. Despite low person-year incidence rate, incident cases constituted between 27.7% and 83.3% of outcome samples. 2 of 3 studies showed evidence to predict transition to psychosis with likelihood ratios of 2.5 and 6.6.Hallucinatory experiences are a common experience during childhood and adolescence. A review of the current literature suggests that there is a considerable turnover of incident-discontinuing cases and that most cases discontinue in the short term.

RESULTS A number of differences between the sexes in rates of illness and course of illness are documented, with Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, alcoholism, and mood and anxiety disorders each illustrating slightly different hormone-mediated risks and buffers.   CONCLUSIONS Estrogens are neuroprotective with respect to neuronal degeneration, growth, and susceptibility to toxins.

Sommer"", ""Jean-Paul Selten"", ""Kelly M.

Audibility, the perceptual aspect of AVH, may result from a disinhibition of the auditory cortex in response to self-generated speech. In isolation, this aspect leads to audible thoughts: Gedankenlautwerden. The second component is alienation, which is the failure to recognize the content of AVH as self-generated. This failure may be related to the fact that cerebral activity associated with AVH is predominantly present in the speech production area of the right hemisphere. Since normal inner speech is derived from the left speech area, an aberrant source may lead to confusion about the origin of the language fragments. When alienation is not accompanied by audibility, it will result in the experience of thought insertion. The 2 hypothesized components are illustrated using case vignettes.Copyright 2010 S.

This study aimed to describe the distribution of positive psychosis-like symptoms in the general population by means of latent class analysis.Latent class analysis was used to identify homogeneous sub-types of psychosis-like experiences. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to interpret the nature of the latent classes, or groups, by estimating the associations with demographic factors, clinical variables, and experiences of traumatic events.The best fitting latent class model was a four-class solution: a psychosis class, a hallucinatory class, an intermediate class, and a normative class. The associations between the latent classes and the demographic risk factors, clinical variables, and experiences of traumatic events showed significantly higher risks for the psychosis class, the hallucinatory class, and the intermediate class compared to the normative class. Furthermore there appeared to be a grading in the magnitude of the odds ratios: the odds ratios for the psychosis group were generally higher than those for the hallucinatory class, and the odds ratios for the hallucinatory class were generally higher than those for the intermediate class.The latent class analysis showed that psychosis-like symptoms at the population level could be best explained by four groups that appeared to represent an underlying continuum.","In general non-clinical populations, women have been found to have higher incidence of positive psychotic symptoms (Maric, Krabbendam, Vollebergh, de Graaf & Van Os, 2003), and specifically auditory hallucinations (#AUTHOR_TAG, Murphy, Dorahy & Adamson, 2007;Tien, 1991).","['In addition to age, there are other variables that may affect the frequency of reporting AVH.', 'In clinical samples, rates of auditory hallucinations have been suggested to be higher in female patients (Rector & Seeman, 1992;Sharma, Dowd & Janicak, 1999), although there are many confounding variables which may account for apparent gender differences (e.g., sampling biases, comorbid depression, etc.).', 'In general non-clinical populations, women have been found to have higher incidence of positive psychotic symptoms (Maric, Krabbendam, Vollebergh, de Graaf & Van Os, 2003), and specifically auditory hallucinations (#AUTHOR_TAG, Murphy, Dorahy & Adamson, 2007;Tien, 1991).', 'However, this difference may be mediated by depression (Tien, 1991).', 'In young adults (age 18-24), a similar tendency for women reporting higher levels of hallucinations has been found (Scott, Welham, Martin et al., 2008).', 'It is not clear exactly when this tendency emerges due to few studies focusing on auditory hallucinations in adolescence.', 'Kelleher et al.

The persistent trajectory was associated strongly with cannabis use, childhood trauma, developmental problems and ethnic minority status, and consistently displayed strong associations with factors known to predict transition from subclinical psychotic experience to clinical psychotic disorder (severity of and secondary distress due to psychotic experiences, social and attentional problems and affective dysregulation) and also with high levels of parental-reported psychotic experiences and use of mental health care at the end of the follow-up period.

Prevalence rates of AVH vary according to measurement tool and indicate a continuum of experience in the general population. Cross-sectional comparisons of individuals with AVH with and without need for care reveal similarities in phenomenology and some underlying mechanisms but also highlight key differences in emotional valence of AVH, appraisals, and behavioral response. Longitudinal studies suggest that AVH are an antecedent of clinical disorders when combined with negative emotional states, specific cognitive difficulties and poor coping, plus family history of psychosis, and environmental exposures such as childhood adversity. However, their predictive value for specific psychiatric disorders is not entirely clear.

Craig"", ""Stephanie J. Forkel"", ""Richard Kanaan"", ""Marco Picchioni"", ""Timothea Toulopoulou"", ""Sukhwinder Shergill"", ""Steve Williams"", ""Declan G. Murphy"", ""Philip McGuire""]","Background: Functional neuroimaging supports the hypothesis that auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) in schizophrenia result from altered functional connectivity between perisylvian language regions, although the extent to which AVH are also associated with an altered tract anatomy is less clear. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with schizophrenia subdivided into 17 subjects with a history of AVH and 11 without a history of hallucinations and 59 age- and IQ-matched healthy controls were recruited. The number of streamlines, fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity were measured along the length of the arcuate fasciculus and its medial and lateral components. Results: Patients with schizophrenia had bilateral reduction of FA relative to controls in the arcuate fasciculi (p < .001). Virtual dissection of the subcomponents of the arcuate fasciculi revealed that these reductions were specific to connections between posterior temporal and anterior regions in the inferior frontal and parietal lobe. Also, compared with controls, the reduction in FA of these tracts was highest, and bilateral, in patients with AVH, but in patients without AVH, this reduction was reported only on the left. Conclusions: These findings point toward a supraregional network model of AVH in schizophrenia. They support the hypothesis that there may be selective vulnerability of specific anatomical connections to posterior temporal regions in schizophrenia and that extensive bilateral damage is associated with a greater vulnerability to AVH. If confirmed by further studies, these findings may advance our understanding of the anatomical factors that are protective against AVH and predictive of a treatment response.","Also, the developmental trajectories of language networks in the brain, implicated in the neural basis of AVH (#AUTHOR_TAG, Craig, Forkel et al., 2011), differ between adolescent boys and girls (Hirnstein, Westerhausen, Korsnes & Hugdahl, 2013).","['In addition to age, there are other variables that may affect the frequency of reporting AVH.', 'In clinical samples, rates of auditory hallucinations have been suggested to be higher in female patients (Rector & Seeman, 1992;Sharma, Dowd & Janicak, 1999), although there are many confounding variables which may account for apparent gender differences (e.g., sampling biases, comorbid depression, etc.).', 'In general non-clinical populations, women have been found to have higher incidence of positive psychotic symptoms (Maric, Krabbendam, Vollebergh, de Graaf & Van Os, 2003), and specifically auditory hallucinations (Shevlin, Murphy, Dorahy & Adamson, 2007;Tien, 1991).', 'However, this difference may be mediated by depression (Tien, 1991).', 'In young adults (age 18-24), a similar tendency for women reporting higher levels of hallucinations has been found (Scott, Welham, Martin et al., 2008).', 'It is not clear exactly when this tendency emerges due to few studies focusing on auditory hallucinations in adolescence.', 'Kelleher et al.

CC1895,30816019,Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from a population-based study,Kristiina Kompus,"A comprehensive review of auditory verbal hallucinations: lifetime prevalence, correlates and mechanisms in healthy and clinical individuals","[""Saskia de Leede-Smith"", ""Emma Barkus""]","Over the years, the prevalence of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) have been documented across the lifespan in varied contexts, and with a range of potential long-term outcomes. Initially the emphasis focused on whether AVHs conferred risk for psychosis. However, recent research has identified significant differences in the presentation and outcomes of AVH in patients compared to those in non-clinical populations. For this reason, it has been suggested that auditory hallucinations are an entity by themselves and not necessarily indicative of transition along the psychosis continuum. This review will examine the presentation of auditory hallucinations across the life span, as well as in various clinical groups. The stages described include childhood, adolescence, adult non-clinical populations, hypnagogic/hypnopompic experiences, high schizotypal traits, schizophrenia, substance induced AVH, AVH in epilepsy, and AVH in the elderly. In children, need for care depends upon whether the child associates the voice with negative beliefs, appraisals and other symptoms of psychosis. This theme appears to carry right through to healthy voice hearers in adulthood, in which a negative impact of the voice usually only exists if the individual has negative experiences as a result of their voice(s). This includes features of the voices such as the negative content, frequency, and emotional valence as well as anxiety and depression, independently or caused by voices presence. It seems possible that the mechanisms which maintain AVH in non-clinical populations are different from those which are behind AVH presentations in psychotic illness. For example, the existence of maladaptive coping strategies in patient populations is one significant difference between clinical and non-clinical groups which is associated with a need for care. Whether or not these mechanisms start out the same and have differential trajectories is not yet evidenced. Future research needs to focus on the comparison of underlying factors and mechanisms that lead to the onset of AVH in both patient and non-clinical populations.","Furthermore, childhood trauma and childhood sexual abuse is more often experienced by females (Janssen et al., 2004;Molnar et al., 2001) and is also one of the strongest risk factors for developing clinically impairing AVH and psychotic symptoms (Daalman et al., 2012;#AUTHOR_TAG & Barkus, 2013;Janssen et al., 2004).","['Contrary to our expectations and previous studies, we found no gender differences in the rate of youth reporting hearing a voice speak their thoughts aloud, but there was a small gender difference in being likely to report being troubled by the voices, with female responders reporting to be more frequently troubled by voices than males (OR = 1.3).', 'Although the effect size is small, this finding deserves attention in further studies.', 'The slightly increased risk for being troubled by voices for female respondents, with no difference in the overall report of hearing voices, suggests that the voices may be experienced as more distressing by young women than their male peers.', 'Factor analyses of the LSHS have shown that while both of the items used in the present study load on an underlying ""auditory hallucinations"" factor (Lar͙i & Van Der Linden, 2005;Preti, Sisti, Rocchi et al., 2014), the item addressing being troubled by the voices has also been found to load on a factor associated with psychopathology (Aleman, Nieuwenstein, B__� ocker & De Haan, 2001;Waters, Badcock & Maybery, 2003), and has been associated with higher degree of negative emotionality (Lar͙i & Van Der Linden, 2005).', 'The persistence-impairment model suggested by Van Os et al.

Hallucinations at T0 were associated with increased levels of depressed mood and general psychopathology at T1, and the degree of persistence of hallucinations was associated with a progressively greater risk for T1 delusional ideation as well as increased levels of follow-up depressed mood and general psychopathology.Although hallucinations in adolescents are a common and mainly transitory phenomenon, the persistence rate over time is far from negligible, and associated with clinical deterioration.Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Over the years we have collected data from a vast number of participants using the same consonant-vowel dichotic listening task, a reliable marker for language lateralization. One dataset comprised behavioral data from 1782 participants (885 females, 125 non-right-handers), who were divided in four age groups (children 50 yrs). In addition, we had behavioral and functional imaging (fMRI) data from another 104 younger adults (49 females, aged 18-45 yrs), who completed the same dichotic listening task in a 3T scanner. This database allowed us to comprehensively test whether there is a sex difference in functional language lateralization. Across all participants and in both datasets a right ear advantage (REA) emerged, reflecting left-hemispheric language lateralization. Accordingly, the fMRI data revealed a leftward asymmetry in superior temporal lobe language processing areas. In the N = 1782 dataset no main effect of sex but a significant sex by age interaction emerged: the REA increased with age in both sexes but as a result of an earlier onset in females the REA was stronger in female than male adolescents. In turn, male younger adults showed greater asymmetry than female younger adults (accounting for <1% of variance). There were no sex differences in children and older adults. The males in the fMRI dataset (N = 104) also had a greater REA than females (accounting for 4% of variance), but no sex difference emerged in the neuroimaging data. Handedness did not affect these findings.

This reagent was synthesized by converting the cyano group of N-methyl-N-cyanoethyl-4-aminobenzaldehyde to a carboxylic acid, followed by conjugation with biotin pentyl-amine. Derivatization of peptides from bone collagen both stabilized the pyrroles and facilitated selective isolation of the pyrrole-containing peptides using a monomeric avidin column. Reactivity of the biotinylated reagent with collagen peptides was similar to that of the standard Ehrlich reagent, but heat denaturation of the tissue before enzyme digestion resulted in the loss of about 50% of the pyrrole cross-links. Identification of a series of peptides by mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of derivatized pyrrole structures combined with between 1 and 16 amino acid residues. Almost all of the pyrrole-containing peptides appeared to be derived from N-terminal telopeptide sequences, and the nonhydroxylated (lysine-derived) form predominated over pyrrole cross-links derived from helical hydroxylysine.","This paper describes a proteomic technique to identify serum proteins susceptible to oxidative and glycation damage using a modified Ehrlich's reagent, first used to investigate pyrrole cross-links in bone collagen #AUTHOR_TAG.","[""Pyrroles in proteins can be measured spectophotometrically using Ehrlich's reagent (pdimethylamino benzaldehyde) [7]."", 'This method has been used to detect pyrroles in tail tendon collagen of streptozotocin-diabetic rats [8;9] and in human plasma proteins following treatment with hydrogen peroxide [10] but these assays lack sufficient sensitivity for wide application.', ""This paper describes a proteomic technique to identify serum proteins susceptible to oxidative and glycation damage using a modified Ehrlich's reagent, first used to investigate pyrrole cross-links in bone collagen #AUTHOR_TAG."", 'The application of this methodology will aid in the discovery of novel biomarkers and further the aim of developing specific assays to monitor health status.']",5,"[""This paper describes a proteomic technique to identify serum proteins susceptible to oxidative and glycation damage using a modified Ehrlich's reagent, first used to investigate pyrrole cross-links in bone collagen #AUTHOR_TAG.""]"

Both include a whole network of different reactions in which an extraordinarily complex mixture of compounds is produced in very different amounts, with both positive and negative consequences. In addition, both reactions are intimately interrelated, and the products of each reaction influence the other. Furthermore, there are common intermediates and products in both pathways; these products are usually known as advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and advanced lipoxidation end products (ALEs). Moreover, other AGE/ALEs are analogous and participate similarly in both amino acid degradation and amino phospholipid/protein polymerization by identical mechanisms. All these data suggest that the Maillard reaction and lipid peroxidation are so closely interrelated that both reactions should be considered simultaneously to understand the reaction mechanisms, kinetics, and products in the complex mixtures of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins occurring in biochemical systems. In these systems, lipids and carbohydrates are competing in the chemical modification of amino phospholipids and proteins. Therefore, although there are significant differences between the Maillard reaction and lipid peroxidation, many aspects of both reactions can be better understood if they are included in only one general carbonyl pathway that can be initiated by both lipids and carbohydrates.","Both the Maillard reaction and lipid peroxidation follow similar reaction pathways, producing carbonyl derivatives which then form advanced glycation end products (AGE) or advanced lipid peroxidation end products (ALE) by means of carbonyl-amine reactions and aldol condensations forming protein crosslinks #AUTHOR_TAG.","['Pyrroles are not present in newly-formed proteins but occur when lipid oxidation products such as 4,5-Epoxy-2-alkenals, e.g.', '4,5(E)-epoxy-2(E)-heptenal (EH) which is produced from oxidation of n __� 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, react with free amino groups such as lysine residues on proteins [1;2].', 'Sugars such as glucose can also react nonenzymaticly with free amino groups.', 'This non-enzymic glycosylation is known as the Maillard reaction and is well known in food science.', 'Both the Maillard reaction and lipid peroxidation follow similar reaction pathways, producing carbonyl derivatives which then form advanced glycation end products (AGE) or advanced lipid peroxidation end products (ALE) by means of carbonyl-amine reactions and aldol condensations forming protein crosslinks #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Pyrrole cross-links have been identified in long lived proteins such as lens crystallins and skin collagen and implicated in the stiffening of arteries and joints associated with aging [4;5].', 'Increased (carboxyalkyl) pyrrole immunoreactivity was detected in plasma from patients with renal failure and artherosclerosis compared with healthy volunteers [1].', 'AGE and ALE increasingly accumulate during aging and in chronic diseases [6], suggesting that detecting pyrroles in proteins should be a good way to develop biomarkers for early stage disease.']",0,"['Both the Maillard reaction and lipid peroxidation follow similar reaction pathways, producing carbonyl derivatives which then form advanced glycation end products (AGE) or advanced lipid peroxidation end products (ALE) by means of carbonyl-amine reactions and aldol condensations forming protein crosslinks #AUTHOR_TAG.']"

We studied the effects of a saturated fat diet supplemented with fish oil, trans10,cis12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), or elaidic acid on lipid and glucose metabolism and liver protein levels of APOE*3 Leiden transgenic mice, a model for lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis. Fish oil lowered plasma and liver cholesterol and triglycerides, plasma free fatty acids, and glucose but increased plasma insulin. CLA lowered plasma cholesterol but increased plasma and liver triglycerides, plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate, and insulin. Elaidic acid lowered plasma and liver cholesterol. Proteomics identified significant regulation of 65 cytosolic and 8-membrane proteins. Many of these proteins were related to lipid and glucose metabolism, and to oxidative stress. Principal component analysis revealed that fish oil had a major impact on cytosolic proteins, and elaidic acid on membrane proteins. Correlation analysis between physiological and protein data revealed novel clusters of correlated variables, among which a metabolic syndrome cluster.

These antibodies exhibit high structural selectivity (< 0.5% cross-reactivity) in competitive binding inhibition assays with the corresponding human serum albumin (HSA)-bound pyrroles. No cross-reactivity was detected for HSA-bound 2-pentylpyrrole, an epitope that is generated by a reaction of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) with protein lysyl residues. Oxidation of either arachidonic or linoleic acid in the presence of HSA produced an HNE-derived 2-pentylpyrrole epitope. However, only oxidation of linoleic acid formed HSA-bound CHP, while only oxidation of arachidonic acid generated HSA-bound CPP. Since ester hydrolysis with KOH markedly elevated levels of immunoreactive epitopes detected in oxidized LDL, the CAPs are presumably generated by reactions of oxidized cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, and phospholipids with LDL protein, and only some of these oxidized esters are hydrolyzed, e.g., by phospholipase activity associated with LDL. Protein-bound CHP immunoreactivity was detected in human plasma, and levels are significantly elevated in renal failure and atherosclerosis patients compared with healthy volunteers.

Although its presence in vivo as well as in in vitro incubations of proteins with sugars has been documented by immunochemical methods using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, its formation in proteins has recently been questioned by similar methodology. To clarify this issue, we investigated pyrraline formation in proteins following alkaline hydrolysis and quantitation by high-performance liquid chromatography on a C18 reverse-phase column. Time- and sugar concentration-dependent increase in pyrraline formation was noted in serum albumin incubated with either 100 mM glucose or 50 mM 3-deoxyglucosone. Formation of pyrraline from 3-deoxyglucosone was rapid at slightly acidic pH, confirming its synthetic pathway through this Maillard reaction intermediate. Low levels of pyrraline (< 10 pmol/mg protein) were also detected in a pool of human skin collagen by this method, but no age effect was apparent. Using a slightly different approach, pyrraline-like material was detected in human plasma proteins following enzyme digestion and analysis by high performance liquid chromatography. Plasma from diabetic patients showed a significant increase in pyrraline-like material compared to controls. The levels in diabetic and normal individuals were 21.6 +/- 9.56 and 12.8 +/- 5.6 pmol per mg protein, respectively (P = 0.005), reflecting thereby the elevated levels of the immediate precursor of pyrraline, 3-deoxyglucosone, in diabetic plasma.",The initial stages of many glycation reactions are also mediated by pyrrole intermediates #AUTHOR_TAG and these may progress further to AGE products that may constitute cross-links within and between proteins.,"['The initial stages of many glycation reactions are also mediated by pyrrole intermediates #AUTHOR_TAG and these may progress further to AGE products that may constitute cross-links within and between proteins.', 'In the present study, the mechanisms of pyrrole formation in the isolated components have not yet been investigated, although further examination by mass spectrometry and other techniques will be used in future to provide information on the sources of protein damage.']",0,['The initial stages of many glycation reactions are also mediated by pyrrole intermediates #AUTHOR_TAG and these may progress further to AGE products that may constitute cross-links within and between proteins.']

The procedure consisted of the treatment of the modified protein with p-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde at a controlled acidity and temperature, and the determination of adducts produced against the blank obtained in the absence of the reagent. The extinction coefficient of Ehrlich adducts was calculated by using epsilon-N-pyrrolylnorleucine (Pnl) as standard and was 35,000 M-1 cm-1. The response was linear and reproducible within the range 0. 16-20 microM Pnl. The assay was applied to determination of pyrrole content in bovine serum albumin, bovine alpha-globulins, bovine gamma-globulins, and mixtures of them, incubated overnight with 1 mM of 4,5(E)-epoxy-2(E)-heptenal, obtaining results similar to those from determination of Pnl by capillary electrophoresis after basic hydrolysis of the protein. The method was also applied to pyrrole determination in bovine plasma proteins either incubated with epoxyalkenals, hydroxyalkenals, lipid hydroperoxides, and secondary products of lipid peroxidation, or oxidized with Fe3+/ascorbate. All these treatments produced pyrrolization of plasma proteins and all Ehrlich adducts gave very similar absorbance spectra with the exception of that produced in the treatment with hydroxyalkenals. The above results suggest that protein pyrrolization is a normal consequence of the lipid peroxidation process and of oxidative stress, and that Ehrlich adducts may be valid to determine this pyrrolization.Copyright 1998 Academic Press.",Pyrroles in proteins can be measured spectophotometrically using Ehrlich's reagent (pdimethylamino benzaldehyde) #AUTHOR_TAG.,"[""Pyrroles in proteins can be measured spectophotometrically using Ehrlich's reagent (pdimethylamino benzaldehyde) #AUTHOR_TAG."", 'This method has been used to detect pyrroles in tail tendon collagen of streptozotocin-diabetic rats [8;9] and in human plasma proteins following treatment with hydrogen peroxide [10] but these assays lack sufficient sensitivity for wide application.', ""This paper describes a proteomic technique to identify serum proteins susceptible to oxidative and glycation damage using a modified Ehrlich's reagent, first used to investigate pyrrole cross-links in bone collagen [11]."", 'The application of this methodology will aid in the discovery of novel biomarkers and further the aim of developing specific assays to monitor health status.']",0,"[""Pyrroles in proteins can be measured spectophotometrically using Ehrlich's reagent (pdimethylamino benzaldehyde) #AUTHOR_TAG.""]"

Mass spectrometric (MALDI-TOF-MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS) studies have been performed following incubation of the model protein beta-lactoglobulin with LA, Fe(II), and ascorbate, which identified adducts of these electrophiles with three different protein nucleophiles. Deuterium labeled linoleic acid 17,17,18,18,18-d(5)-(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic acid (d(5)-LA) was synthesized to facilitate the detection and characterization of the protein modifications by mass spectrometry. Reduction by NaBH(4) served to trap reversible adducts and to quantify the number of reducible functional groups in each adduct. This study, which mimics the distribution of reactive lipid peroxidation products generated by a continuous low level flux of reactive oxygen species present in vivo under conditions of oxidative stress, confirms that many irreversibly formed adducts previously identified following exposure of model proteins to pure electrophilic modifiers such as HNE and ONE are also generated during in situ oxidation of LA. These adducts include HNE-His Michael adducts (MA), ONE-Lys 4-ketoamide, ONE-Lys pyrrolinone, and a Cys/His-ONE-Lys pyrrole cross-link. However, reversibly formed adducts, such as the HNE-Lys Schiff base, are not present at detectable levels. The isotopic labeling allowed less commonly identified mirror-image adducts derived from the carboxy terminus of LA to be identified.

Thus, we studied the non-enzymic glycation of several major plasma proteins and plasma protein fractions in normal and diabetic patients. In vivo glycation for most plasma proteins was very low in non-diabetic patients, only gamma globulin showing more than 5% glycation. In diabetic plasmas, glycation was much greater, immunoglobulins again showing the greatest proportion, followed in descending order by albumin, complement C3, fibrinogen, transferrin, haptoglobin, and alpha-1-antitrypsin. When plasma proteins were glycated in vitro, this order was IgG greater than complement C3 greater than albumin greater than transferrin greater than haptoglobin greater than alpha-1-antitrypsin. In general, proteins with the longest biological half-lives, such as IgG and albumin, showed the greatest in vivo glycation.

However, it has also often been reported that languages can sometimes distinguish more than three tenses. Such languages appear to have 'graded tense' systems, where the tense morphology serves to track how far into the past or future a reported event occurs. This paper presents a formal semantic analysis of the tense-aspect system of Gikuyu  (Kikuyu), a Northeastern Bantu language of Kenya. Like many languages of the Bantu family, Gikuyu  appears to exhibit a graded tense system, wherein four grades of past tense and three grades of future tense are distinguished. I argue that the prefixes traditionally labeled as 'tenses ' in Gikuyu exhibit important differences from (and similarities to) tenses in languages like English. Although, like tenses in English, these 'temporal remoteness prefixes ' in Gikuyu  introduce presuppositions regarding a temporal parameter of the clause, in Gikuyu  these presuppositions concern the 'event time ' of the clause directly, rather than the 'topic time'. Consequently, the key difference between Gikuyu  and lan-guages like English lies not in how many tenses are distinguished, but in whether tense-like features are able to modify other, lower verbal functional projections in the clause","An alternative view differentiates between processing routes on the basis of word form morphology (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1999;Pinker & Ullman, 2002;Ullman, 2001;Ullman et al., 1997).","['An alternative view differentiates between processing routes on the basis of word form morphology (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1999;Pinker & Ullman, 2002;Ullman, 2001;Ullman et al., 1997).', 'This view maintains that regular inflection is the predictable form, which can be applied to novel word forms and invokes a combinatory rule (e.g.', 'English past tense regular form rule: stem + -ed; e.g.', 'print-ed).', 'Conversely, irregular inflections are stored forms that cannot be predicted by the form of the stem, and cannot be applied to novel word forms (e.g.', 'meet; met).', 'This view assumes that the dual model uses an associative system which depends on declarative memory.', 'It also includes a combinatorial system that depends on rules to formulate multi-morphemic word forms.', 'It maintains that the lexicon is a subdivision of memory and that irregular forms are stored in memory.', 'However, grammar is a productive and combinatorial system that carries out operations that assemble morphemes into word forms.', 'The associative system generalizes on the basis of resemblance to stored examples, while the combinatorial system suppresses differences between items, and treats members of a morpho-syntactic category equally.']",0,"['An alternative view differentiates between processing routes on the basis of word form morphology (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1999;Pinker & Ullman, 2002;Ullman, 2001;Ullman et al., 1997).', 'This view maintains that regular inflection is the predictable form, which can be applied to novel word forms and invokes a combinatory rule (e.g.', 'English past tense regular form rule: stem + -ed; e.g.', 'print-ed).']"

The left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG, including Broca's area) is often implicated as being involved, although its specific role is unclear. Data from brain damaged individuals, particularly those with Broca's aphasia, are often used as evidence to support or refute various theoretical perspectives. Typically, performance on two types of morphologically complex verbs, regulars (walk-walked, slip-slipped) and irregulars (sing-sang, sleep-slept) is contrasted for evidence of single or double dissociations. The question of how Broca's aphasic individuals dissociate in their production of inflectional morphology is important to our understanding of how the brain is organized to compute morphologically complex words. This article is a synthesis of research studies investigating the production of morphologically complex regular and irregular verbs in individuals with Broca's aphasia. The question being asked is if there is a robust and consistent dissociation, and if this dissociation can be tied to lesions of the left frontal lobe. This meta-analysis of 75 patients failed to show a single consistent dissociation pattern and over half the datasets had no significant difference between regulars and irregulars. There was also no relationship of any performance pattern to frontal lobe lesions, highlighting the difficulty of identifying any single neuroanatomical lesion for regular-irregular verb production deficits. The implications for various theoretical and neuroanatomical hypotheses are discussed. The role of neuropsychological dissociations in constraining hypothesis of normal neuroanatomical organization is evaluated.","In her study of regular and irregular morpho-syntax in English, #AUTHOR_TAG (2007) concluded that models which propose differences in processing regular and irregular morpho-syntax fail to account for the whole spectrum of regular morphology.","['In her study of regular and irregular morpho-syntax in English, #AUTHOR_TAG (2007) concluded that models which propose differences in processing regular and irregular morpho-syntax fail to account for the whole spectrum of regular morphology.', 'She argued that models which make a binary distinction between regular and irregular forms based on past tense morphology fail to account for the presence of preserved progressive ing or plural s in the absence of regular morphology in the past tense (such as participants reported in Friedmann and Grodzinsky, 1997) suggesting that the dissociation is not a result of differential processing of regular and irregular morphology.', 'Faroqi-Shah (2007) stated that a dissociation between regular and irregular morphosyntax could be a result of phonological similarities and differences rather than morphological features.', 'She argued that English regular past tense verbs have similar phonological endings while irregulars do not.', 'Therefore, a phonological effect could be present; for example a length effect could result in dropping the ed in regular past tenses.', 'In the current dataset, Arabic data gave insight into this issue which English data fail to do.', 'The regular form of Arabic plural nouns has four different suffixes depending on gender and number (dual masculine: /-e n/; dual feminine: /-te n/; plural masculine: /n/; plural feminine: /-aet/), unlike the English past tense which has one regular ending (ed).', 'Unlike English regular suffixes, Arabic regular suffixes are phonologically distinct, yet a dissociation between regular and irregular formations was found.', 'This finding supports the claim that differential processing between regular and irregular morphologies was present and cannot be reduced to phonological similarities as proposed by Faroqi-Shah ( 2007), due to the phonological distinctiveness of suffixes in Arabic.']",1,"['In her study of regular and irregular morpho-syntax in English, #AUTHOR_TAG (2007) concluded that models which propose differences in processing regular and irregular morpho-syntax fail to account for the whole spectrum of regular morphology.']"

An alternative account based on a parallel-distributed processing approach proposes that one complex procedure processes all past-tense types. In this alternative view, neuropsychological dissociations are explained by reduced input from word meaning that plays a greater role in successful generation of the past-tense for lower frequency irregular verbs, and by phonological deficits that disproportionately affect regular and novel forms. Only limited evidence has been available concerning the relationship between knowledge of word meaning and verb-tense processing. The study reported here evaluated the past-tense verb abilities of 11 patients with semantic dementia, a neurodegenerative condition characterised by degraded semantic knowledge. We predicted and confirmed that the patients would have essentially normal ability to generate and recognise regular (and novel) past-tense forms, but a marked and frequency-modulated deficit on irregular verbs.

These volumes by a pioneering neurocomputing group suggest that the answer lies in the massively parallel architecture of the human mind. They describe a new theory of cognition called connectionism that is challenging the idea of symbolic computation that has traditionally been at the center of debate in theoretical discussions about the mind. The authors' theory assumes the mind is composed of a great number of elementary units connected in a neural network. Mental processes are interactions between these units which excite and inhibit each other in parallel rather than sequential operations. In this context, knowledge can no longer be thought of as stored in localized structures; instead, it consists of the connections between pairs of units that are distributed throughout the network. Volume 1 lays the foundations of this exciting theory of parallel distributed processing, while Volume 2 applies it to a number of specific issues in cognitive science and neuroscience, with chapters describing models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought.","The single mechanism account maintains that one mechanism governs production of both regular and irregular forms (Bird et al., 2003;Braber et al., 2005;Bybee, 1995;Joanisse and Seidenberg, 1999;Juola and Plunkett, 2000;Lambon Ralph et al., 2005;Marchman, 1993;Patterson et al., 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG and McClelland, 1986;Stockall, & Marantz, 2006;Yang, 2000).","['The single mechanism account maintains that one mechanism governs production of both regular and irregular forms (Bird et al., 2003;Braber et al., 2005;Bybee, 1995;Joanisse and Seidenberg, 1999;Juola and Plunkett, 2000;Lambon Ralph et al., 2005;Marchman, 1993;Patterson et al., 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG and McClelland, 1986;Stockall, & Marantz, 2006;Yang, 2000).', 'While there are a number of different views within this family of models, our focus will be on Joanisse and Seidenberg (1999) who proposed a connectionist account based on computerized simulations of regular and irregular processing.', 'This view is based on the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) model (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986).', 'The connectionist perspective maintains that both forms are computed by a single mechanism, which is not rule-based as this is not necessary for formulation of regular forms.', 'Instead, the processing of regular and irregular forms is governed by two types of lexical information i.e. semantic and phonological.', 'According to Joanisse and Seidenberg (1999), an impairment in production of regular forms results from a phonological deficit but a deficit in irregular forms results from a semantic deficit.', 'They assume that semantic knowledge has an impact on irregular word forms.', 'They stipulate that the semantic system retrieves specific idiosyncratic forms of verbs.', 'For example generating the past E D tation of this T phonologically similar word form -P ology has an impact on regular and novel word forms.', 'It applies analogies to word forms which undergo similar phonological processes (such as adding the English past tense verb suffix -ed).', 'For example, a novel word form such as no semantic reference) but its past tense can be generated using a phonological analogy.', 'A deficit in phonology affects such processes.']",0,"['The single mechanism account maintains that one mechanism governs production of both regular and irregular forms (Bird et al., 2003;Braber et al., 2005;Bybee, 1995;Joanisse and Seidenberg, 1999;Juola and Plunkett, 2000;Lambon Ralph et al., 2005;Marchman, 1993;Patterson et al., 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG and McClelland, 1986;Stockall, & Marantz, 2006;Yang, 2000).', 'While there are a number of different views within this family of models, our focus will be on Joanisse and Seidenberg (1999) who proposed a connectionist account based on computerized simulations of regular and irregular processing.', 'This view is based on the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) model (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986).', 'The connectionist perspective maintains that both forms are computed by a single mechanism, which is not rule-based as this is not necessary for formulation of regular forms.', 'Instead, the processing of regular and irregular forms is governed by two types of lexical information i.e. semantic and phonological.']"

A semantics for the dual and sound plural is given in which the number morpheme, located in the functional head Num, maps a set of atoms onto a set of sums. It is argued that the broken plural can denote either a set of sums or a set of groups, accounting for its distributive and collective readings, reflected in the agreement on the verb. I consider the class of collective nouns in Arabic, which are non-singular but have a marked singular form, called the singulative. I argue that the collective is underlyingly non-generic, with the same semantics as nouns like furniture in English, denoting a semilattice, which contains atoms as well as sums. The singulative is analysed as a classifier which maps the semilattice onto a set of atoms.

This evidence comes mostly from psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics and lexical studies. Most of these studies have concluded that the mental lexicon of Semitic decomposes words into consonantal roots combined with other morphological units. While some studies in formal linguistics have also reached this conclusion on the basis of internal evidence, others have argued that Semitic roots must contain both consonants and vowels. This article reviews the theoretical and empirical motivations behind these two conclusions. It is proposed that i) convergences between external and internal types of evidence are theoretically significant, and ii) such convergences currently favor formal models of morphology that regard the consonantal root as a legitimate morphological unit in Semitic languages.","Most roots in Arabic are made up of three consonants which are referred to as triliteral roots or consonantal roots (Zabbal, 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2006).","['(1) /w r g-te n/ [FEMININE DUAL NOUN Broken plurals are formed by stem change in the vocalic pattern of the noun.', 'This process is dependent on two morphological phenomena: the vocalic patterns of broken plurals and the consonantal roots.', 'Lexical items of Arabic origin consist of a consonantal root which is a string of consonants.', 'Most roots in Arabic are made up of three consonants which are referred to as triliteral roots or consonantal roots (Zabbal, 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2006).', 'A root can be notated as C1 C2 C3.', 'Roots are combined with vowels that embed themselves between root consonants to form a lexical item.', 'The meaning of a given lexical item can be changed by changing the vowel pattern within the word form.', ""For example, the word form /k t b / meaning 'he wrote' is derived from the consonantal root /ktb/ which is the triliteral root for word forms derived from these three consonants."", ""The same triliteral root /ktb/ is used with a change of vowels for the word form /k taeb / meaning 'writing'."", 'Previous literature (Soudi et al., 2002;Zabbal, 2002;Prunet, 2006) has stated that broken plurals are formed in a three stage process.', ""For the sake of describing this process, the singular noun /r l/ 'man' will be used as an example through the three stages of broken pluralisation process."", 'Stage one: the root from the underlying singular noun is selected.', 'Stage two: the broken plural pattern i.e. vocalic pattern is selected.', 'Stage three: the selected root is merged with the selected vocalic pattern to form the broken plural of the singular noun /r l/ , to become /r :l/ .']",0,"['Most roots in Arabic are made up of three consonants which are referred to as triliteral roots or consonantal roots (Zabbal, 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2006).', 'A root can be notated as C1 C2 C3.', 'Roots are combined with vowels that embed themselves between root consonants to form a lexical item.', 'The meaning of a given lexical item can be changed by changing the vowel pattern within the word form.', ""For example, the word form /k t b / meaning 'he wrote' is derived from the consonantal root /ktb/ which is the triliteral root for word forms derived from these three consonants.""]"

The interpretation given was that a generalised phonological impairment was central to the patients' language deficits, including their poor performance on regular past tense verbs. The current paper provides further evidence in favour of this hypothesis, on the basis of a detailed analysis of the errors produced by these same 10 patients in reading, repetition, and sentence completion for a large number of regular, irregular, and nonce verbs. The patients' predominant error types in all tasks and for all verb types were close and distant phonologically related responses. The balance between close and distant errors varied along three continua: the severity of the patient (more distant errors produced by the more severely impaired patients); the difficulty of the task (more distant errors in sentence completion>reading>repetition); the difficulty of the item (more distant errors for novel word forms than real verbs). A position analysis for these phonologically related errors revealed that vowels were most likely to be preserved and that consonant onsets and offsets were equally likely to be incorrect. Critically, the patients' errors exhibited a strong tendency to simplify the phonological form of the target. These results are consistent with the notion that the patients' relatively greater difficulty with regular past tenses reflects a phonological impairment that is sensitive to the complexity of spoken forms.","The single mechanism account maintains that one mechanism governs production of both regular and irregular forms (Bird et al., 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005;Bybee, 1995;Joanisse and Seidenberg, 1999;Juola and Plunkett, 2000;Lambon Ralph et al., 2005;Marchman, 1993;Patterson et al., 2001;Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986;Stockall, & Marantz, 2006;Yang, 2000).","['The single mechanism account maintains that one mechanism governs production of both regular and irregular forms (Bird et al., 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005;Bybee, 1995;Joanisse and Seidenberg, 1999;Juola and Plunkett, 2000;Lambon Ralph et al., 2005;Marchman, 1993;Patterson et al., 2001;Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986;Stockall, & Marantz, 2006;Yang, 2000).', 'While there are a number of different views within this family of models, our focus will be on Joanisse and Seidenberg (1999) who proposed a connectionist account based on computerized simulations of regular and irregular processing.', 'This view is based on the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) model (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986).', 'The connectionist perspective maintains that both forms are computed by a single mechanism, which is not rule-based as this is not necessary for formulation of regular forms.', 'Instead, the processing of regular and irregular forms is governed by two types of lexical information i.e. semantic and phonological.', 'According to Joanisse and Seidenberg (1999), an impairment in production of regular forms results from a phonological deficit but a deficit in irregular forms results from a semantic deficit.', 'They assume that semantic knowledge has an impact on irregular word forms.', 'They stipulate that the semantic system retrieves specific idiosyncratic forms of verbs.', 'For example generating the past E D tation of this T phonologically similar word form -P ology has an impact on regular and novel word forms.', 'It applies analogies to word forms which undergo similar phonological processes (such as adding the English past tense verb suffix -ed).', 'For example, a novel word form such as no semantic reference) but its past tense can be generated using a phonological analogy.', 'A deficit in phonology affects such processes.']",1,"['The single mechanism account maintains that one mechanism governs production of both regular and irregular forms (Bird et al., 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005;Bybee, 1995;Joanisse and Seidenberg, 1999;Juola and Plunkett, 2000;Lambon Ralph et al., 2005;Marchman, 1993;Patterson et al., 2001;Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986;Stockall, & Marantz, 2006;Yang, 2000).']"

From a biological perspective, the development of language, as the development of any other organic systems, is an interaction between internal and external factors; specifically, between the child's internal knowledge of linguistic structures and the external linguistic experience he receives. Drawing insights from the study of biological evolution, we put forth a quantitative model of language acquisition that make this interaction precise, by embedding a theory of knowledge, the Universal Grammar, into a theory of learning from experience. In particular, we advance the idea that language acquisition should be modeled as a population of grammatical hypotheses, competing to match the external linguistic experiences, much like in a natural selection process. We present evidenceÑconceptual, mathematical, and empirical, and from a number of independent areas of linguistic research, including the acquisition of syntax and morphophology, and historical language changeÑto demonstrate the model's correctness and utility.","The single mechanism account maintains that one mechanism governs production of both regular and irregular forms (Bird et al., 2003;Braber et al., 2005;Bybee, 1995;Joanisse and Seidenberg, 1999;Juola and Plunkett, 2000;Lambon Ralph et al., 2005;Marchman, 1993;Patterson et al., 2001;Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986;Stockall, & Marantz, 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2000).","['The single mechanism account maintains that one mechanism governs production of both regular and irregular forms (Bird et al., 2003;Braber et al., 2005;Bybee, 1995;Joanisse and Seidenberg, 1999;Juola and Plunkett, 2000;Lambon Ralph et al., 2005;Marchman, 1993;Patterson et al., 2001;Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986;Stockall, & Marantz, 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2000).', 'While there are a number of different views within this family of models, our focus will be on Joanisse and Seidenberg (1999) who proposed a connectionist account based on computerized simulations of regular and irregular processing.', 'This view is based on the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) model (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986).', 'The connectionist perspective maintains that both forms are computed by a single mechanism, which is not rule-based as this is not necessary for formulation of regular forms.', 'Instead, the processing of regular and irregular forms is governed by two types of lexical information i.e. semantic and phonological.', 'According to Joanisse and Seidenberg (1999), an impairment in production of regular forms results from a phonological deficit but a deficit in irregular forms results from a semantic deficit.', 'They assume that semantic knowledge has an impact on irregular word forms.', 'They stipulate that the semantic system retrieves specific idiosyncratic forms of verbs.', 'For example generating the past E D tation of this T phonologically similar word form -P ology has an impact on regular and novel word forms.', 'It applies analogies to word forms which undergo similar phonological processes (such as adding the English past tense verb suffix -ed).', 'For example, a novel word form such as no semantic reference) but its past tense can be generated using a phonological analogy.', 'A deficit in phonology affects such processes.']",0,"['The single mechanism account maintains that one mechanism governs production of both regular and irregular forms (Bird et al., 2003;Braber et al., 2005;Bybee, 1995;Joanisse and Seidenberg, 1999;Juola and Plunkett, 2000;Lambon Ralph et al., 2005;Marchman, 1993;Patterson et al., 2001;Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986;Stockall, & Marantz, 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2000).']"

When networks were trained only on phonological encodings of stem-suhed pairs similar to English regular verbs (e.g., walk 3 wulkd), long-term deficits (i.e., ""critical period "" effects) were not observed, yet there were substantive short-term effects of injury. When train-ing vocabulary reflected the English-like competition between regular (suffixed) and irregular verbs (e.g., go 3 went, hit 3 hit), the acquisition of regular verbs became increasingly sus-ceptible to injury, while the irregulars were learned quickly and were relatively impervious to damage. Patterns of gener-alization to novel forms conflicts with the assumption that this behavioral dissociation is indicative of selective impairment of the learning and generalization of the past tense rule, while the associative lexical-based mechanism is left intact.

In English, a large array of tools is available, while in most other languages, the selection is more limited. Importantly, assessment tools are often simple translations and do not take into consideration specific linguistic and psycholinguistic parameters of the target languages. As a first step in meeting the needs for comparable assessment tools, the Comprehensive Aphasia Test is currently being adapted into a number of languages spoken in Europe. In this article, some key challenges encountered in the adaptation process and the solutions to ensure that the resulting assessment tools are linguistically and culturally equivalent, are proposed. Specifically, we focus on challenges and solutions related to the use of imageability, frequency, word length, spelling-to-sound regularity and sentence length and complexity as underlying properties in the selection of the testing material.For the work reported in this article, we were supported by various funding bodies.

Conversely, pattern-associator accounts attribute both regular and irregular inflection to an associative process. The acquisition of the default is ascribed to the asymmetry in the distribution of regular and irregular tokens. Irregular tokens tend to form tight, well-defined phonological clusters (e.g. sing-sang, ring-rang), whereas regular forms are diffusely distributed throughout the phonological space. This distributional asymmetry is necessary and sufficient for the acquisition of a regular default. Hebrew nominal inflection challenges this account. We demonstrate that Hebrew speakers use the regular masculine inflection as a default despite the overlap in the distribution of regular and irregular Hebrew masculine nouns. Specifically, Experiment 1 demonstrates that regular inflection is productively applied to novel nouns regardless of their similarity to existing regular nouns. In contrast, the inflection of irregular sounding nouns is strongly sensitive to their similarity to stored irregular tokens. Experiment 2 establishes the generality of the regular default for novel words that are phonologically idiosyncratic. Experiment 3 demonstrates that Hebrew speakers assign the default regular inflection to borrowings and names that are identical to existing irregular nouns. The existence of default inflection in Hebrew is incompatible with the distributional asymmetry hypothesis. Our findings also lend no support for a type-frequency account. The convergence of the circumstances triggering default inflection in Hebrew, German and English suggests that the capacity for default inflection may be general.","Various studies have investigated different aspects of the dual and single mechanism frameworks (English: Braber, Patterson, Ellis and Lambon Ralph, 2005;Lambon Ralph, Braber, McClelland and Patterson, 2005;Miozzo, 2003;Patterson et al., 2001;German: Penke, Janssen andKrause, 1999: Hebrew: #AUTHOR_TAG, Pinker andShimron, 1999;Italian: Walenski, Katiuscia, Cappa and Ullman, 2009;Spanish and Catalan: Rodriguez-Fornells, Munte, and Clahsen 2002).","['Various studies have investigated different aspects of the dual and single mechanism frameworks (English: Braber, Patterson, Ellis and Lambon Ralph, 2005;Lambon Ralph, Braber, McClelland and Patterson, 2005;Miozzo, 2003;Patterson et al., 2001;German: Penke, Janssen andKrause, 1999: Hebrew: #AUTHOR_TAG, Pinker andShimron, 1999;Italian: Walenski, Katiuscia, Cappa and Ullman, 2009;Spanish and Catalan: Rodriguez-Fornells, Munte, and Clahsen 2002).', 'Support for both theoretical frameworks has been found.', 'While findings from these studies have confirmed certain aspects of a given model, they were inconsistent with other assumptions of the same model.', 'For example, deficient irregular inflections in agrammatic aphasia (reported in De Deigo Bulaguer et al. 2004) indicated that the dual mechanism approach does not account for all patterns of performance.', 'Moreover, irregular impairment in the presence of phonological deficit and absence of semantic deficit in, for example, AW (Miozzo, 2003) (Pinker and Ullman, 2002;Ullman et al., 1997).', 'The dual mechanism account assumes that the breakdown of regular forms is due to impaired rule-based processes linked to a general syntactic processing impairment underlying agrammatism.', 'De Deigo Bulaguer et al.

A fit of a third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state to the P-V data yields values of KT 0 = 177(4) GPa and . The evolution of the structure with pressure shows that compression of the LaO12 site is strongly anisotropic, with the three longest La-O bonds being more compressible than the other nine shorter La-O bond lengths. Consequently the distortion of the LaO12 site decreases with increasing pressure. The rotation angle around the threefold axis of the AlO6 octahedra is totally determined by the relative compressibilities of the La and Al sites, and decreases significantly with pressure. This variation leads to the rhombohedral to cubic phase transition. A new model, introduced to predict the high-pressure behaviour of the GdFeO3 (Pbnm)-type perovskites, is extended to rhombohedral perovskites in this paper. The model correctly predicts that the AlO6 site is more compressible than the LaO12 site in LaAlO3, and that the rhombohedral to cubic phase transition is controlled by the relative compressibilities of the two cation sites.","At ambient conditions, the rhombohedral cell has the lattice parameters a R = 5.357�� and �� R = 60.12 _�� , or in the hexagonal setting a H = 5.366�� and c H = 13.109�� #AUTHOR_TAG.","['Lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO 3 -LAO) is a prototype compound for soft-mode driven antiferrodistorsive phase transitions.', 'At ambient conditions, LAO crystallizes in the R3c space group, as a result of the condensation of a soft mode at the R point of the Brillouin zone boundary.', 'At ambient conditions, the rhombohedral cell has the lattice parameters a R = 5.357�� and �� R = 60.12 _�� , or in the hexagonal setting a H = 5.366�� and c H = 13.109�� #AUTHOR_TAG.', '[7].', 'In this structure, the oxygen octahedra are rotated along the [111] C direction of the parent cubic cell.', 'The rhombohedral distortion can be described by this single tilt angle.', 'Following early structural studies [8,9], the temperature-induced phase transition at 813 K has been studied in great details (e.g.', '[10] and references within).', 'On the theoretical side, the parameters of a Landau potential were fitted to available experimental data [11].', 'The pressure-induced rhombohedral to cubic transition of LAO was revealed by a powder Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron diffraction study [12].', 'It was at that time the first exception to the so-far general rule stating that tilt angles in antiferrodistorsive perovskites should increase under pressure [13].', 'This example has motivated theoretical work to explain this behaviour and formulate new rules and models to predict qualitatively and quantitavely the evolution of distortions (tilt angles) under pressure [14,15,16,17].', 'The evolution of the tilt angles in LAO itself was investigated by single crystal diffraction under hydrostatic stress up to 8 GPa [7] and non-hydrostatic stress [18].']",5,"['Lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO 3 -LAO) is a prototype compound for soft-mode driven antiferrodistorsive phase transitions.', 'At ambient conditions, LAO crystallizes in the R3c space group, as a result of the condensation of a soft mode at the R point of the Brillouin zone boundary.', 'At ambient conditions, the rhombohedral cell has the lattice parameters a R = 5.357�� and �� R = 60.12 _�� , or in the hexagonal setting a H = 5.366�� and c H = 13.109�� #AUTHOR_TAG.']"

CC1939,2193860,Structural investigation of LaAlO 3 up to 63 GPa,Mael Guennou,New view of the high-pressure behaviour of GdFeO3-type perovskites,"[""J. Zhao"", ""N. L. Ross"", ""R. J. Angel""]","Recent determinations of the structures of several GdFeO(3)-type orthorhombic perovskites (ABO(3)) show that the octahedra in some become more tilted with increasing pressure. In others the octahedra become less tilted and the structure evolves towards a higher-symmetry configuration. This variety of behaviour can be explained in terms of the relative compressibilities of the octahedral and dodecahedral cation sites in the perovskite structure. If the BO(6) octahedra are less compressible than the AO(12) sites then the perovskite will become more distorted with pressure, but the perovskite will become less distorted if the BO(6) site is more compressible than the AO(12) site. In this contribution we use the bond-valence concept to develop a model that predicts the relative compressibilities of the cation sites in oxide perovskites. We introduce the site parameter M(i) defined in terms of the coordination number N(i), average bond length at room pressure R(i), and the bond-valence parameters R(0) and B,M(i) = ([R(i)N(i)/B)exp](R(0) - R(i))/B].M(i) represents the variation in the bond-valence sum at the central cation in a polyhedral site because of the change of the average bond distance. Experimental data suggest that the pressure-induced changes in the bond-valence sums at the two cation sites within any given perovskite are equal. With this condition we show that the ratio of cation-site compressibilities is given by betaB/beta(A) = M(A)/M(B). This model, based only upon room-pressure bond lengths and bond-valence parameters, correctly predicts the structural behaviour and some physical properties of the oxide perovskites that have been measured at high pressure.","This example has motivated theoretical work to explain this behaviour and formulate new rules and models to predict qualitatively and quantitavely the evolution of distortions (tilt angles) under pressure [#AUTHOR_TAG,15,16,17].","['Lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO 3 -LAO) is a prototype compound for soft-mode driven antiferrodistorsive phase transitions.', 'At ambient conditions, LAO crystallizes in the R3c space group, as a result of the condensation of a soft mode at the R point of the Brillouin zone boundary.', 'At ambient conditions, the rhombohedral cell has the lattice parameters a R = 5.357�� and �� R = 60.12 _�� , or in the hexagonal setting a H = 5.366�� and c H = 13.109��', '[7].', 'In this structure, the oxygen octahedra are rotated along the [111] C direction of the parent cubic cell.', 'The rhombohedral distortion can be described by this single tilt angle.', 'Following early structural studies [8,9], the temperature-induced phase transition at 813 K has been studied in great details (e.g.', '[10] and references within).', 'On the theoretical side, the parameters of a Landau potential were fitted to available experimental data [11].', 'The pressure-induced rhombohedral to cubic transition of LAO was revealed by a powder Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron diffraction study [12].', 'It was at that time the first exception to the so-far general rule stating that tilt angles in antiferrodistorsive perovskites should increase under pressure [13].', 'This example has motivated theoretical work to explain this behaviour and formulate new rules and models to predict qualitatively and quantitavely the evolution of distortions (tilt angles) under pressure [#AUTHOR_TAG,15,16,17].', 'The evolution of the tilt angles in LAO itself was investigated by single crystal diffraction under hydrostatic stress up to 8 GPa [7] and non-hydrostatic stress [18].']",4,"['Lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO 3 -LAO) is a prototype compound for soft-mode driven antiferrodistorsive phase transitions.', 'This example has motivated theoretical work to explain this behaviour and formulate new rules and models to predict qualitatively and quantitavely the evolution of distortions (tilt angles) under pressure [#AUTHOR_TAG,15,16,17].', 'The evolution of the tilt angles in LAO itself was investigated by single crystal diffraction under hydrostatic stress up to 8 GPa [7] and non-hydrostatic stress [18].']"

Regehr"", ""Mustafa Sahin""]","Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders, but the underlying pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Recent studies have implicated the cerebellum in these disorders, with post-mortem studies in ASD patients showing cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) loss, and isolated cerebellar injury has been associated with a higher incidence of ASDs. However, the extent of cerebellar contribution to the pathogenesis of ASDs remains unclear. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder with high rates of comorbid ASDs that result from mutation of either TSC1 or TSC2, whose protein products dimerize and negatively regulate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. TSC is an intriguing model to investigate the cerebellar contribution to the underlying pathogenesis of ASDs, as recent studies in TSC patients demonstrate cerebellar pathology and correlate cerebellar pathology with increased ASD symptomatology. Functional imaging also shows that TSC patients with ASDs display hypermetabolism in deep cerebellar structures, compared to TSC patients without ASDs. However, the roles of Tsc1 and the sequelae of Tsc1 dysfunction in the cerebellum have not been investigated so far. Here we show that both heterozygous and homozygous loss of Tsc1 in mouse cerebellar PCs results in autistic-like behaviours, including abnormal social interaction, repetitive behaviour and vocalizations, in addition to decreased PC excitability.

These Tsc2f/_;Cre mice exhibit progressive Purkinje cell degeneration. Since loss of Purkinje cells is a well reported postmortem finding in patients with ASD, we conducted a series of behavior tests to asses if Tsc2f/_;Cre mice displayed autistic-like deficits. Tsc2f/_;Cre mice demonstrated increased repetitive behavior as assessed with marble burying activity. Using the three chambered apparatus to asses social behavior, we found that Tsc2f/_;Cre mice showed behavioral deficits, exhibiting no preference between a stranger mouse and an inanimate object, or between a novel and a familiar mouse. We also detected social deficits in Tsc2f/f;Cre mice, suggesting that Purkinje cell pathology is sufficient to induce ASD-like behavior. Importantly, social behavior deficits were prevented with rapamycin treatment. Altogether, these results demonstrate that loss of Tsc2 in Purkinje cells in a Tsc2-haploinsufficient background leads to autistic-like behavioral deficits. These studies provide compelling evidence that Purkinje cell loss and/or dysfunction may be an important link between TSC and ASD as well as a general anatomic phenomenon that contributes to the ASD phenotype.","Others have also provided evidence that autistic-like behavior can be prevented with mTOR treatment in mouse models of TSC (Tsai et al, 2012;Talos et al, 2012; #AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2013).","['Preclinical studies in animal models of TSC, however, have assessed the potential efficacy of mTOR-based treatment on TSC-related cognitive impairments.', 'In adult mice with a heterozygous, inactivating mutation in the TSC2 gene, mTOR inhibition reversed TSC-related learning and memory deficits.', 'These cognitive abnormalities emerged in the absence of neuropathology and seizures (Ehninger et al. 2008(Ehninger et al. , 2009.', 'A recent study by Sato et al.

We have tested rapamycin and RAD001 [40-O-(2-hydroxyethyl)-rapamycin], both mammalian target of rapamycin mTORC1 inhibitors, as potential therapeutic agents in this model. Median survival is improved from 33 d to more than 100 d; behavior, phenotype, and weight gain are all also markedly improved. There is brain penetration of both drugs, with accumulation over time with repetitive treatment, and effective reduction of levels of phospho-S6, a downstream target of mTORC1. In addition, there is restoration of phospho-Akt and phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3 levels in the treated mice, consistent with restoration of Akt function. Neurofilament abnormalities, myelination, and cell enlargement are all improved by the treatment. However, dysplastic neuronal features persist, and there are only modest changes in dendritic spine density and length. Strikingly, mice treated with rapamycin or RAD001 for 23 d only (postnatal days 7-30) displayed a persistent improvement in phenotype, with median survival of 78 d. In summary, rapamycin/RAD001 are highly effective therapies for this neuronal model of TSC, with benefit apparently attributable to effects on mTORC1 and Akt signaling and, consequently, cell size and myelination. Although caution is appropriate, the results suggest the possibility that rapamycin/RAD001 may have benefit in the treatment of TSC brain disease, including infantile spasms.","This suggests that at least some of the TSC-related cognitive impairments are caused by disinhibited mTOR signaling in adults, and are the consequence of functional changes rather than irreversible structural defects during development (Ehninger and Silva, 2011).The possibility that mTOR inhibitors may have benefit in the treatment of TSC-brain disease was also highlighted by #AUTHOR_TAG et al (2008) study of a neuronal model of TSC.","['Cognitive abnormalities in adult mouse models of TSC have also been reported to reverse with mTOR inhibitors, even in the absence of neuropathology and seizures (Ehninger et al. 2008(Ehninger et al. , 2009.', 'This suggests that at least some of the TSC-related cognitive impairments are caused by disinhibited mTOR signaling in adults, and are the consequence of functional changes rather than irreversible structural defects during development (Ehninger and Silva, 2011).The possibility that mTOR inhibitors may have benefit in the treatment of TSC-brain disease was also highlighted by #AUTHOR_TAG et al (2008) study of a neuronal model of TSC.', 'They found improvement in biochemical and signaling profiles, reduction in neurofilament expression and phosphorylation, and markedly improved myelination during rapamycin and everolimus treatment.', 'All together, these studies support the notion that mTOR inhibition can be the key for an effective treatment of ASD associated with TSC.']",4,"['This suggests that at least some of the TSC-related cognitive impairments are caused by disinhibited mTOR signaling in adults, and are the consequence of functional changes rather than irreversible structural defects during development (Ehninger and Silva, 2011).The possibility that mTOR inhibitors may have benefit in the treatment of TSC-brain disease was also highlighted by #AUTHOR_TAG et al (2008) study of a neuronal model of TSC.', 'They found improvement in biochemical and signaling profiles, reduction in neurofilament expression and phosphorylation, and markedly improved myelination during rapamycin and everolimus treatment.', 'All together, these studies support the notion that mTOR inhibition can be the key for an effective treatment of ASD associated with TSC.']"

Methods: A total of 103 patients with TSC were evaluated for ASD. A retrospective review of patients' records was performed, including mutational analysis. EEG reports were analyzed for the presence of ictal and interictal epileptiform features. Brain MRI scans were evaluated for TSC neuropathology, including tuber burden. Results: Of the 103 patients with TSC, 40%were diagnosed with an ASD. On univariate analysis, patients with ASD were less likely to have mutations in the TSC1 gene. Patients with ASD also had an earlier age at seizure onset and more frequent seizures. On EEG, those with ASD had a significantly greater amount of interictal epileptiform features in the left temporal lobe only. On MRI, there were no differences in the regional distribution of tuber burden, although those with TSC2 and ASD had a higher prevalence of cyst-like tubers. Conclusions: The development of ASD in TSC is not well understood. Given our findings, ASD may be associated with persistent seizure activity early in development in particular brain regions, such as those responsible for social perception and communication in the left temporal lobe.

The diverse and varied presentations and progression can be life-threatening with significant impact on cost and quality of life. Current surveillance and management practices are highly variable among region and country, reflective of the fact that last consensus recommendations occurred in 1998 and an updated, comprehensive standard is lacking that incorporates the latest scientific evidence and current best clinical practices.MethodsThe 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Group, comprising 79 specialists from 14 countries, was organized into 12 separate subcommittees, each led by a clinician with advanced expertise in tuberous sclerosis complex and the relevant medical subspecialty. Each subcommittee focused on a specific disease area with important clinical management implications and was charged with formulating key clinical questions to address within its focus area, reviewing relevant literature, evaluating the strength of data, and providing a recommendation accordingly.ResultsThe updated consensus recommendations for clinical surveillance and management in tuberous sclerosis complex are summarized here.

The drug sirolimus suppresses mTOR signaling. Methods: We conducted a 24-month, nonrandomized, open-label trial to determine whether sirolimus reduces the angiomyolipoma volume in patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Sirolimus was administered for the first 12 months only. Serial magnetic resonance imaging of angiomyolipomas and brain lesions, computed tomography of lung cysts, and pulmonary-function tests were performed. Results: Of the 25 patients enrolled, 20 completed the 12-month evaluation, and 18 completed the 24-month evaluation. The mean (+/-SD) angiomyolipoma volume at 12 months was 53.2+/-26.6% of the baseline value (P<0.001) and at 24 months was 85.9+/-28.5% of the baseline value (P=0.005). At 24 months, five patients had a persistent reduction in the angiomyolipoma volume of 30% or more. During the period of sirolimus therapy, among patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) increased by 118+/-330 ml (P=0.06), the forced vital capacity (FVC) increased by 390+/-570 ml (P<0.001), and the residual volume decreased by 439+/-493 ml (P=0.02), as compared with baseline values. One year after sirolimus was discontinued, the FEV1 was 62+/-411 ml above the baseline value, the FVC was 346+/-712 ml above the baseline value, and the residual volume was 333+/-570 ml below the baseline value; cerebral lesions were unchanged. Five patients had six serious adverse events while receiving sirolimus, including diarrhea, pyelonephritis, stomatitis, and respiratory infections. Conclusions: Angiomyolipomas regressed somewhat during sirolimus therapy but tended to increase in volume after the therapy was stopped.

We hypothesized that during early brain development, seizures could alter regulators of synaptic development and underlie the interaction between epilepsy and autism. The mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) modulates protein translation and is dysregulated in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, a disorder characterized by epilepsy and autism. We used a rodent model of acute hypoxia-induced neonatal seizures that results in long term increases in neuronal excitability, seizure susceptibility, and spontaneous seizures, to determine how seizures alter mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. We hypothesized that seizures occurring at a developmental stage coinciding with a critical period of synaptogenesis will activate mTORC1, contributing to epileptic networks and autistic-like behavior in later life. Here we show that in the rat, baseline mTORC1 activation peaks during the first three postnatal weeks, and induction of seizures at postnatal day 10 results in further transient activation of its downstream targets phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46), phospho-p70S6K (Thr389) and phospho-S6 (Ser235/236), as well as rapid induction of activity-dependent upstream signaling molecules, including BDNF, phospho-Akt (Thr308) and phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204). Furthermore, treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin immediately before and after seizures reversed early increases in glutamatergic neurotransmission and seizure susceptibility and attenuated later life epilepsy and autistic-like behavior. Together, these findings suggest that in the developing brain the mTORC1 signaling pathway is involved in epileptogenesis and altered social behavior, and that it may be a target for development of novel therapies that eliminate the progressive effects of neonatal seizures.","Others have also provided evidence that autistic-like behavior can be prevented with mTOR treatment in mouse models of TSC (Tsai et al, 2012;#AUTHOR_TAG et al, 2012;Reith et al. 2013).","['Preclinical studies in animal models of TSC, however, have assessed the potential efficacy of mTOR-based treatment on TSC-related cognitive impairments.', 'In adult mice with a heterozygous, inactivating mutation in the TSC2 gene, mTOR inhibition reversed TSC-related learning and memory deficits.', 'These cognitive abnormalities emerged in the absence of neuropathology and seizures (Ehninger et al. 2008(Ehninger et al. , 2009.', 'A recent study by Sato et al.

First, coexpression of hamartin and tuberin repressed phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, resulting in increased association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E; importantly, a mutant of TSC2 derived from TSC patients was defective in repressing phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Second, the activity of S6K1 was repressed by coexpression of hamartin and tuberin, but the activity of rapamycin-resistant mutants of S6K1 were not affected, implicating mTOR in the TSC-mediated inhibitory effect on S6K1. Third, hamartin and tuberin blocked the ability of amino acids to activate S6K1 within nutrient-deprived cells, a process that is dependent on mTOR.

An alternative may be the use of everolimus, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin, a protein regulated by gene products involved in the tuberous sclerosis complex. METHODS Patients 3 years of age or older with serial growth of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas were eligible for this open-label study. The primary efficacy end point was the change in volume of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas between baseline and 6 months. We gave everolimus orally, at a dose of 3.0 mg per square meter of body-surface area, to achieve a trough concentration of 5 to 15 ng per milliliter. RESULTS We enrolled 28 patients. Everolimus therapy was associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in volume of the primary subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma, as assessed on independent central review (P<0.001 for baseline vs. 6 months), with a reduction of at least 30% in 21 patients (75%) and at least 50% in 9 patients (32%). Marked reductions were seen within 3 months and were sustained. There were no new lesions, worsening hydrocephalus, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, or necessity for surgical resection or other therapy for subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma. Of the 16 patients for whom 24-hour video electroencephalography data were available, seizure frequency for the 6-month study period (vs. the previous 6-month period) decreased in 9, did not change in 6, and increased in 1 (median change, _1 seizure; P=0.02). The mean (±SD) score on the validated Quality-of-Life in Childhood Epilepsy questionnaire (on which scores can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life) was improved at 3 months (63.4±12.4) and 6 months (62.1±14.2) over the baseline score (57.8±14.0). Single cases of grade 3 treatment-related sinusitis, pneumonia, viral bronchitis, tooth infection, stomatitis, and leukopenia were reported.

JOINSON"", ""F. J. O'CALLAGHAN"", ""J. P. OSBORNE"", ""C. MARTYN"", ""T. HARRIS"", ""P. F. BOLTON""]","Background: Intellectual impairments are a recognized feature of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), but the frequency and degree of intellectual impairments has not been systematically studied in large epidemiological samples using standardized measures. As such, the form of the IQ distribution (uni- or bi-modal) has not been established and the relationship between IQ and other features (e.g. epilepsy history) is poorly delineated. To address these shortcomings, we assessed the intellectual abilities of a large epidemiological sample of individuals with TSC, drawn from the 'Wessex' area of SW England and compared them with the abilities of their unaffected siblings.Method: Standardized tests were used to estimate the abilities of 108 (56 males, 52 females, median age=25, range=4-75) individuals with TSC and 29 unaffected siblings (14 males, 15 females, median age=18, range=6-55). Seizure history was obtained from informants and medical records.Results: Estimated IQ was bi-modally distributed: 55*5% had an IQ in the normal range; 14% had mild to severe impairments; and 30*5% had profound disability (IQ&lt;21). Forty-four per cent of the individuals with TSC had an IQ&lt;70. In the subset of normally intelligent individuals with TSC, IQ was normally distributed with a mean of 93*6. This mean was significantly lower than the mean IQ of unaffected siblings (IQ=105*6). All individuals with learning disability had a history of seizures that usually commenced before 12 months of age and that often presented as infantile spasms. Multivariate analyses indicated that a history of seizures as well as a history of infantile spasms was predictive of the degree of intellectual impairment.Conclusions: Intellectual abilities were bi-modally distributed in a representative sample of individuals with TSC. The likelihood of impairment was associated with a history of seizures, particularly infantile spasms.

Kohrman""]","Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder characterized by the formation of nonmalignant hamartomas in the brain, heart, skin, kidney, lung, and other organs. It is associated with autism, epilepsy, and other neurocognitive and behavioral disabilities. Wide phenotypic variation occurs in disease severity and natural course: some patients demonstrate minimal effects, e.g., skin changes; others manifest profound seizures and mental retardation. Tuberous sclerosis complex is caused by mutations in either the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 or 2 gene (coding for hamartin and tuberin, respectively). The tuberous sclerosis complex 1/tuberous sclerosis complex 2 protein dimer complex is a crucial inhibitory element in the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, regulating cell growth and proliferation. Until recently, few options existed, other than surgery, for treating symptoms of tuberous sclerosis complex related to the growth of hamartomas. Increased understanding of the genetic cause of the disease and underlying dysregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway has led to clinical trials of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, including sirolimus and everolimus. This review gives an overview of tuberous sclerosis complex and its molecular causes, and summarizes results from recent clinical trials of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors in patients with the disease.","In fact, everolimus has already been approved to treat this kind of TSC lesions (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2012).","['Clinical trials in TSC populations using everolimus (RAD001, Novartis), as mTOR inhibitor, have shown promising results regarding epilepsy, skin manifestations, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), and renal and lung manifestations (Bissler et al., 2008) and also improved subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), specific brain tumors associated with TSC (Krueger et al, 2010;J�_zwiak et al 2012;Curran et al 2012;Franz et al, 2013).', 'In fact, everolimus has already been approved to treat this kind of TSC lesions (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2012).']",0,"['Clinical trials in TSC populations using everolimus (RAD001, Novartis), as mTOR inhibitor, have shown promising results regarding epilepsy, skin manifestations, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), and renal and lung manifestations (Bissler et al., 2008) and also improved subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), specific brain tumors associated with TSC (Krueger et al, 2010;J_zwiak et al 2012;Curran et al 2012;Franz et al, 2013).', 'In fact, everolimus has already been approved to treat this kind of TSC lesions (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2012).']"

The rate for Asperger disorder is not well established, and a conservative figure is 2.5/10,000. Childhood disintegrative disorder is extremely rare with a pooled estimate across studies of 0.2/10,000. A detailed discussion of the possible interpretations of trends over time in prevalence rates is provided. There is evidence that changes in case definition and improved awareness explain much of the upward trend of rates in recent decades. However, available epidemiological surveys do not provide an adequate test of the hypothesis of a changing incidence of PDDs.","Autism may be present in up to 60% of these patients, and TSC accounts for 1 to 4% of all cases of autism (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2003;Curatolo et al, 2004;Ehninger, 2013).","['Autism is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with onset in early childhood, characterized by impairments in communication, reciprocal social interaction, and restricted and stereotyped patterns of interests and activities (Curatolo et al, 2004).', 'Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are frequently diagnosed in patients with TSC.', 'Autism may be present in up to 60% of these patients, and TSC accounts for 1 to 4% of all cases of autism (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2003;Curatolo et al, 2004;Ehninger, 2013).', 'In fact, the incidence of autism in patients with TSC may be higher than that of cardiac and renal abnormalities, for which screening is routinely conducted (Curatolo et al, 2004).', 'Although the majority of TSC individuals with autism have a history of infantile spasms, there are also subjects who develop autism but with no history of seizures (Numis et al., 2011), suggesting that additional factors also play a role in this association.']",0,"['Autism is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with onset in early childhood, characterized by impairments in communication, reciprocal social interaction, and restricted and stereotyped patterns of interests and activities (Curatolo et al, 2004).', 'Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are frequently diagnosed in patients with TSC.', 'Autism may be present in up to 60% of these patients, and TSC accounts for 1 to 4% of all cases of autism (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2003;Curatolo et al, 2004;Ehninger, 2013).']"

Early control of seizures and an early intensive behavioral intervention of autism during the period of brain plasticity can mitigate, but not reverse the final outcome.

The diverse and varied presentations and progression can be life-threatening with significant impact on cost and quality of life. Current surveillance and management practices are highly variable among region and country, reflective of the fact that last consensus recommendations occurred in 1998 and an updated, comprehensive standard is lacking that incorporates the latest scientific evidence and current best clinical practices.MethodsThe 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Group, comprising 79 specialists from 14 countries, was organized into 12 separate subcommittees, each led by a clinician with advanced expertise in tuberous sclerosis complex and the relevant medical subspecialty. Each subcommittee focused on a specific disease area with important clinical management implications and was charged with formulating key clinical questions to address within its focus area, reviewing relevant literature, evaluating the strength of data, and providing a recommendation accordingly.ResultsThe updated consensus recommendations for clinical surveillance and management in tuberous sclerosis complex are summarized here. The recommendations are relevant to the entire lifespan of the patient, from infancy to adulthood, including both individuals where the diagnosis is newly made as well as individuals where the diagnosis already is established.ConclusionsThe 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Recommendations provide an evidence-based, standardized approach for optimal clinical care provided for individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex","In addition to manifestations in the skin and nervous system, TSC is associated with hallmark tumors in the kidney, lung, heart and liver such as angiomyolipomas, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and rhabdomyomas (#AUTHOR_TAG et al, 2006;Curatolo et al, 2008;Orlova and Crino, 2010;Ehninger, 2013).","['Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurocutaneous disorder caused by mutations in either of the two tumor suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2, encoding hamartin and tuberin, respectively (van Slegtenhorst et al, 1997;European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis Consortium, 1993).', 'Typical TSC lesions include hypomelanic macules and facial angiofibromas, as well as brain cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) (Holmes et al, 2007;Curatolo et al, 2008;Sahin, 2012).', 'In addition to manifestations in the skin and nervous system, TSC is associated with hallmark tumors in the kidney, lung, heart and liver such as angiomyolipomas, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and rhabdomyomas (#AUTHOR_TAG et al, 2006;Curatolo et al, 2008;Orlova and Crino, 2010;Ehninger, 2013).']",0,"['Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurocutaneous disorder caused by mutations in either of the two tumor suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2, encoding hamartin and tuberin, respectively (van Slegtenhorst et al, 1997;European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis Consortium, 1993).', 'In addition to manifestations in the skin and nervous system, TSC is associated with hallmark tumors in the kidney, lung, heart and liver such as angiomyolipomas, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and rhabdomyomas (#AUTHOR_TAG et al, 2006;Curatolo et al, 2008;Orlova and Crino, 2010;Ehninger, 2013).']"

This suggests that traditional information retrieval techniques may not work well for answering web search requests.

The focus of the investigations is on the cognitive aspects of information retrieval. After defining the formal framework of the information retrieval (IR) process a theoretical section discusses the cognitive viewpoint on which the research is based, followed by an outline of applicable findings and theories within the fields of cognitive science and cognitive psychology. The experimental design involving tape-recording and analysis of verbal protocols is briefly described and considered. The main part of the paper concentrates on the results of investigations and considers certain implications. It is shown how the user's knowledge structures cope with the structures of the system. User needs seem often to be presented as a label which may create ambiguity problems. Functions of open and closed questions are investigated and certain behaviouristic factors discussed. Matching the knowledge structure of the user and the librarian is considered a kind of learning process. Librarians prefer search activity before consideration of the presented problem. Without a user present the librarian's IR process is determined by three search attitudes involving motives and expectations as to search routines and possibilities. Conceptual knowledge, previous search and working domain play important roles. The attitudes have consequences for the objectives concerning use of routines and for the use of search concepts.","Numerous studies have been performed on searchers' interaction with IR systems, in non-web systems #AUTHOR_TAG[2][3], but in particular with the advent of the Web [4][5][6].","[""Numerous studies have been performed on searchers' interaction with IR systems, in non-web systems #AUTHOR_TAG[2][3], but in particular with the advent of the Web [4][5][6]."", ""The study reported in this paper has as its point of departure the notion that effort invested in search processes can be investigated in the light of the concept 'search transition' [7].""]",0,"[""Numerous studies have been performed on searchers' interaction with IR systems, in non-web systems #AUTHOR_TAG[2][3], but in particular with the advent of the Web [4][5][6].""]"

Alternatively, with respect to the experimental Cranfield model which still is the dominating evaluation approach to the evaluation of IR and IIR systems. The three revolutions (the cognitive, the relevance, and the interactive revolution) put forward by Robertson and Hancock-Beaulieu (1992) are used as the framework to explain the current demand for alternative approaches to IIR systems evaluation. The three revolutions point to requirements that are not fulfilled by the Cranfield model. The Cranfield model does not deal with dynamic information needs but treats information needs as a static concept entirely reflected by the user request and search statement. Further, this model uses only binary, topical relevance ignoring the fact that relevance is a multidimensional and dynamic concept. The conclusion is that the batch-driven mode of the Cranfield model is not suitable for the evaluation of IIR systems which, if carried out as realistically as possible, requires human interaction, potentially dynamic information need interpretations, and the assignment of multidimensional and dynamic relevance. The main contribution of the work is the proposal of the three-part package to the evaluation of IIR systems Ð the so-called ÔIIR evaluation packageÕ. The aim of the package is two-fold: 1) to facilitate evaluation of IIR systems as realistically as possible with reference to actual information seeking and retrieval processes, though still in a relatively controlled evaluation environment; and 2) to calculate the IIR system performance taking into account the non-binary nature of the assigned relevance assessments and respecting the existing and different types of relevance.","Searchers were asked to perform two search sessions, to solve one fact-finding task and one research task, each task was formulated as a simulated work task #AUTHOR_TAG.","['Searchers were asked to perform two search sessions, to solve one fact-finding task and one research task, each task was formulated as a simulated work task #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Searchers were, for each task, asked to assess the relevance of any document (article) or document element (section or subsection) they viewed during the process.', 'All sessions were logged by the IR system, in order to compare the server and client logs a selection of sessions were also screen captured on the client side using Morae.', 'In our comparative analysis we have looked at 8 sessions in detail to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two logging procedures in connection with identifying different expressions of effort during information searching, relating these to explicit search transitions.', 'In addition we have studied the individual transition patterns of two selected sessions in order to study effort invested throughout the sessions.']",5,"['Searchers were asked to perform two search sessions, to solve one fact-finding task and one research task, each task was formulated as a simulated work task #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Searchers were, for each task, asked to assess the relevance of any document (article) or document element (section or subsection) they viewed during the process.']"

In this model, the next action that a user takes is determined by a probabilistic rule which is conditioned by the most recent experiences of the user. This model, which has achieved very limited success in describing real data, is at odds with the evidence of introspection in a crucial way. Introspection reveals that when we search we are, more or less, in a state of expectancy, which can be satisfied in a number of ways. In addition, the state can be modified by the accumulated evidence of our searches. The Markov model approach can not readily accommodate such persistence of intention and behavior. The Petri Net model, which has been developed to analyze the interdependencies among events in a communications network, can be adapted to this situation. In this adaptation, the so-called &amp;quot;transitions &amp;quot; of the Petri Net occur only when their necessary pre-conditions have been met. We are able to show that various key abstractions of information finding, such as &amp;quot;document relevance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a desired number of relevant documents&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;discouragement&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;exhaustion &amp;quot; and &amp;quot;satisfaction &amp;quot; can all be modeled using the Petri Net framework. Further, we show that this model leads naturally to a new approach to the collection of user data, and to the analysis of transaction logs, by providing a far richer description of the user&apos;s present state, without inducing a combinatorial explosion","Variants of Markov modeling have often been suggested for such modeling, in #AUTHOR_TAG weaknesses of this approach is discussed, and an alternative modeling approach with Petri nets are suggested.","['The term ""effort"", which received an early definition by Fenichel [12] as ""a set of search variables [including] e.g.', 'number of commands and descriptors [and] connect time"", is quite often considered in the more general literature on information seeking behavior, with this or a variety of other, more or less similar definitions.', 'Zippf\'s ""law of least effort"" is often invoked to explain users\' choice of information channel [13] , which refers to a number of studies who take this perspective.', 'When effort is considered in the more restricted environment of information search behavior, however, it is often relatively vaguely defined.', 'Typically, it is treated as in [14], where, in an investigation of the influence of user experience on search outcomes, effort is considered as one of several ""search language use patterns"" and defined to consist of ""mean number of cycles per topic, mean command frequency per topic, and mean number of documents visited per cycle"" without any motivation for this choice of parameters.', 'A number of authors invoke ""cognitive effort"" as distinct from observable, logged actions in their characterization of search [15].', 'Cognitive effort is a concept well known from fields such as psychology and decision theory, but as a parameter of search effort it is often treated with a similar lack of specific definition as the concept of effort in general.', 'Where it is defined the measurement definitions range widely, from ""pupil dilation"" in an eye-tracking study of search and evaluation behavior [16] to ""number of iterations, i.e. queries in a search"" [17].', 'The term transition, or parallel expressions such as shifts, state changes etc. is widely used in both the general literature on information seeking and more specifically in studies of information search behavior.', 'It is generally defined in terms of a move from one state to another (or a sequence of such moves).', ""Stages or patterns of stages appear in more and more fine-grained form in models of information seeking behavior from Ellis' and others' early models [18,19], and are becoming more and more fine-grained, as in Xie [20], where the interest is in shifting patterns between search stages."", 'Such stages may be identified for instance in information seeking mediation, as in [21] where stages are identified as sets of cognitive and operational elements and transitions between stages are identified through vocabulary changes in dialogue.', 'Transitions have been of particular interest to studies of search system interactions, where it has been thought that being able to detect transitions or distinct shifts in interaction would enable the automatic detection of patterns that might engender some kind of machine assistance or inform interface design.', 'Variants of Markov modeling have often been suggested for such modeling, in #AUTHOR_TAG weaknesses of this approach is discussed, and an alternative modeling approach with Petri nets are suggested.', 'In this paper and many others the transitions themselves are vaguely defined, and this is a persistent problem in the literature.']",1,"['Variants of Markov modeling have often been suggested for such modeling, in #AUTHOR_TAG weaknesses of this approach is discussed, and an alternative modeling approach with Petri nets are suggested.']"

The research analyzes the users' information seeking behavior as they move between search stages, and looks for patterns in the transition. The observed shifting behavior allows for examining the question of predictability. The observed shifting patterns lead to the development of a new model for information seeking behavior that describes multiple search stages, aspects and dimensions.

L\u00e1zaro"", ""Y. Cant\u00f3n"", ""A. Sol\u00e9-Benet"", ""J. Bevan"", ""R. Alexander"", ""L.G. Sancho"", ""J. Puigdef\u00e1bregas""]","Badlands often contain a mosaic of soil surface types with contrasting hydrological behaviour which drives their short term geomorphic evolution. The Tabernas badlands, in semiarid SE Spain, show a complex mosaic of bare ground, biological soil crusts and plant covered patches, and high variability of covers and morphologies. Previous work has identified the surfaces that act as sources of runoff and sediments and those that act as sinks; the pathways of runoff between surfaces, and the runoff and erosion at catchment scale. However, surfaces without vascular plants, can be quite dynamic, with important effects on geomorphic processes. This work aims to generate hypotheses about the dynamics of both bare soil (34% of the area) and biological soil crusts (33%), and to provide a first estimation of the growth rate of terricolous lichens (as increase of coverage) and their geomorphological implications. The dynamics of ten representative soil surfaces were photographically monitored over 13 years, recording the cover and pattern of bare soil and of the two main kinds of biological soil crust: Ôbrown crustÕ and Ôwhite crustÕ. Erosion/deposition were measured by erosion pins in unbounded plots, and the hydrological and erosional behaviour monitored in bounded plots under natural and simulated rainfall. Biological colonization and crust growth were studied from 2004 within cleared plots in four crust communities. Microclimate was continuously monitored in each community. After 13 years, net erosion was recorded only in previously eroded slopes and divides. Vegetated sites and those covered by biological soil crust remained more or less invariant or recorded sedimentation. In all white crust surfaces, whole crust cover increased by 3% on average, while macrolichen cover increased by nearly 30%. Within the driest brown crust, macrolichen cover increased by 7%, while the whole crust decreased by 3%. According to previous work, lichen cover, particularly of white crust, is often greater in north to east facing orientations because of the higher slope stability and the longer duration of moisture. However, the increase of the whole biological soil crust can depend more on species composition and previous cover and less or not at all on the aspect, although certain species do grow faster in particular orientations. Within the plots cleared in 2004 the greatest increase occurred in the pioneering brown crust, which reached an average of 26% cover after one year, in spite of it receiving the most insolation. Significant microclimatic differences exist among the communities, mainly in radiation, soil moisture and thallus surface temperature. Terricolous lichen crusts, primary colonizers of bare, sufficiently stable areas, can grow quickly and, by increasing soil stability and development and modifying surface hydrology, they can influence surface dynamics and ultimately landform dynamics. Crust growth rate probably decreases as its cover increases and it probably also oscillates with microclimatic oscillations. However, the high potential growth rate recorded allows detection not only of climatic changes but also short term (possibly seasonal) periods of stability. Extensive lichen crusts indicate low erosion rates and particular climatic conditions; variations of crust cover could indicate climatic (or land use) variations.","The influence of photobiont selection on the ecological amplitude of lichens is still largely underexplored (Peksa and Skaloud 2011) and shedding more light on this phenomenon would help towards understanding structure, composition and development of BCSs (Bowker 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2008).","['Very little is known about either the complexity or basis of the successful strategies of lichens in BSCs despite their world-wide importance (Grube et al. 2010).', 'Because of their slow growth, lichens cannot compete effectively against vascular plants but, in areas with Fig. 1 Typical lichen dominated soil crust in high alpine areas, with Psora decipiens, Fulgensia sp. and mosses extreme abiotic conditions such as long periods of drought or cold, higher plants are excluded and lichens fill this important niche (Lalley et al. 2006).', 'The symbiotic life form of lichens is composed of a fungal (mycobiont) and an photosynthetic partner (photobionts), and the latter can be an eukaryotic green alga (chlorobiont) and/or a cyanobacterium (cyanobiont).', 'The ability of mycobionts to switch photobionts (Nelsen and Gargas 2009;Otalora et al. 2010;Henskens et al. 2012) and associate with more than one photobiont species or genotype along a climatic gradient appears to be a mechanism used by lichens to adapt to particular habitats.', 'This has been reported for crustose lichens (Blaha et al. 2006;Muggia et al. 2008;Ruprecht et al. 2012) and for fruticose lichens (Kroken and Taylor 2000).', 'The influence of photobiont selection on the ecological amplitude of lichens is still largely underexplored (Peksa and Skaloud 2011) and shedding more light on this phenomenon would help towards understanding structure, composition and development of BCSs (Bowker 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2008).']",0,"['The influence of photobiont selection on the ecological amplitude of lichens is still largely underexplored (Peksa and Skaloud 2011) and shedding more light on this phenomenon would help towards understanding structure, composition and development of BCSs (Bowker 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2008).']"

Many lichens occupy large distributional ranges covering several climatic zones. So far, little is known about the large-scale phylogeography of lichen photobionts and their role in shaping the distributional ranges of lichens. We studied south polar, temperate and north polar populations of the widely distributed fruticose lichen Cetraria aculeata. Based on the DNA sequences from three loci for each symbiont, we compared the genetic structure of mycobionts and photobionts. Phylogenetic reconstructions and Bayesian clustering methods divided the mycobiont and photobiont data sets into three groups. An amova shows that the genetic variance of the photobiont is best explained by differentiation between temperate and polar regions and that of the mycobiont by an interaction of climatic and geographical factors. By partialling out the relative contribution of climate, geography and codispersal, we found that the most relevant factors shaping the genetic structure of the photobiont are climate and a history of codispersal. Mycobionts in the temperate region are consistently associated with a specific photobiont lineage. We therefore conclude that a photobiont switch in the past enabled C. aculeata to colonize temperate as well as polar habitats. Rare photobiont switches may increase the geographical range and ecological niche of lichen mycobionts by associating them with locally adapted photobionts in climatically different regions and, together with isolation by distance, may lead to genetic isolation between populations and thus drive the evolution of lichens.(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","This clade is sister to T. gigantea, a photobiont which is widely distributed in temperate habitats (#AUTHOR_TAG and Gärtner 1995).","['This evaluation of European lichen-dominated soil crusts from four geographically and climatically diverse sites revealed an unexpectedly high diversity of photobionts in association with the dominant lichen P. decipiens.', 'Until now, only the genus Asterochloris has been described as the photobiont of P. decipiens (Schaper and Ott 2003), but we detected 12 different groups of the genus Trebouxia as well as other eukaryotic green micro algae like C. saccharophilum.', 'Several of these micro algae are already known to exist as lichen photobionts, such as T. impressa, T. asymmetrica or the, as yet undescribed, Trebouxia sp.', 'URa2, URa4, URa6.', 'The latter three species have also been identified as photobionts from crustose lichens (Ruprecht et al. 2012).', 'Other Trebouxia species that are known as freeliving algae (e.g.', 'T. arboricola; Ettl and Gärtner 1995) were included in the analysis but not found in the soil-crust samples.', 'P. decipiens at Hochtor showed a shared use of the available photobionts with other lichen species that were present (see Online Resource 1) with each species having a different level of specificity towards to its photobiont.', 'We can conclude for P. decipiens that this lichen is not limited to a single species or even genus of photobiont but instead associates with a broad range of apparently locally available algae.', 'The low specificity of P. decipiens for its photobiont might contribute to the broad ecological amplitude of this lichen, a possibility already described for other lichens (Blaha et al. 2006).', 'Most photobiont species, especially from the genus Trebouxia, are cosmopolitan with more or less broad ecological preferences (Fernandez-Mendoza et al. 2011;Ruprecht et al. 2012) and this was true for the most commonly detected clades in this study.', 'However, several distinct and strongly supported clades of the genera Asterochloris and Trebouxia (Online Resource 2, Figs. 2, 3) do not seem to be cosmopolitan, e.g.', 'T. sp URa8 which, to date, has only been found at Tabernas.', 'This clade is sister to T. gigantea, a photobiont which is widely distributed in temperate habitats (#AUTHOR_TAG and Gärtner 1995).', 'This is a somewhat similar situation to that found in another study of the cosmopolitan photobiont T. jamesii.', 'Ruprecht et al.

The specificity of the cyanobacterium Nostoc found in lichens was evaluated at a broad geographical scale within one of the main families of lichen-forming fungi (Collemataceae) that associate exclusively with this photobiont. A phylogenetic study was conducted using rbcLXS sequences from Nostoc sampled from 79 thalli (representing 24 species within the Collemataceae), and 163 Nostoc sequences gathered from GenBank. Although most of the lichen-forming fungal species belonging to the Collemataceae exhibited the expected generalist pattern of association with multiple distinct lineages of Nostoc, five independent cases of one-to-one reciprocal specificity at the species level, including two that span intercontinental distributions, were discovered. Each of the five distinct monophyletic Nostoc groups, associated with these five highly specific mycobiont species, represent independent transitions from a generalist state during the evolution of both partners, which might be explained by transitions to asexual fungal reproduction, involving vertical photobiont transmission, and narrowing of ecological niches.Copyright  2010 Elsevier Inc.

The genetic structure of the photobiont population found in association with a lichen-forming fungal species could be affected by fungal reproductive mode and by the spatial extent of gene flow in the photobiont. Using DNA sequences from one nuclear ribosomal and two chloroplast loci, we analyzed the genetic structure of the photobiont associated with the fungus Ramalina menziesii at an oak woodland study site in southern California. We had previously shown that the fungus exhibited no genetic structure among four local sites or three phorophyte species. Our goals were to identify the photobiont species and assess its genetic structure.

In lichens, predominantly terrestrial associations of fungi with algae or cyanobacteria, the ecological preferences of photobionts have not been directly studied so far. Here, we examine the putative environmental requirements in lichenized alga Asterochloris, and search for the existence of ecological guilds in Asterochloris-associating lichens. Therefore, the presence of phylogenetic signal in several environmental traits was tested. Phylogenetic analysis based on the concatenated set of internal transcribed spacer rDNA and actin type I intron sequences from photobionts associated with lichens of the genera Lepraria and Stereocaulon (Stereocaulaceae, Ascomycota) revealed 13 moderately to well-resolved clades. Photobionts from particular algal clades were found to be associated with taxonomically different, but ecologically similar lichens. The rain and sun exposure were the most significant environmental factor, clearly distinguishing the Asterochloris lineages. The photobionts from ombrophobic and ombrophilic lichens were clustered in completely distinct clades. Moreover, two photobiont taxa were obviously differentiated based on their substrate and climatic preferences. Our study, thus reveals that the photobiont, generally the subsidiary member of the symbiotic lichen association, could exhibit clear preferences for environmental factors. These algal preferences may limit the ecological niches available to lichens and lead to the existence of specific lichen guilds.(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","The highly variable occurrence of different photobiont types in association with the same mycobiont, P. decipiens, across all sampled habitats supports the opinion that flexibility in photobiont choice may influence the ecological amplitude of lichens (#AUTHOR_TAG and Skaloud 2011).","['The highly variable occurrence of different photobiont types in association with the same mycobiont, P. decipiens, across all sampled habitats supports the opinion that flexibility in photobiont choice may influence the ecological amplitude of lichens (#AUTHOR_TAG and Skaloud 2011).', 'Low photobiont specificity is already known for several lichen species that show a wide ecological amplitude, e.g.', 'Lecanora rupicola, and it appears that the key BSC lichen P. decipiens might employ a similar strategy for colonizing highly diverse habitats.', 'In addition, the improved molecular techniques developed here can be important tools for future surveys of photobionts.', 'Our results provide basic information that can underpin conservation measures to protect this highly specialized and diverse community of organisms that colonises and protects the soil surface in large areas of the world.']",1,"['The highly variable occurrence of different photobiont types in association with the same mycobiont, P. decipiens, across all sampled habitats supports the opinion that flexibility in photobiont choice may influence the ecological amplitude of lichens (#AUTHOR_TAG and Skaloud 2011).', 'Low photobiont specificity is already known for several lichen species that show a wide ecological amplitude, e.g.']"

We used a molecular phylogenetic approach to investigate the degree of host specialization of cyanobacteria associated with four closely related species of the lichenized fungus Peltigera, and to compare these strains with other symbiotic cyanobacteria. We conducted phylogenetic analyses on 16S, rbcLX, and trnL sequences from cyanobacteria associated with multiple specimens of each lichen species and from symbionts of other fungi and plants, as well as from free-living strains of Nostoc and related genera of cyanobacteria. The genus Nostoc comprises two divergent lineages, but symbiotic strains occur primarily within a single monophyletic lineage that also includes free-living representatives. Cyanobacteria from the same lichen species were often more closely related to strains from other species or to plant symbionts or free-living strains than to each other. These results indicate that host specialization is low for the genus Nostoc, and suggest that opportunities for coevolution with its partners may be rare.","Peltigera rufescens, known to have a cyanobacterium as its primary photobiont (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2005), was also found to be associated with chlorobionts (Henskens et al. 2012).","['The species specificity of the mycobiont towards its photobiont was quite low for P. decipiens.', 'In contrast, Fulgensia bracteata ssp.', 'deformis (which has so far only been found Other EGMA other eukaryotic green micro algae in samples from Hochtor) only occurred with T. sp.', 'URa4 and A. sp.', 'URa15 (the latter until now only known from this area, Figs. 2, 3).', 'Peltigera rufescens, known to have a cyanobacterium as its primary photobiont (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2005), was also found to be associated with chlorobionts (Henskens et al. 2012).', 'Specimens of P. rufescens from Ruine Homburg were associated with T. sp.', 'URa6 and A. sp.', 'URa16, although other chlorobionts were available at the site; at Hochtor P. rufescens was found with T. impressa (see Online Resource 1, Figs. 2, 3).']",1,"['Peltigera rufescens, known to have a cyanobacterium as its primary photobiont (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2005), was also found to be associated with chlorobionts (Henskens et al. 2012).']"

Metabolic activity of the poikilohydric organisms found in these crusts is dominated by quick and drastic changes in moisture availability and long periods of drought. Under controlled conditions, we studied the role of water content on photosynthetic and respiratory CO2 exchange of three green algal soil crust lichens from a desert site in southern Utah (USA): Diploschistes diacapsis (Ach.) Lumbsch, Psora cerebriformis W. Weber, and Squamarina lentigera (Weber) Poelt. Photosynthetic metabolism is activated by extremely small amounts of moisture; lower compensation values for net photosynthesis (NP) are reached between 0.05 and 0.27 mm of precipitation equivalent. Thus, the lichens can use very low degrees of hydration for carbon gain. Maximal NP occurs between 0.39 and 0.94 mm precipitation equivalent, and area-related rates equal 2.6Ð5.2 _mol CO2 m_2s_1. All three tested species show Ôsun plantÕ features, including high light requirements for CO2 exchange compensation and for NP saturation. Diploschistes diacapsis maintains high rates of NP at full water saturation. In contrast, suprasaturated thalli of the other two species show a strong depression in NP which can be removed or reduced by increased external CO2 concentration. Consequently, this depression is most probably caused by increased thallus diffusive resistances due to pathway blockage by water. This depression will greatly limit carbon gain of these species in the field after heavy rain. It occurs at all temperatures of ecological relevance and also under conditions of low light. However, maximum water holding capacity of P. cerebriformis and S. lentigera is higher than that of D. diacapsis. This could mean that periods of hydration favorable for metabolic activity for those two species last longer than those of D. diacapsis. This might compensate for their lower rates of NP during suprasaturation. Thus, two different strategies might have developed for lichen existence in the specific and extreme arid soil crust habitat. Data about habitat conditions for the different lichen species are needed in order to test this hypothesis and to allow interpretation and prediction of perfonnance of these soil crust lichens in nature.","Due to their poikilohydric lifestyle, lichens are very well adapted to extreme habitats with rapid temperature and moisture fluctuations, such as high alpine areas and arid areas with high insolation in southern Europe and other parts of the world (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1997;Lange 2000).","['The species composition of BSCs mainly depends on water-availability, climate zone and soil-type (Rosentreter and Belnap 2001).', 'While cyanobacteria dominate soil crusts in hot desert regions, lichens tend to be more abundant in regions with higher precipitation (Belnap et al. 2001).', 'Due to their poikilohydric lifestyle, lichens are very well adapted to extreme habitats with rapid temperature and moisture fluctuations, such as high alpine areas and arid areas with high insolation in southern Europe and other parts of the world (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1997;Lange 2000).', 'BSC-forming lichens are present in different growth forms, crustose, foliose and fruticose, with individual characteristics according to the climate zones (Grube et al. 2010).', 'In particular, crustose lichens like Buellia sp. and closely attached foliose lichens, such as the common Psora sp., form a compact and stable zone in the upper few millimetres of the substratum (Belnap and Lange 2001).', 'The rhizines and rhizomorphs of lichens can stabilize soils more efficiently than cyanobacterial dominated BSC and contribute to a higher amount of soil carbon and nitrogen, soil moisture and plantavailable nutrients (Belnap et al. 2006;Maestre et al. 2011).']",0,"['Due to their poikilohydric lifestyle, lichens are very well adapted to extreme habitats with rapid temperature and moisture fluctuations, such as high alpine areas and arid areas with high insolation in southern Europe and other parts of the world (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1997;Lange 2000).']"

This study examines the distribution of arthropod communities in the northern Namib Desert to evaluate whether a lichen-rich area is more or less productive than adjacent habitats in terms of the consumers each supports. Arthropods are diverse and highly endemic in the Namib Desert and lichens dominate this desert's extensive gravel plains. We sampled lichen-rich, dwarf shrub, and unvegetated sites and found distinct arthropod assemblages in the lichen-dominated sites, including species unique to lichen sites. Arthropod assemblages in two of the lichen sites were similar to those found in the dwarf shrub site. In a canonical correspondence analysis, crustose lichens and overall lichen cover were key in driving the variance in arthropod assemblages within the lichen sites. Furthermore, lichen morphotypes, overall lichen cover and species richness, were significantly correlated with the representation of arthropod subgroups and arthropod species richness. These findings provide evidence that lichen-dominated soil crusts in the Namib Desert are important supporters of secondary production, warranting more in-depth studies into the ecology and conservation of this lichen-rich habitat in warm deserts.","Because of their slow growth, lichens cannot compete effectively against vascular plants but, in areas with Fig. 1 Typical lichen dominated soil crust in high alpine areas, with Psora decipiens, Fulgensia sp. and mosses extreme abiotic conditions such as long periods of drought or cold, higher plants are excluded and lichens fill this important niche (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2006).","['Very little is known about either the complexity or basis of the successful strategies of lichens in BSCs despite their world-wide importance (Grube et al. 2010).', 'Because of their slow growth, lichens cannot compete effectively against vascular plants but, in areas with Fig. 1 Typical lichen dominated soil crust in high alpine areas, with Psora decipiens, Fulgensia sp. and mosses extreme abiotic conditions such as long periods of drought or cold, higher plants are excluded and lichens fill this important niche (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2006).', 'The symbiotic life form of lichens is composed of a fungal (mycobiont) and an photosynthetic partner (photobionts), and the latter can be an eukaryotic green alga (chlorobiont) and/or a cyanobacterium (cyanobiont).', 'The ability of mycobionts to switch photobionts (Nelsen and Gargas 2009;Otalora et al. 2010;Henskens et al. 2012) and associate with more than one photobiont species or genotype along a climatic gradient appears to be a mechanism used by lichens to adapt to particular habitats.', 'This has been reported for crustose lichens (Blaha et al. 2006;Muggia et al. 2008;Ruprecht et al. 2012) and for fruticose lichens (Kroken and Taylor 2000).', 'The influence of photobiont selection on the ecological amplitude of lichens is still largely underexplored (Peksa and Skaloud 2011) and shedding more light on this phenomenon would help towards understanding structure, composition and development of BCSs (Bowker 2007;Lazaro et al. 2008).']",1,"['Because of their slow growth, lichens cannot compete effectively against vascular plants but, in areas with Fig. 1 Typical lichen dominated soil crust in high alpine areas, with Psora decipiens, Fulgensia sp. and mosses extreme abiotic conditions such as long periods of drought or cold, higher plants are excluded and lichens fill this important niche (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2006).']"

Bowker""]","Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are ubiquitous lichen-bryophyte microbial communities, which are critical structural and functional components of many ecosystems. However, BSCs are rarely addressed in the restoration literature. The purposes of this review were to examine the ecological roles BSCs play in succession models, the backbone of restoration theory, and to discuss the practical aspects of rehabilitating BSCs to disturbed ecosystems. Most evidence indicates that BSCs facilitate succession to later seres, suggesting that assisted recovery of BSCs could speed up succession. Because BSCs are ecosystem engineers in high abiotic stress systems, loss of BSCs may be synonymous with crossing degradation thresholds. However, assisted recovery of BSCs may allow a transition from a degraded steady state to a more desired alternative steady state. In practice, BSC rehabilitation has three major components: (1) establishment of goals; (2) selection and implementation of rehabilitation techniques; and (3) monitoring. Statistical predictive modeling is a useful method for estimating the potential BSC condition of a rehabilitation site. Various rehabilitation techniques attempt to correct, in decreasing order of difficulty, active soil erosion (e.g., stabilization techniques), resource deficiencies (e.g., moisture and nutrient augmentation), or BSC propagule scarcity (e.g., inoculation). Success will probably be contingent on prior evaluation of site conditions and accurate identification of constraints to BSC reestablishment. Rehabilitation of BSCs is attainable and may be required in the recovery of some ecosystems. The strong influence that BSCs exert on ecosystems is an underexploited opportunity for restorationists to return disturbed ecosystems to a desirable trajectory.","The influence of photobiont selection on the ecological amplitude of lichens is still largely underexplored (Peksa and Skaloud 2011) and shedding more light on this phenomenon would help towards understanding structure, composition and development of BCSs (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007;Lazaro et al. 2008).","['Very little is known about either the complexity or basis of the successful strategies of lichens in BSCs despite their world-wide importance (Grube et al. 2010).', 'Because of their slow growth, lichens cannot compete effectively against vascular plants but, in areas with Fig. 1 Typical lichen dominated soil crust in high alpine areas, with Psora decipiens, Fulgensia sp. and mosses extreme abiotic conditions such as long periods of drought or cold, higher plants are excluded and lichens fill this important niche (Lalley et al. 2006).', 'The symbiotic life form of lichens is composed of a fungal (mycobiont) and an photosynthetic partner (photobionts), and the latter can be an eukaryotic green alga (chlorobiont) and/or a cyanobacterium (cyanobiont).', 'The ability of mycobionts to switch photobionts (Nelsen and Gargas 2009;Otalora et al. 2010;Henskens et al. 2012) and associate with more than one photobiont species or genotype along a climatic gradient appears to be a mechanism used by lichens to adapt to particular habitats.', 'This has been reported for crustose lichens (Blaha et al. 2006;Muggia et al. 2008;Ruprecht et al. 2012) and for fruticose lichens (Kroken and Taylor 2000).', 'The influence of photobiont selection on the ecological amplitude of lichens is still largely underexplored (Peksa and Skaloud 2011) and shedding more light on this phenomenon would help towards understanding structure, composition and development of BCSs (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007;Lazaro et al. 2008).']",4,"['Very little is known about either the complexity or basis of the successful strategies of lichens in BSCs despite their world-wide importance (Grube et al. 2010).', 'Because of their slow growth, lichens cannot compete effectively against vascular plants but, in areas with Fig. 1 Typical lichen dominated soil crust in high alpine areas, with Psora decipiens, Fulgensia sp. and mosses extreme abiotic conditions such as long periods of drought or cold, higher plants are excluded and lichens fill this important niche (Lalley et al. 2006).', 'The influence of photobiont selection on the ecological amplitude of lichens is still largely underexplored (Peksa and Skaloud 2011) and shedding more light on this phenomenon would help towards understanding structure, composition and development of BCSs (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007;Lazaro et al. 2008).']"

The paper emphasises the importance of examining venture capital in the light of recent developments in corporate finance and its distinctiveness from other forms of finance. In order to understand current developments, the paper adopts a framework which combines industry/market and firm levels of analysis. Existing literature is reviewed using this framework. Industry level issues relate to rivalry between firms, the power of suppliers and customers, and the threats from new entrants and substitutes. Firm level issues concern deal generation, initial and second screening, valuation and due diligence, deal approval and structuring, post-contractual monitoring, investment realisation, and entrepreneurs' exit and recontracting with venture capitalists. This is followed by a review of the evidence on the performance of venture capital firms. The paper suggests potentially fruitful areas for further research including the extension of analysis to cover all stages of venture capital investment, examination of the inter-linkages between industry and firm level issues and between stages in the venture capital process, as well as further analysis of deal structuring issues and investment realisation and recontracting.

It involves a pre- and post-acquisition analysis of employment and performance characteristics for a sample of acquired firms and a matched sample of non-acquired firms.    Research Findings: There is a significant decrease in employment in acquired firms in the year immediately after the completion of the IBO compared with non-acquired firms. Further analysis fails to identify any parallel or subsequent increase in firm productivity or profitability. This evidence suggests that the observed downsizing has not been effective either in disciplining staff or imparting a clearer focus to activities.    Academic Implications: The results of this study add to our understanding of the employment effects of private equity acquisitions, especially IBOs. Two important theoretical issues emerge. The first is a need to conceptualize skills and human capabilities on a collective dimension, specific to a particular organizational setting, and the extent to which they contribute to the organization's performance. The second is the importance of understanding managers as operating in particular social settings, making subjective choices based on their specific knowledge and experiences.    Practitioner Implications: The main practitioner implication of our study is that companies acquired via IBOs do not exhibit increased productivity or profitability in the wake of a significant reduction in employment.

The use of event studies to gauge wealth creation in takeovers is unjustified. The paper also suggests a theory of managerial behavior, in which hiring and entrenching trustworthy managers enables shareholders to commit to upholding implicit contracts with stakeholders. Hostile takeovers are an innovation allowing shareholders to renege on such contracts ex post, against managers' will.

Private Equity funds have grown from a tiny part of the financial market in the early 1980s to an important global force today. Morgan Stanley estimated in 2007 that 2,700 Private equity funds represented 25% of global mergers and acquisition activity, 50% of leverage loan volume, 33% of the high yield bond market, and 33% of the initial public offerings market. I present in these slides my belief, first argued in my 1989 Harvard Business Review paper entitled The Eclipse of the Public Corporation that Private Equity is best thought of as a new and powerful model of General Management. I also summarize some important characteristics of Private Equity that contribute to value creation, how Private Equity generally implements Strategic Value Accountability (what I have labelled the missing concept in corporate governance) much better than the public corporation, and how Private Equity avoids much of the out-of-integrity gaming and lying that dominates the relations between public firms and capital markets. I close by summarizing some growing problematical trends and practices that threaten the success of this new business model and the future of the Private Equity industry (in particular the threat posed by the proliferation of non-equity based fees charged by Private Equity firms, and the going public of the core management private equity company such as that by Fortress and Blackstone and the raising of permanent public capital to substitute for the non-permanent limited partnership capital such as that by KKR in Europe).","Theoretically, #AUTHOR_TAG (2007) argues that IBOs provide a solution to perceived agency problems and therefore serve to re-establish the link between the business and its owners, specifically the desire on the part of owners to maximize returns, promoting downsizing as an antidote to previous managerial empire building.","['Notwithstanding the issues discussed above, there remains much controversy over the employment consequences of private equity takeovers and whether they are particularly likely to leave workers worse off.', 'MBIs and IBOs normally bring about a change in management.', 'Theoretically, #AUTHOR_TAG (2007) argues that IBOs provide a solution to perceived agency problems and therefore serve to re-establish the link between the business and its owners, specifically the desire on the part of owners to maximize returns, promoting downsizing as an antidote to previous managerial empire building.', 'Hence, there is a greater likelihood of breaches of implicit contracts that the incumbent management had with the workforce.', 'Unlike incumbent managers, external managers are also expected to be less willing and able to cost intangible human assets, other than in terms of immediate salary and wage related expenses (c.f.', 'Aoki, 2010).', 'Such breaches are especially likely in IBOs compared to other types of private equity acquisitions.']",0,"['Notwithstanding the issues discussed above, there remains much controversy over the employment consequences of private equity takeovers and whether they are particularly likely to leave workers worse off.', 'Theoretically, #AUTHOR_TAG (2007) argues that IBOs provide a solution to perceived agency problems and therefore serve to re-establish the link between the business and its owners, specifically the desire on the part of owners to maximize returns, promoting downsizing as an antidote to previous managerial empire building.', 'Hence, there is a greater likelihood of breaches of implicit contracts that the incumbent management had with the workforce.', 'Unlike incumbent managers, external managers are also expected to be less willing and able to cost intangible human assets, other than in terms of immediate salary and wage related expenses (c.f.']"

Hansom"", ""A.M. Hall""]","Cliff-top storm deposits (CTSDs) are known to occur on cliffs at elevations of up to 50 m above sea level at exposed sites on the deep-water coasts of the British Isles. Eye-witness accounts and time-series field mapping of CTSDs demonstrate their formation over the historical period and their continued modification during major storms, with CTSDs burying a range of modern human-derived debris. Older deposits show surface lichen growth and weathering effects that relate to the relative age of CTSDs. Over longer time spans, buried sand and peat deposits provide dates on phases of CTSD emplacement and mobilisation and so provide an indication of the frequency and timing of the most severe storms. Two adjacent sites in Shetland provide a combination of 14C dates on peat buried beneath storm-deposited boulders, 14C dates on marine shells buried inside CTSD boulder ridges and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages on sands intercalated with storm-derived boulders. Although the precision is low, this evidence identifies phases of exceptional storm activity spanning approximately 400-550, 700-1050, 1300-1900 and since 1950 AD. By the very nature of cliff-top erosion and deposition these records are fragmentary, yet the timeline of major storms recorded in the Shetland cliffs matches fairly well with the more general record of storminess in the North Atlantic derived from the sea salt record in the GISP2 ice core. As such CTSDs represent an overlooked archive of storm sedimentation with the potential to elucidate local storm chronologies as well as informing debate surrounding the palaeo-tempestology and impact of major cyclones and hurricanes.","Numerous geomorphic studies along coasts of the European North Atlantic implicate increased storminess in the Holocene with the reactivation of coastal dune system (e.g., Clarke and Rendell, 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG and Hall, 2009).","['The current migration of dunes on Cape Cod is inferred to reflect a legacy of landscape disturbance, specifically forest clear-cutting, grazing and agricultural practices, associated with European settlement starting in the early 17th century and continuing into the 20th century (McCaffrey and Stilgoe, 1981;Rubertone, 1985;Motzkin et al., 2002;Eberhardt et al., 2003;Forman et al., 2008).', 'Other factors such as storminess, hurricane-force winds (Bosse et al., 2001;Eberhardt et al., 2003) and forest fires (Motzkin et al., 2002;Parshall et al., 2003) may have contributed to historic disturbance of this dune landscape.', 'Numerous geomorphic studies along coasts of the European North Atlantic implicate increased storminess in the Holocene with the reactivation of coastal dune system (e.g., Clarke and Rendell, 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG and Hall, 2009).', 'However, uncertainty remains if periods of increased storminess and/or hurricane landfalls for the exposed Cape Cod spit during the Holocene (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013) were of sufficient magnitude to disturb this forest ecosystem and reactivated dunes.', 'Proxy records of hurricane occurrence from coastal overwash timeseries (e.g., Donnelly et al., 2001;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007) and from marine sediment cores extracted strategically along the Bahama Bank (Williams, 2013) to reflect wave climate indicate heightened hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean between 4900 and 3600, 2500, and 1000, and 600 and 400 years BP (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).']",0,"['Numerous geomorphic studies along coasts of the European North Atlantic implicate increased storminess in the Holocene with the reactivation of coastal dune system (e.g., Clarke and Rendell, 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG and Hall, 2009).']"

Storms are thought to be an important mechanism for transporting coarse sediment from shallow carbonate platforms to the deep-sea, and bank-edge sediments may offer an unexplored archive of long-term hurricane activity. Here, we develop this new approach, reconstructing more than 7000 years of North Atlantic hurricane variability using coarse-grained deposits in sediment cores from the leeward margin of the Great Bahama Bank. High energy event layers within the resulting archive are (1) broadly correlated throughout an offbank transect of multi-cores, (2) closely matched with historic hurricane events, and (3) synchronous with previous intervals of heightened North Atlantic hurricane activity in overwash reconstructions from Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the Bahamas. Lower storm frequency prior to 4400 yrs B.P. in our records suggests that precession and increased NH summer insolation may have greatly limited hurricane potential intensity, outweighing weakened ENSO and a stronger West African Monsoon--factors thought to be favorable for hurricane development.","However, uncertainty remains if periods of increased storminess and/or hurricane landfalls for the exposed Cape Cod spit during the Holocene (Mann et al., 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013) were of sufficient magnitude to disturb this forest ecosystem and reactivated dunes.","['The current migration of dunes on Cape Cod is inferred to reflect a legacy of landscape disturbance, specifically forest clear-cutting, grazing and agricultural practices, associated with European settlement starting in the early 17th century and continuing into the 20th century (McCaffrey and Stilgoe, 1981;Rubertone, 1985;Motzkin et al., 2002;Eberhardt et al., 2003;Forman et al., 2008).', 'Other factors such as storminess, hurricane-force winds (Bosse et al., 2001;Eberhardt et al., 2003) and forest fires (Motzkin et al., 2002;Parshall et al., 2003) may have contributed to historic disturbance of this dune landscape.', 'Numerous geomorphic studies along coasts of the European North Atlantic implicate increased storminess in the Holocene with the reactivation of coastal dune system (e.g., Clarke and Rendell, 2009;Hansom and Hall, 2009).', 'However, uncertainty remains if periods of increased storminess and/or hurricane landfalls for the exposed Cape Cod spit during the Holocene (Mann et al., 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013) were of sufficient magnitude to disturb this forest ecosystem and reactivated dunes.', 'Proxy records of hurricane occurrence from coastal overwash timeseries (e.g., Donnelly et al., 2001;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007) and from marine sediment cores extracted strategically along the Bahama Bank (Williams, 2013) to reflect wave climate indicate heightened hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean between 4900 and 3600, 2500, and 1000, and 600 and 400 years BP (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).']",1,"['However, uncertainty remains if periods of increased storminess and/or hurricane landfalls for the exposed Cape Cod spit during the Holocene (Mann et al., 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013) were of sufficient magnitude to disturb this forest ecosystem and reactivated dunes.', 'Proxy records of hurricane occurrence from coastal overwash timeseries (e.g., Donnelly et al., 2001;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007) and from marine sediment cores extracted strategically along the Bahama Bank (Williams, 2013) to reflect wave climate indicate heightened hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean between 4900 and 3600, 2500, and 1000, and 600 and 400 years BP (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).']"

An aerial photographic time series from AD 1938 to 2003 quantifies dune movement that reflects processes over centuries and documents accelerated parabolic dune movement at ~4 m/yr from 1938 to 1977 during a drier interval. In contrast, dune movement between 1987 and 2003 slowed to ~1 m/yr with wetter conditions. Wetlands expand post dune movement often forming in dune blowouts with seasonally wet conditions. Stratigraphic studies, coupled with optically stimulated luminescence ages, place erosion and burial of the pre-settlement forest soil by migrating dunes at AD 1690 ± 40 yr, with aeolian deposition continuing into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, consistent with the historic record of land surface conditions. A threshold of landscape stability was exceeded in the late seventeenth to early eighteenth centuries, indicated by dune formation in response to human-induced land-cover changes, concomitant severe droughts and exposure to tropical storm/hurricane windfield. Dune orientation indicates preferential movement during winter with winds dominantly from the WÑNW and with reduced vegetation cover. The present high biodiversity in interdunal wetlands is a legacy of aeolian processes from landscape disturbance initiated by European settlers in the seventeenth century.","Despite these wet conditions parabolic dunes on the outermost coast of Cape Cod are currently active and have average migration rates between 2.1 and 3.4 m/year for the 20th and 21st century (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008).","['Eolian landscapes like actively migrating parabolic dunes on the outer coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts and within Cape Cod National Seashore (Figure 1) are sensitive indicators of environmental change.', 'Activation of this dune system reflects fundamental sedimentologic controls on sand availability and supply and the persistence of wind speeds that surpass a threshold (>5 m/s) for particle entrainment (Fryberger and Dean, 1979;Pye and Tsoar, 1990, pp. 127-145).', 'The availability of sand for eolian transport is often mediated by the type and extent of vegetation cover on dunes, and may be further controlled by moisture availability, edaphic associations (cf.', 'related to soil processes) and landscape disturbance (e.g., Sala et al., 1988;Mangan et al., 2004;Hugenholtz and Wolfe, 2005;Luna et al., 2011).', 'Cape Cod is a mesic (e.g., moist) environment with mean annual precipitation of 106.5 cm and with mean monthly totals that are relatively consistent between 7 and 11 cm (Provincetown: 1941(Provincetown: -2000NOAA, 2002).', 'Despite these wet conditions parabolic dunes on the outermost coast of Cape Cod are currently active and have average migration rates between 2.1 and 3.4 m/year for the 20th and 21st century (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008).', 'The avalanche slopes of these actively migrating dunes are burying an adjacent forest of pitch pine and oak; an observation also made by naturalist Henry David Thoreau in 1849 (Thoreau, 2004, p. 160).']",4,"['Eolian landscapes like actively migrating parabolic dunes on the outer coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts and within Cape Cod National Seashore (Figure 1) are sensitive indicators of environmental change.', 'Despite these wet conditions parabolic dunes on the outermost coast of Cape Cod are currently active and have average migration rates between 2.1 and 3.4 m/year for the 20th and 21st century (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008).']"

Marsicek"", ""Bryan Shuman"", ""Simon Brewer"", ""David R. Foster"", ""W. Wyatt Oswald""]","Abstract A decline of hemlock (Tsuga) populations at ca 5.5 ka (thousands of calibrated radiocarbon years before 1950 AD) stands out as the most abrupt vegetation change of the Holocene in North America, but remains poorly understood after decades of study. Recent analyses of fossil pollen have revealed a concurrent, abrupt oak (Quercus) decline and increases in the abundance of beech (Fagus) and pine (Pinus) on Cape Cod in eastern Massachusetts, but the replacement of drought-tolerant oaks by moisture-sensitive beeches appears inconsistent with low lake levels in the region at the same time. The oak and beech changes are also limited to coastal areas, and the coastal-inland differences require an explanation. Here, we develop a new lake-level reconstruction from Deep Pond, Cape Cod by using a transect of sediment cores and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) profiles to constrain the past elevations of the sandy, littoral zone of the pond. The reconstruction shows that a series of multi-century episodes of low water coincide with the abrupt hemlock and oak declines, and interrupt subsequent phases of hemlock recovery. The lake-level variations equal precipitation deficits of ~100 mm superimposed on a Holocene long moisture increase of >400 mm. However, because moisture deficits do not easily explain the oak and beech changes, we also evaluate how the climate preferences of the regional vegetation changed over time by matching the fossil pollen assemblages from Deep Pond with their modern equivalents. Reconstructions of the precipitation requirements of the vegetation correlate well even in detail with the lake-level record (r = 0.88 at Deep Pond), and indicate close tracking of effective moisture (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) by the vegetation despite the abrupt species declines, which could have decoupled climate and vegetation trends. Reconstructions of the temperature preferences of the vegetation indicate that coastal sites may have cooled by 0.5-2.5 degC after ca 5.5 ka, while inland sites warmed by 0.5-1 degC. The change in coastal temperature preferences agrees with sea surface cooling in the western Atlantic Ocean of >1 degC. Consequently, the persistence of low hemlock abundance after 5.5 ka in the northeast U.S. may have resulted from oceanic changes that produced multi-century droughts and thus delayed the post-decline recovery of hemlock populations.","5.5-3.8 ka and is associated with a broad scale drying (e.g., Newby et al., 2000;Shuman et al., 2001;Shuman and Donnelly, 2006;Oswald et al., 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013).","['Stratigraphic, sedimentologic and geochronologic data indicate that there may be six distinct periods of eolian deposition in the Cape Cod dune field (Figure 9).', 'The oldest recognized depositional event is at the base of the Highway 6 section, where quartz grains yielded an OSL age of 3.7 �� 0.3 ka (Figure 6).', 'This is a single site, with one OSL age, and thus it is unknown how pervasive is this early eolian depositional event.', 'Lacustrine sediment cores from the northeastern U.S. show a decline in Hemlock (Tsuga sp.), a decrease in lake level, or an increase in clastic sedimentation ca.', '5.5-3.8', '5.5-3.8 ka and is associated with a broad scale drying (e.g., Newby et al., 2000;Shuman et al., 2001;Shuman and Donnelly, 2006;Oswald et al., 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013).', 'Recent analysis of paleolimnologic data indicates that this drying is associated with cooling of coastal air by 0.5-2.5 _�� C and a precipitation decrease of ___100 mm, linked to cooler surface temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean (Marsicek et al., 2013).', 'Wetter conditions prevailed post 3.8 ka (cf.', 'Shuman and Donnelly, 2006;Oswald et al., 2007;Marsicek et al., 2013) (Figure 9) with an inferred period of heightened hurricane activity ca.', '3.6-3.4', 'ka (Toomey et al., 2013).', 'Cores from the Makepeace Cedar Swamp in far eastern Massachusetts indicate the onset of the wettest conditions post-glacial at ca. 3.2 ka (Newby et al., 2000).', 'The penultimate eolian depositional event is represented by only the Trailhead site with two OSL ages of ca.', '2.4 ka (Figure 6).', 'The spatial extent of this eolian depositional event is unknown though these ages may be coincident with a pronounced period of increased hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean (Toomey et al., 2013), but with dry and cool conditions on Cape Cod (Shuman and Donnelly, 2006;Marsicek et al., 2013) (Figure 9).', 'It is salient to note that there is an absence in the presented stratigraphic record of eolian sand deposited ca. 3 ka ago (Figure 9), when inferred hurricane activity was heightened (Toomey et al., 2013).']",1,"['5.5-3.8 ka and is associated with a broad scale drying (e.g., Newby et al., 2000;Shuman et al., 2001;Shuman and Donnelly, 2006;Oswald et al., 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013).']"

We use a paleoecological approach on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to assess landscape-scale variation in pitch pineÐoak vegetation and fire occurrence on the pre-European landscape and to determine changes resulting from European land use. Fossil pollen and charcoal preserved in seven lakes confirm a close link between landform and the pre-European distribution of vegetation. Pine forests, dominated by Pinus rigida, were closely associated with xeric outwash deposits, whereas oakÐhardwood forests were associated with landforms having finer grained soils and variable topography. In general, fire was much more abundant on Cape Cod than most other areas in New England, but its occurrence varied geographically at two scales. On the western end of Cape Cod, fires were more prevalent in pine forests (outwash) than in oakÐhardwood forests (moraines). In contrast, fires were less common on the narrow and northÐsouth trending eastern Cape, perhaps because of physical limits on fire spread. The most rapid and substantial changes during the past 2000 years were initiated by European settlement, which produced a vegetation mosaic that today is less clearly tied to landform. Quercus and other hardwood trees declined in abundance in the early settlement period in association with land clearance, whereas Pinus has increased, especially during the past century, through natural reforestation and planting of abandoned fields and pastures. An increase in fossil charcoal following European settlement suggests that fire occurrence has risen substantially as a result of forest clearance and other land uses, reaching levels greater than at any time over the past 2000 years. Although fire was undoubtedly used by Native Americans and may have been locally important, we find no clear evidence that humans extensively modified fire regimes or vegetation before European settlement. Instead, climate change over the past several thousand years and European land use over the past 300 years have been the most important agents of change on this landscape.","Other factors such as storminess, hurricane-force winds (Bosse et al., 2001;Eberhardt et al., 2003) and forest fires (Motzkin et al., 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2003) may have contributed to historic disturbance of this dune landscape.","['The current migration of dunes on Cape Cod is inferred to reflect a legacy of landscape disturbance, specifically forest clear-cutting, grazing and agricultural practices, associated with European settlement starting in the early 17th century and continuing into the 20th century (McCaffrey and Stilgoe, 1981;Rubertone, 1985;Motzkin et al., 2002;Eberhardt et al., 2003;Forman et al., 2008).', 'Other factors such as storminess, hurricane-force winds (Bosse et al., 2001;Eberhardt et al., 2003) and forest fires (Motzkin et al., 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2003) may have contributed to historic disturbance of this dune landscape.', 'Numerous geomorphic studies along coasts of the European North Atlantic implicate increased storminess in the Holocene with the reactivation of coastal dune system (e.g., Clarke and Rendell, 2009;Hansom and Hall, 2009).', 'However, uncertainty remains if periods of increased storminess and/or hurricane landfalls for the exposed Cape Cod spit during the Holocene (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013) were of sufficient magnitude to disturb this forest ecosystem and reactivated dunes.', 'Proxy records of hurricane occurrence from coastal overwash timeseries (e.g., Donnelly et al., 2001;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007) and from marine sediment cores extracted strategically along the Bahama Bank (Williams, 2013) to reflect wave climate indicate heightened hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean between 4900 and 3600, 2500, and 1000, and 600 and 400 years BP (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).']",1,"['Other factors such as storminess, hurricane-force winds (Bosse et al., 2001;Eberhardt et al., 2003) and forest fires (Motzkin et al., 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2003) may have contributed to historic disturbance of this dune landscape.']"

The first estimate is based on a composite of regional sedimentary evidence of landfalling hurricanes, while the second estimate uses a previously published statistical model of Atlantic tropical cyclone activity driven by proxy reconstructions of past climate changes. Both approaches yield consistent evidence of a peak in Atlantic tropical cyclone activity during medieval times (around ad 1000) followed by a subsequent lull in activity.

Location  The study area encompasses the entire peninsula of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA.    Methods  Historical changes in land-use and land-cover across the study region were determined from historical maps and documentary sources. Modern vegetation and soils were sampled and land-use and fire history determined for 352 stratified-random study plots. Ordination and classification were used to assess vegetation variation, and G-tests of independence and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate relationships among individual species distributions, past land-use, surficial landforms and edaphic conditions.    Results  At the scale of this investigation, modern species distributions result from individualistic response to a range of environmental and historical factors, including geography, substrate and disturbance history, especially the pattern of past agricultural activity. The structure or composition of all vegetation types in the region have been shaped by past land-use, fire, or other disturbances, and vegetation patterns will continue to change through time. Conservation efforts aimed at maintaining early successional vegetation types may require intensive management comparable in intensity to the historical disturbances that allowed for their widespread development.","The current migration of dunes on Cape Cod is inferred to reflect a legacy of landscape disturbance, specifically forest clear-cutting, grazing and agricultural practices, associated with European settlement starting in the early 17th century and continuing into the 20th century (McCaffrey and Stilgoe, 1981;Rubertone, 1985;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2002;Eberhardt et al., 2003;Forman et al., 2008).","['The current migration of dunes on Cape Cod is inferred to reflect a legacy of landscape disturbance, specifically forest clear-cutting, grazing and agricultural practices, associated with European settlement starting in the early 17th century and continuing into the 20th century (McCaffrey and Stilgoe, 1981;Rubertone, 1985;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2002;Eberhardt et al., 2003;Forman et al., 2008).', 'Other factors such as storminess, hurricane-force winds (Bosse et al., 2001;Eberhardt et al., 2003) and forest fires (Motzkin et al., 2002;Parshall et al., 2003) may have contributed to historic disturbance of this dune landscape.', 'Numerous geomorphic studies along coasts of the European North Atlantic implicate increased storminess in the Holocene with the reactivation of coastal dune system (e.g., Clarke and Rendell, 2009;Hansom and Hall, 2009).', 'However, uncertainty remains if periods of increased storminess and/or hurricane landfalls for the exposed Cape Cod spit during the Holocene (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013) were of sufficient magnitude to disturb this forest ecosystem and reactivated dunes.', 'Proxy records of hurricane occurrence from coastal overwash timeseries (e.g., Donnelly et al., 2001;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007) and from marine sediment cores extracted strategically along the Bahama Bank (Williams, 2013) to reflect wave climate indicate heightened hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean between 4900 and 3600, 2500, and 1000, and 600 and 400 years BP (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).']",0,"['The current migration of dunes on Cape Cod is inferred to reflect a legacy of landscape disturbance, specifically forest clear-cutting, grazing and agricultural practices, associated with European settlement starting in the early 17th century and continuing into the 20th century (McCaffrey and Stilgoe, 1981;Rubertone, 1985;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2002;Eberhardt et al., 2003;Forman et al., 2008).']"

The lakes were lowest between 10,000 and 9000 and between 5500 and 3000 cal yr B.P. Using a heuristic moisture-budget model, we explore the hypothesis that changes in seasonal precipitation regimes, driven by monotonic trends in ice extent and insolation, plausibly explain the multiple lake-level changes. Simulated lake levels resulting from low summer precipitation rates match observed low lake levels of 10,000-9000 cal yr B.P., whereas a model experiment that simply shifts the seasonality of the modern Massachusetts precipitation regime (i.e., moving the peak monthly precipitation from winter to summer) produces levels that are ~2 m lower than today as observed for 5500-3000 cal yr B.P. The influence of the Laurentide ice sheet could explain dry summers before ca. 8000 cal yr B.P.

This paper begins by laying out the basic principles of the SAR procedure on which the various SAR protocols are based. A general model is examined and three simple performance tests are laid out. Recent experimental characterisation of the optically stimulated luminescence signals from quartz grains is reviewed, giving particular regard to implications for SAR protocols. Various published SAR protocols are presented and discussed, particularly with regard to changes in experimental procedure and methods of data analysis in order to isolate the fast component of the OSL signal. It is concluded that the SAR procedure has proved to be a very powerful approach for determining the equivalent dose using quartz OSL signals dominated by the fast component.

Boose"", ""Kristen E. Chamberlin"", ""David R. Foster""]","Hurricanes are a major factor controlling ecosystem structure, function, and dynamics in many coastal forests, but their ecological role can be understood only by assessing impacts in space and time over a period of centuries. We present a new method for reconstructing hurricane disturbance regimes using a combination of historical research and computer modeling. Historical evidence of wind damage for each hurricane in the selected region is quantified using the Fujita scale to produce regional maps of actual damage. A simple meteorological model (HURRECON), parameterized and tested for selected recent hurricanes, provides regional estimates of wind speed, direction, and damage for each storm. Individual reconstructions are compiled to analyze spatial and temporal patterns of hurricane impacts. Long-term effects of topography on a landscape scale are then simulated with a simple topographic exposure model (EXPOS). We applied this method to the region of New England, USA, examining hurricanes since European settlement in 1620. Results showed strong regional gradients in hurricane frequency and intensity from southeast to northwest: mean return intervals for F0 damage on the Fujita scale (loss of leaves and branches) ranged from 5 to 85 yr, mean return intervals for F1 damage (scattered blowdowns, small gaps) ranged from 10 to .200 yr, and mean return intervals for F2 damage (extensive blowdowns, large gaps) ranged from 85 to .380 yr. On a landscape scale, mean return intervals for F2 damage in the town of Petersham, Massachusetts, ranged from 125 yr across most sites to .380 yr on scattered lee slopes. Actual forest damage was strongly dependent on land use and natural disturbance history. Annual and decadal timing of hurricanes varied widely. There was no clear centuryscale trend in the number of major hurricanes. The historical-modeling approach is applicable to any region with good historical records and will enable ecologists and land managers to incorporate insights on hurricane disturbance regimes into the interpretation and conservation of forests at landscape to regional scales.Organismic and Evolutionary Biolog","Other factors such as storminess, hurricane-force winds (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001;Eberhardt et al., 2003) and forest fires (Motzkin et al., 2002;Parshall et al., 2003) may have contributed to historic disturbance of this dune landscape.","['The current migration of dunes on Cape Cod is inferred to reflect a legacy of landscape disturbance, specifically forest clear-cutting, grazing and agricultural practices, associated with European settlement starting in the early 17th century and continuing into the 20th century (McCaffrey and Stilgoe, 1981;Rubertone, 1985;Motzkin et al., 2002;Eberhardt et al., 2003;Forman et al., 2008).', 'Other factors such as storminess, hurricane-force winds (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001;Eberhardt et al., 2003) and forest fires (Motzkin et al., 2002;Parshall et al., 2003) may have contributed to historic disturbance of this dune landscape.', 'Numerous geomorphic studies along coasts of the European North Atlantic implicate increased storminess in the Holocene with the reactivation of coastal dune system (e.g., Clarke and Rendell, 2009;Hansom and Hall, 2009).', 'However, uncertainty remains if periods of increased storminess and/or hurricane landfalls for the exposed Cape Cod spit during the Holocene (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013) were of sufficient magnitude to disturb this forest ecosystem and reactivated dunes.', 'Proxy records of hurricane occurrence from coastal overwash timeseries (e.g., Donnelly et al., 2001;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007) and from marine sediment cores extracted strategically along the Bahama Bank (Williams, 2013) to reflect wave climate indicate heightened hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean between 4900 and 3600, 2500, and 1000, and 600 and 400 years BP (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).']",0,"['Other factors such as storminess, hurricane-force winds (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001;Eberhardt et al., 2003) and forest fires (Motzkin et al., 2002;Parshall et al., 2003) may have contributed to historic disturbance of this dune landscape.']"

Their establishment may therefore depend on coincidence of chance seed dispersal, favourable weather conditions and low rodent densities. 4 In addition, episodic burial by sand prevents most species from colonizing young dune ridges, while burial of seedlings by litter limits recruitment on older dune ridges with developing forest. The intensity of competition increases during succession. 5 Dune succession is better described as the transient dynamics of colonization and competitive displacement rather than the result of gradual soil development and competitive displacement.","Also, ecologic succession to a climax forest post-disturbance can take centuries (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2000), though trees <20 years old are less susceptible to wind uprooting (Foster, 1988).","['Dune reactivation is associated with large-scale disturbance of the forest which is dominated by pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and a variety of oak species (e.g., Quercus alba, and Quercus coccinea), but white pine (Pinus strobes), red maple (Acer rubrum), hickory (Carya spp.), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia) are locally common (Motzkin et al., 1999;Cogbill et al., 2002).', 'Cape Cod with its limited topographic relief and dominance of pine forests is particularly susceptible to tree blow-down with Fujita scale winds >2 (>181 km/h; cf.', 'Bosse et al., 2001).', 'Tropical storms of hurricane intensity are known to blow down large forest areas along tracks that are 50-100 km in width and extend for 100s of kilometers in New England (Foster et al., 2006, p. 49;Zeng et al., 2009).', 'Specifically, nearly 100% of pine stands older than 20 years were damaged by a hurricane in 1938 that impacted central New England, whereas hardwood stands were less effected (Foster, 1988).', 'The mound and pit mircotopography associated with wind uprooted trees can dominate landscapes.', 'For example, in New Brunswick up to 50% of a forest area post-storm was affected with 600 mounds/acre (Foster and Boose, 1995, p. 323) and such processes have been documented in the past ca.', '1000 years (Foster et al., 2006, p. 49).', 'The pit and mound topography provides fresh grains for eolian transport and initiates ecological succession with pioneer species occupying the mound (cf.', 'Peterson et al., 1990).', 'The recovery of coastal dune systems post-hurricane is also dependent on the frequency of succeeding storms (e.g., Houser, 2013) and thus, dune movement can be sustained with decadal to centennial periods of heightened hurricane/storm reoccurrence (e.g., Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).', 'Also, ecologic succession to a climax forest post-disturbance can take centuries (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2000), though trees <20 years old are less susceptible to wind uprooting (Foster, 1988).', 'Thus, dune migration on Cape Cod may reflect a pronounced period of storm or hurricane-related disturbance of the pine-dominated forest.']",0,"['Also, ecologic succession to a climax forest post-disturbance can take centuries (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2000), though trees <20 years old are less susceptible to wind uprooting (Foster, 1988).', 'Thus, dune migration on Cape Cod may reflect a pronounced period of storm or hurricane-related disturbance of the pine-dominated forest.']"

Foster""]","(1) The effect of catastrophic hurricane wind on forest vegetation in central New England was examined at the species and stand level. (2) Species susceptibility to wind is largely explained by canopy position: fast-growing, pioneer species that form overstorey dominants (Pinus strobus, P. resinosa, Populus spp. and Betula papyrifera) suffered much greater damage than slower growing, or tolerant species occurring primarily in codominant, intermediate and suppressed canopy positions (Carya spp., Acer rubrum, Quercus alba, Q. velutina and Tsuga canadensis). Uprooting was much more important than breakage as the primary form of damage. This result, which contrasts with the findings of most studies of wind damage, may perhaps be explained by the very high levels of precipitation that accompanied the storm, saturating the soil and loosening the roots. (3) Damage to forest stands exhibits a positive, linear relationship with stand age and height and negative relationship with density. Conifer forests are significantly more susceptible than hardwood forests. Pinus strobus and P. resinosa stands are susceptible to wind at 15 years of age and are completely destroyed at 30 years; hardwood stands exhibit increasing damage from age 20 years, but are not completely blown down until age 80-100 years. (4) Within stands, damage shifts progressively from the dominant trees in young stands to include trees in the codominant, intermediate and suppressed layers in older forests. Parallel changes with age in the type of damage include a decline in the number of leaning trees and increase in uprooting. (5) Damage to species and stands from a catastrophic windstorm occurs quite predictably and specifically within the forests studied. This discriminating impact of wind has profound consequences on the vegetation at a range of spatial scales and is largely mediated by historical factors and structural and compositional aspects of the vegetation mosaic.","Specifically, nearly 100% of pine stands older than 20 years were damaged by a hurricane in 1938 that impacted central New England, whereas hardwood stands were less effected (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1988).","['Dune reactivation is associated with large-scale disturbance of the forest which is dominated by pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and a variety of oak species (e.g., Quercus alba, and Quercus coccinea), but white pine (Pinus strobes), red maple (Acer rubrum), hickory (Carya spp.), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia) are locally common (Motzkin et al., 1999;Cogbill et al., 2002).', 'Cape Cod with its limited topographic relief and dominance of pine forests is particularly susceptible to tree blow-down with Fujita scale winds >2 (>181 km/h; cf.', 'Bosse et al., 2001).', 'Tropical storms of hurricane intensity are known to blow down large forest areas along tracks that are 50-100 km in width and extend for 100s of kilometers in New England (Foster et al., 2006, p. 49;Zeng et al., 2009).', 'Specifically, nearly 100% of pine stands older than 20 years were damaged by a hurricane in 1938 that impacted central New England, whereas hardwood stands were less effected (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1988).', 'The mound and pit mircotopography associated with wind uprooted trees can dominate landscapes.', 'For example, in New Brunswick up to 50% of a forest area post-storm was affected with 600 mounds/acre (Foster and Boose, 1995, p. 323) and such processes have been documented in the past ca.', '1000 years (Foster et al., 2006, p. 49).', 'The pit and mound topography provides fresh grains for eolian transport and initiates ecological succession with pioneer species occupying the mound (cf.', 'Peterson et al., 1990).', 'The recovery of coastal dune systems post-hurricane is also dependent on the frequency of succeeding storms (e.g., Houser, 2013) and thus, dune movement can be sustained with decadal to centennial periods of heightened hurricane/storm reoccurrence (e.g., Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).', 'Also, ecologic succession to a climax forest post-disturbance can take centuries (Lichter, 2000), though trees <20 years old are less susceptible to wind uprooting (Foster, 1988).', 'Thus, dune migration on Cape Cod may reflect a pronounced period of storm or hurricane-related disturbance of the pine-dominated forest.']",0,"['Specifically, nearly 100% of pine stands older than 20 years were damaged by a hurricane in 1938 that impacted central New England, whereas hardwood stands were less effected (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1988).']"

Clifford"", ""Robert K. Booth""]","Understanding the role of fire in the Earth system, and particularly regional controls on its frequency and severity, is critical to risk assessment. Charcoal records from lake sediment and fire-scar networks from long-lived tree species have improved our understanding of long-term relationships between fire events and climate. This work has primarily focused on historically fire-prone ecosystems and regions. In the northeastern USA, where wildfire has been relatively infrequent in historical times, fire-risk assessments have incorporated little-to-no pre-historical data and little is known about long-term fire-climate relationships. We developed coupled, high-resolution records of moisture variability and fire from three ombrotrophic peatlands in Maine using testate amoebae and analysis of microscopic charcoal. Water-table depth reconstructions among the three sites were generally coherent, with high-magnitude dry and wet events corresponding within the uncertainty of age-depth models. At all sites, there was a significantly higher probability of fire events during high-magnitude droughts. However, although prolonged droughts were widespread and associated with higher probability of fire, the fire events were rarely synchronous among sites, with the exception of ~550 years before present (yr BP) when all three sites experienced both drought and fire. While fire has been relatively uncommon in the northeastern USA during the past century, our records clearly highlight the potential vulnerability of the region to future drought and fire impacts. Results also demonstrate the utility of coupled records of fire and climate in understanding regional fire-climate dynamics.","Dry conditions in the Northeastern US may be associated with increased forest fire (Parshall et al., 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG and Booth, 2013) and such an ecological disturbance may lead to local landscape degradation.","['Another factor that may influence eolian activity is periodic drought as documented by tree-ring time series that span the past years (e.g., Cook et al., 2014).', 'However, drought in a mesic environment with an average precipitation of ___1000 mm/year may result in ecologic stress and a change in species composition (Parshall et al., 2003), but not usually broad-scale landscape denudation.', 'Dry conditions in the Northeastern US may be associated with increased forest fire (Parshall et al., 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG and Booth, 2013) and such an ecological disturbance may lead to local landscape degradation.', 'Drought conditions on Cape Cod, particularly associated with forest fires may be a contributory factor for increased eolian activity.']",0,"['Dry conditions in the Northeastern US may be associated with increased forest fire (Parshall et al., 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG and Booth, 2013) and such an ecological disturbance may lead to local landscape degradation.']"

There is little evidence of intense hurricane landfalls in the region for several hundred years prior to the late 17th century A.D.

Time series of palynological data provide a 14,000-yr record of regional and local vegetation development, a means for biostratigraphic correlation and dating, and information about changes in water level. Differences in records among cores in the basin show that water level decreased at least 1.5 m between ~10,800 and 9700 cal yr B.P., after which sediment accumulation was slow and intermittent across the basin for about 1700 yr. Between 8000 and 5600 cal yr B.P., water level rose ~2.0 m, after which slow peat accumulation indicates a low stand about the time of the hemlock decline at 5300 +- 200 cal yr B.P. Dry conditions may have continued after this time, but by 3200 cal yr B.P., the onset of peat accumulation in shallow cores indicates that water level had risen to close to its highest postglacial level, where it is today.

Location The New England study area extends across eight physiographic sections, from the Appalachian Mountains to the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The data are drawn from 389 original towns in what are now seven states in the north-eastern United States. These towns have early land division records which document the witness trees growing in the town before European settlement (c. seventeenth to eighteenth century AD). Methods Records of witness trees from presettlement surveys were collated from towns throughout the study area (1.3 * 10 5 km 2 ). Tree abundance was averaged over townwide samples of multiple forest types, integrating proportions of taxa at a local scale (10 2 km 2 ). These data were summarized into genus groups over the sample towns, which were then mapped [geographical information system (GIS)], classified (Cluster Analysis) and ordinated [detrended correspondence analysis (DCA)]. Modern climatic and topographic variables were also derived from GIS analyses for each town and all town attributes were quantitatively compared. Distributions of both individual species and vegetation units were analysed and displayed for spatial analysis of vegetation structure. Results The tally of 153,932 individual tree citations show a dominant latitudinal trend in the vegetation. Spatial patterns are concisely displayed as pie charts of genus composition arrayed on sampled towns.

Historical records indicate that four of these hurricanes (1635, 1638, 1815, and 1938) and hurricane Carol, a strong category 2 storm in 1954, produced significant storm surges (>3 m) in southern Rhode Island. Storm surges of this magnitude can overtop barrier islands, removing sediments from the beach and nearshore environment and depositing overwash fans across back-barrier marshes, lakes, and lagoons. In a regime of rising sea level, accumulation of marsh, lake, or lagoon sediments on top of overwash deposits will preserve a record of overwash deposition.  We examined the record of overwash deposition at Succotash salt marsh in East Matunuck, Rhode Island, and tested the correlation with historical records of intense storms. Aerial photographs taken after hurricanes in 1954 and 1938 show overwash fans deposited at the site. Analysis of 14 sediment cores from the back-barrier marsh confirmed the presence of these fans and revealed that 4 additional large-scale overwash fans were deposited within the marsh sediments.  The four overwash fans deposited since the early seventeenth century at Succotash Marsh matches the historical record of significant hurricane-induced storm surge. These fans were most likely deposited by hurricanes in 1954, 1938, 1815, and either 1638 or 1635. Radiocarbon dating of two prehistoric overwash fans indicated that these were deposited between A.D. 1295- 1407 and 1404-1446 and probably represent intense hurricane strikes. In the past 700 yr, at least 7 intense hurricanes struck the southern Rhode Island coast and produced a storm surge that overtopped the barrier at Succotash Marsh.","Proxy records of hurricane occurrence from coastal overwash timeseries (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007) and from marine sediment cores extracted strategically along the Bahama Bank (Williams, 2013) to reflect wave climate indicate heightened hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean between 4900 and 3600, 2500, and 1000, and 600 and 400 years BP (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).","['The current migration of dunes on Cape Cod is inferred to reflect a legacy of landscape disturbance, specifically forest clear-cutting, grazing and agricultural practices, associated with European settlement starting in the early 17th century and continuing into the 20th century (McCaffrey and Stilgoe, 1981;Rubertone, 1985;Motzkin et al., 2002;Eberhardt et al., 2003;Forman et al., 2008).', 'Other factors such as storminess, hurricane-force winds (Bosse et al., 2001;Eberhardt et al., 2003) and forest fires (Motzkin et al., 2002;Parshall et al., 2003) may have contributed to historic disturbance of this dune landscape.', 'Numerous geomorphic studies along coasts of the European North Atlantic implicate increased storminess in the Holocene with the reactivation of coastal dune system (e.g., Clarke and Rendell, 2009;Hansom and Hall, 2009).', 'However, uncertainty remains if periods of increased storminess and/or hurricane landfalls for the exposed Cape Cod spit during the Holocene (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013) were of sufficient magnitude to disturb this forest ecosystem and reactivated dunes.', 'Proxy records of hurricane occurrence from coastal overwash timeseries (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007) and from marine sediment cores extracted strategically along the Bahama Bank (Williams, 2013) to reflect wave climate indicate heightened hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean between 4900 and 3600, 2500, and 1000, and 600 and 400 years BP (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).']",0,"['Proxy records of hurricane occurrence from coastal overwash timeseries (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007) and from marine sediment cores extracted strategically along the Bahama Bank (Williams, 2013) to reflect wave climate indicate heightened hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean between 4900 and 3600, 2500, and 1000, and 600 and 400 years BP (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).']"

A. Maun"", ""J. Lapierre""]","One of the most obvious features on the foredunes and strands of coasts and lakes is recurrent burial in sand. Burial levels vary in different coastal sand dune systems and influence the physical and biotic microenvironment of the plant and soil. Foredune plants along coasts possess numerous adaptations to withstand burial. Studies show that below a certain threshold level of burial, the growth of all foredune plant species is stimulated probably because of multiple factors, namely improved soil resources, increase in soil volume, reactive plant growth, and enhanced mycorrhizal activity. However, as the level of burial increases, the positive response starts to decline until it becomes a negative value. For example, burial may reduce seed germination, seedling emergence, survival, and growth of seedlings and adult plants. At the community level, burial acts as a filter and selectively eliminates susceptible species, reduces the relative abundance of less tolerant species, and increases the abundance of tolerant and sand-dependent species. However, if sand deposition continues unabated, even the sand-dependent species are eliminated and a bare area is created. The emergence of a plant from a burial deposit primarily depends on the energy reserves in its storage organs and the speed, depth, and frequency of burial. Upon burial the plants shift resources from the belowground to the aboveground parts. Different plants show varied morphological responses to sand accretion. For example, the culms of grasses emerge by an increase in the number of nodes per culm and the elongation of internodes. Similarly, the emergent trunks and woody branches of tolerant trees and shrubs produce new buds and suckers at a higher level on the stem. In response to burial, the coastal sand dune species produce shootborne roots close to the new soil surface probably because of decreased oxygen levels.Key words: sand accretion, adaptations to burial, zonation of vegetation, burial of seeds, plant vigour, impact on communities, modes of emergence.","This common coastal grass thrives where sand accretion rates are 5-40 cm/year (Maun and Lapierre, 1984;#AUTHOR_TAG, 1998;Maun and Perumal, 1999) and on Cape Cod promotes vertical accretion and horizontal extension of parabolic dunes (Forman et al., 2008).","['Inset into these large parabolic forms on outer Cape Cod are smaller blow-out or incipient parabolic dunes, with the lateral transport of sand limited by the ubiquitous occurrence of the pioneering plant species: American beach grass (Ammophila breviligulata).', 'This common coastal grass thrives where sand accretion rates are 5-40 cm/year (Maun and Lapierre, 1984;#AUTHOR_TAG, 1998;Maun and Perumal, 1999) and on Cape Cod promotes vertical accretion and horizontal extension of parabolic dunes (Forman et al., 2008).', 'The viability of beach grass is restricted with burial rates >60 cm/year of eolian sand (cf.', 'Disraeli, 1984;Maun, 1998), resulting in a net reduction in vegetation cover and less impedance of saltation.', 'The kilometer-scale of the larger parabolic forms may reflect sustained ability of American Beach Grass to trap sand as these dunes developed (Luna et al., 2011).']",0,"['This common coastal grass thrives where sand accretion rates are 5-40 cm/year (Maun and Lapierre, 1984;#AUTHOR_TAG, 1998;Maun and Perumal, 1999) and on Cape Cod promotes vertical accretion and horizontal extension of parabolic dunes (Forman et al., 2008).', 'The viability of beach grass is restricted with burial rates >60 cm/year of eolian sand (cf.']"

Foster"", ""Arthur Allen""]","Throughout the eastern United States, plant species distributions and community patterns have developed in re- sponse to heterogeneous environmental conditions and a wide range of historical factors, including complex histories of natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Despite increased rec- ognition of the importance of disturbance in determining forest composition and structure, few studies have assessed the relative influence of current environment and historical factors on moder vegetation, in part because detailed knowl- edge of prior disturbance is often lacking. In the present study, we investigate moder and historical factors that control veg- etation patterns at Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts, USA. Similar to the forested uplands throughout the north- eastern United States, the site is physiographically heteroge- neous and has a long and complex history of natural and anthropogenic disturbance. However, data on forest composi- tion and disturbance history collected over the past > 90 years allow us to evaluate the importance of historical factors rigor- ously, which is rarely possible on other sites. Soil analyses and historical sources document four catego- ries of historical land use on areas that are all forested today: cultivated fields, improved pastures/mowings, unimproved pastures, and continuously forested woodlots. Ordination and logistic regressions indicate that although species have re- sponded individualistically to a wide range of environmental and disturbance factors, many species are influenced by three factors: soil drainage, land use history, and C:N ratios. Few species vary in accordance with ionic gradients, damage from the 1938 hurricane, or a 1957 fire. Contrary to our expectation that the effects of disturbance will diminish over time, histori- cal land use predicts 1992 vegetation composition better than 1937 composition, perhaps because historical woodlots have become increasingly differentiated from post-agricultural","Dune reactivation is associated with large-scale disturbance of the forest which is dominated by pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and a variety of oak species (e.g., Quercus alba, and Quercus coccinea), but white pine (Pinus strobes), red maple (Acer rubrum), hickory (Carya spp.), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia) are locally common (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1999;Cogbill et al., 2002).","['Dune reactivation is associated with large-scale disturbance of the forest which is dominated by pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and a variety of oak species (e.g., Quercus alba, and Quercus coccinea), but white pine (Pinus strobes), red maple (Acer rubrum), hickory (Carya spp.), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia) are locally common (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1999;Cogbill et al., 2002).', 'Cape Cod with its limited topographic relief and dominance of pine forests is particularly susceptible to tree blow-down with Fujita scale winds >2 (>181 km/h; cf.', 'Bosse et al., 2001).', 'Tropical storms of hurricane intensity are known to blow down large forest areas along tracks that are 50-100 km in width and extend for 100s of kilometers in New England (Foster et al., 2006, p. 49;Zeng et al., 2009).', 'Specifically, nearly 100% of pine stands older than 20 years were damaged by a hurricane in 1938 that impacted central New England, whereas hardwood stands were less effected (Foster, 1988).', 'The mound and pit mircotopography associated with wind uprooted trees can dominate landscapes.', 'For example, in New Brunswick up to 50% of a forest area post-storm was affected with 600 mounds/acre (Foster and Boose, 1995, p. 323) and such processes have been documented in the past ca.', '1000 years (Foster et al., 2006, p. 49).', 'The pit and mound topography provides fresh grains for eolian transport and initiates ecological succession with pioneer species occupying the mound (cf.', 'Peterson et al., 1990).', 'The recovery of coastal dune systems post-hurricane is also dependent on the frequency of succeeding storms (e.g., Houser, 2013) and thus, dune movement can be sustained with decadal to centennial periods of heightened hurricane/storm reoccurrence (e.g., Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).', 'Also, ecologic succession to a climax forest post-disturbance can take centuries (Lichter, 2000), though trees <20 years old are less susceptible to wind uprooting (Foster, 1988).', 'Thus, dune migration on Cape Cod may reflect a pronounced period of storm or hurricane-related disturbance of the pine-dominated forest.']",0,"['Dune reactivation is associated with large-scale disturbance of the forest which is dominated by pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and a variety of oak species (e.g., Quercus alba, and Quercus coccinea), but white pine (Pinus strobes), red maple (Acer rubrum), hickory (Carya spp.), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia) are locally common (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1999;Cogbill et al., 2002).', 'Cape Cod with its limited topographic relief and dominance of pine forests is particularly susceptible to tree blow-down with Fujita scale winds >2 (>181 km/h; cf.']"

The beach sands and the sands of the older and younger Wellfleet, Highland and Truro plains have similar mineralogically mature, quartzose compositions. These sands are quartz-arenites to subarkoses with small amounts of glauconite pellets. The complete samples of the combined outwash and beach groups average 89% quartz and 4% feldspar; the medium-sand fractions average 91% quartz and 5% feldspar. The non-opaque, non-micaceous heavy minerals in the medium-sand fraction of the beaches average 42% tourmaline, 16% staurolite, 14% garnet, 13% sillimanite, 5% amphibole, 5% andalusite, and 5% others. Although the proportions of heavy minerals in the outwash sands vary among samples, the average composition is similar to the beach sands: 40% tourmaline, 16% staurolite, 16% sillimanite, 12% garnet, 6% andalusite, 4% amphibole, and 6% others. A common provenance for outwash and beach sands is also reflected in the nearly uniform ratios of color varieties of tourmaline in all samples. Most of the quartzose sand of the beaches and outwash has a long history of recycling from Atlantic coastal-plain strata of Cretaceous to Tertiary age. These sands were entrained by Illinoian (?) glacial ice, which deposited gravel and sand in till and outwash over the Gulf of Maine. Sangamon marine reworking of the surface of these deposits mantled them with glauconitic, quartzose sand and gravel. Wisconsin ice moved southeastward, stripping the floor of the Gulf of Maine down to crystalline rocks and remnants of Cretaceous to Tertiary strata. Melt-water streams flowed southwestward from the South Channel Lobe into lakes, building the outwash plains with quartzose sand and lithic pebbles. The shapes and surfaces of many round, subspherical quartz grains were modified by grinding during transport in the ice, producing conchoidal fractures, flat-edged plate-like fragments, sharp edges, sliver-like chips, and grooves. Subsequent longshore transport of the quartzose sand and lithic pebbles north and south from a nodal zone has somewhat rounded the grains, but has not made the medium-sand fraction more quartzose. The nodal zone is northeast of Wellfleet, as evidenced by an increase in hydraulic equivalent ratios for tourmaline, sillimanite, staurolite, garnet and hornblende north and south along the coast from this location.","The sands analyzed have a SiO content of >90% of the noncarbonate fraction and are predominantly a moderately to well sorted medium to coarse sand with >80% quartz grains, reflecting the mineralogy of underlying Pleistocene outwash, a likely source for the eolian sand (#AUTHOR_TAG and Hubert, 1996).","['The sands analyzed have a SiO content of >90% of the noncarbonate fraction and are predominantly a moderately to well sorted medium to coarse sand with >80% quartz grains, reflecting the mineralogy of underlying Pleistocene outwash, a likely source for the eolian sand (#AUTHOR_TAG and Hubert, 1996).', 'The quartz fraction was isolated by density separations (at 2.55 and 2.70 g/cc) using the heavy liquid Na-polytungstate and a 40-min immersion in HF (40%) was applied to etch the outer ___10 ��m of grains, which is affected by alpha radiation (Mejdahl and Christiansen, 1994).', 'Quartz grains were rinsed finally in HCl (10%) to remove any insoluble fluorides.', 'The purity of quartz separate was evaluated by petrographic inspection and point counting of a representative aliquot.', 'Samples that showed >1% of non-quartz minerals were retreated with HF and rechecked petrographically and sieved again.', 'In addition, the optical purity of quartz separates was tested by exposing aliquots to infrared excitation, which preferentially excites feldspar minerals or feldspathic inclusions (cf.', 'Duller et al., 2003).', 'Aliquots which showed infrared emissions appreciably above background counts (> counts/s) where omitted from equivalent dose calculations.']",1,"['The sands analyzed have a SiO content of >90% of the noncarbonate fraction and are predominantly a moderately to well sorted medium to coarse sand with >80% quartz grains, reflecting the mineralogy of underlying Pleistocene outwash, a likely source for the eolian sand (#AUTHOR_TAG and Hubert, 1996).']"

The winter aeolian process is influenced by the pore ice which binds the sand grains together and increases the surface resistance to wind action. Sublimation of the frozen moisture provides loose grains of sand which subsequently can be entrained by the wind. Field experiments carried out on the Presqu'ile Beach, Ontario in the 1992-1993 winter provide some data on variables which affect sand loss from frozen surfaces because of sublimation. Sand moisture content determines the resistivity of the surface to sublimation-induced sand loss: frozen surfaces with higher moisture contents experience less sand loss. The existing literature has indicated that temperature plays an important role in the occurrence of sublimation: higher temperatures (i.e., temperatures which are closer to 0degC) result in higher rates of sublimation. However, the Presqu'ile experiments show that wind speed is more strongly correlated with sublimation-induced particle loss than temperature or relative humidity. Higher wind speeds allow sand from the surface and sublimation-produced water vapour to be removed from the area, thus providing an incentive for further sublimation and sand loss to take place. Information on the variables which affect sublimation-induced sand loss from frozen surfaces can be used to increase understanding of the processes involved in sand movement on frozen surfaces under subzero temperatures.","Often the presence of snow and interstitial ice binds eolian particles to surfaces necessitating higher threshold shear velocities for transport (Barchyn and Hugenholtz, 2012;Ollerhead et al., 2013), though the sublimation rate may be an important factor in grain release (#AUTHOR_TAG and Law, 1995).","['The most pervasive eolian landforms on outermost Cape Cod are the kilometer-scale parabolic dunes.', 'The orientation these dunes indicates migration from the west to northwest, consistent with the wind drift potential during winter (Figure 2).', 'Eolian transport may dominate during the late fall to early winter with the common exceedance of threshold wind velocities (>5 m/s) for eolian entrainment (Forman et al., 2008).', 'Also, a low vegetation cover and a drier moisture status of the dune landscape in late fall and early winter may enhance further eolian transport (cf.', 'Ollerhead et al., 2013).', 'Often the presence of snow and interstitial ice binds eolian particles to surfaces necessitating higher threshold shear velocities for transport (Barchyn and Hugenholtz, 2012;Ollerhead et al., 2013), though the sublimation rate may be an important factor in grain release (#AUTHOR_TAG and Law, 1995).', 'The presence of snow ramparts and interstitial layers mostly composed of snow can enhance eolian accretion and dune movement (Koster and Dijkmans, 1988;Dijkmans and Mucher, 1989;Ruz and Allard, 1995).', 'Lastly, eolian transport is accelerated during hurricane passage with wind speeds of >50 m/s.', 'Most storm tracks that impact Cape Cod in the 20th century have a trajectory from the southwest to the northeast, with winds shifting from the northwest and west with westward passage of a cyclonic disturbance (Foster and Boose, 1995, p. 309;Motzkin et al., 2002).', 'Local winds associated with the passage of storms may be topographically funneled by the preexisting tall dune forms.']",0,"['Often the presence of snow and interstitial ice binds eolian particles to surfaces necessitating higher threshold shear velocities for transport (Barchyn and Hugenholtz, 2012;Ollerhead et al., 2013), though the sublimation rate may be an important factor in grain release (#AUTHOR_TAG and Law, 1995).', 'The presence of snow ramparts and interstitial layers mostly composed of snow can enhance eolian accretion and dune movement (Koster and Dijkmans, 1988;Dijkmans and Mucher, 1989;Ruz and Allard, 1995).']"

Trenching and coring of a beach ridge plain in southwestern Louisiana revealed six sand beds and one shell bed, interpreted as hurricane washover deposits. The sand beds are readily distinguished from enclosing marsh sediments by their higher sand content, lower organic content and contrasting microfossil assemblages. Based on the modern analogs of hurricanes Audrey (1957), Rita (2005) and Ike (2008), and consideration of nearby landfalling hurricanes in the historical record, it was determined that the storm intensity threshold of the study site is equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane. There is a wide variation in hurricane strike frequency between this site and other sites bordering the Gulf of Mexico. This variation results from differences in site sensitivity and the nature of geologic or geochemical proxies used to derive hurricane strike records. The approach demonstrated by this study could have applicability at other sites around the world where beach ridge plains are subject to tropical cyclone strikes.","Proxy records of hurricane occurrence from coastal overwash timeseries (e.g., Donnelly et al., 2001;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007) and from marine sediment cores extracted strategically along the Bahama Bank (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2013) to reflect wave climate indicate heightened hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean between 4900 and 3600, 2500, and 1000, and 600 and 400 years BP (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).","['The current migration of dunes on Cape Cod is inferred to reflect a legacy of landscape disturbance, specifically forest clear-cutting, grazing and agricultural practices, associated with European settlement starting in the early 17th century and continuing into the 20th century (McCaffrey and Stilgoe, 1981;Rubertone, 1985;Motzkin et al., 2002;Eberhardt et al., 2003;Forman et al., 2008).', 'Other factors such as storminess, hurricane-force winds (Bosse et al., 2001;Eberhardt et al., 2003) and forest fires (Motzkin et al., 2002;Parshall et al., 2003) may have contributed to historic disturbance of this dune landscape.', 'Numerous geomorphic studies along coasts of the European North Atlantic implicate increased storminess in the Holocene with the reactivation of coastal dune system (e.g., Clarke and Rendell, 2009;Hansom and Hall, 2009).', 'However, uncertainty remains if periods of increased storminess and/or hurricane landfalls for the exposed Cape Cod spit during the Holocene (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013) were of sufficient magnitude to disturb this forest ecosystem and reactivated dunes.', 'Proxy records of hurricane occurrence from coastal overwash timeseries (e.g., Donnelly et al., 2001;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007) and from marine sediment cores extracted strategically along the Bahama Bank (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2013) to reflect wave climate indicate heightened hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean between 4900 and 3600, 2500, and 1000, and 600 and 400 years BP (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).']",1,"['Proxy records of hurricane occurrence from coastal overwash timeseries (e.g., Donnelly et al., 2001;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007) and from marine sediment cores extracted strategically along the Bahama Bank (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2013) to reflect wave climate indicate heightened hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean between 4900 and 3600, 2500, and 1000, and 600 and 400 years BP (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).']"

Barchyn"", ""Chris H. Hugenholtz""]","Abstract Changes in surface conditions on cold-climate aeolian dunes are pronounced; during winter dunes are wet, snow covered, and/or frozen for extended periods of time. It is unknown how the critical wind speed for sediment transport (""threshold"") varies and how threshold may influence sediment transport predictions. Although the impact of surface conditions on threshold has been examined in synthetic experiments (wind tunnels), complicated feedbacks between threshold, sand transport, and surface conditions that occur in natural environments suggest that a ground-based empirical approach may provide enhanced insight. In this study we investigate threshold variability for 73 days during fall-winter-spring surface conditions from 18 November 2008 to 30 May 2009 in the Bigstick Sand Hills of Saskatchewan, Canada. Simultaneous measurements of threshold and atmospheric variables (air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and direction) were used to examine the extent to which surface erodibility was regulated by meteorology. Time-lapse images of the surface from a co-located camera were used for quality control and interpreting changes in the surface affecting threshold. Results reveal that threshold varied throughout the deployment (25-75% quartiles: 6.92-8.28 m s- 1; mean: 7.79 m s- 1). Threshold variability was especially evident at two scales: (i) event timescale and (ii) seasonal timescale. Event-scale variability peaked during mid-winter; in one event the threshold varied by 6 m s- 1 in 2 h with freezing and re-freezing of the surface and relatively constant atmospheric conditions. The causes of event-scale variability are complex though qualitatively related to changes of wind direction, antecedent meteorological conditions, and vertical variations of grain-scale bonding agents such as pore ice and moisture. Seasonal-scale changes manifested as an increase in threshold during fall, peaking in mid-winter, and decreasing in spring. Increased threshold in mid-winter was linked to lower insolation and air temperature, suggesting low erodibility due to the presence of pore ice. Correlation coefficients of threshold versus atmospheric variables yielded relatively weak correlations (air temperature: r = - 0.322; relative humidity: r = 0.388; solar radiation: r = - 0.309) that also varied according to wind direction, suggesting that the link between atmospheric conditions and surface erodibility on cold-climate dunes is complex. This contrasts with results from field-based studies in warmer climates and controlled wind tunnel experiments, which show a more direct link between atmospheric variables (temperature and humidity) and surface erodibility. Nevertheless, our results do show a seasonal pattern of threshold that could be important for modeling cold-climate aeolian sediment transport.","Often the presence of snow and interstitial ice binds eolian particles to surfaces necessitating higher threshold shear velocities for transport (#AUTHOR_TAG and Hugenholtz, 2012;Ollerhead et al., 2013), though the sublimation rate may be an important factor in grain release (Vandijk and Law, 1995).","['The most pervasive eolian landforms on outermost Cape Cod are the kilometer-scale parabolic dunes.', 'The orientation these dunes indicates migration from the west to northwest, consistent with the wind drift potential during winter (Figure 2).', 'Eolian transport may dominate during the late fall to early winter with the common exceedance of threshold wind velocities (>5 m/s) for eolian entrainment (Forman et al., 2008).', 'Also, a low vegetation cover and a drier moisture status of the dune landscape in late fall and early winter may enhance further eolian transport (cf.', 'Ollerhead et al., 2013).', 'Often the presence of snow and interstitial ice binds eolian particles to surfaces necessitating higher threshold shear velocities for transport (#AUTHOR_TAG and Hugenholtz, 2012;Ollerhead et al., 2013), though the sublimation rate may be an important factor in grain release (Vandijk and Law, 1995).', 'The presence of snow ramparts and interstitial layers mostly composed of snow can enhance eolian accretion and dune movement (Koster and Dijkmans, 1988;Dijkmans and Mucher, 1989;Ruz and Allard, 1995).', 'Lastly, eolian transport is accelerated during hurricane passage with wind speeds of >50 m/s.', 'Most storm tracks that impact Cape Cod in the 20th century have a trajectory from the southwest to the northeast, with winds shifting from the northwest and west with westward passage of a cyclonic disturbance (Foster and Boose, 1995, p. 309;Motzkin et al., 2002).', 'Local winds associated with the passage of storms may be topographically funneled by the preexisting tall dune forms.']",0,"['Often the presence of snow and interstitial ice binds eolian particles to surfaces necessitating higher threshold shear velocities for transport (#AUTHOR_TAG and Hugenholtz, 2012;Ollerhead et al., 2013), though the sublimation rate may be an important factor in grain release (Vandijk and Law, 1995).', 'The presence of snow ramparts and interstitial layers mostly composed of snow can enhance eolian accretion and dune movement (Koster and Dijkmans, 1988;Dijkmans and Mucher, 1989;Ruz and Allard, 1995).']"

Water and the activity of organisms, mainly plants, modify the first few centimeters of the parent materials through a series of processes that favor the differentiation of horizons and the development of a soil profile through the incorporation and translocation of materials and some transformations that occur within the soil.

There is evidence of periods of increased storminess during the Little Ice Age (LIA) (AD 1570-1990), and archival records show that these periods are also associated with sand movement in coastal areas. Independent evidence of sand movement during the LIA is derived from dating the coastal sand deposits, using luminescence or radiocarbon methods. The Holocene record of sand drift in western Europe includes episodes corresponding to periods of Northern Hemisphere cooling, particularly at 8.2 ka, and provides the additional evidence that these periods, like the LIA, were also stormy.","Numerous geomorphic studies along coasts of the European North Atlantic implicate increased storminess in the Holocene with the reactivation of coastal dune system (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG and Rendell, 2009;Hansom and Hall, 2009).","['The current migration of dunes on Cape Cod is inferred to reflect a legacy of landscape disturbance, specifically forest clear-cutting, grazing and agricultural practices, associated with European settlement starting in the early 17th century and continuing into the 20th century (McCaffrey and Stilgoe, 1981;Rubertone, 1985;Motzkin et al., 2002;Eberhardt et al., 2003;Forman et al., 2008).', 'Other factors such as storminess, hurricane-force winds (Bosse et al., 2001;Eberhardt et al., 2003) and forest fires (Motzkin et al., 2002;Parshall et al., 2003) may have contributed to historic disturbance of this dune landscape.', 'Numerous geomorphic studies along coasts of the European North Atlantic implicate increased storminess in the Holocene with the reactivation of coastal dune system (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG and Rendell, 2009;Hansom and Hall, 2009).', 'However, uncertainty remains if periods of increased storminess and/or hurricane landfalls for the exposed Cape Cod spit during the Holocene (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013) were of sufficient magnitude to disturb this forest ecosystem and reactivated dunes.', 'Proxy records of hurricane occurrence from coastal overwash timeseries (e.g., Donnelly et al., 2001;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007) and from marine sediment cores extracted strategically along the Bahama Bank (Williams, 2013) to reflect wave climate indicate heightened hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean between 4900 and 3600, 2500, and 1000, and 600 and 400 years BP (Mann et al., 2009;Toomey et al., 2013).']",4,"['Numerous geomorphic studies along coasts of the European North Atlantic implicate increased storminess in the Holocene with the reactivation of coastal dune system (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG and Rendell, 2009;Hansom and Hall, 2009).']"

Here, the tree-ring-derived North American Drought Atlas is used to investigate drought variability in four regions over the last millennium, focusing on pan-continental droughts. During the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), the central plains (CP), Southwest (SW), and Southeast (SE) regions experienced drier conditions and increased occurrence of droughts and the Northwest (NW) experienced several extended pluvials. Enhanced MCA aridity in the SW and CP manifested as multidecadal megadroughts. Notably, megadroughts in these regions differed in their timing and persistence, suggesting that they represent regional events influenced by local dynamics rather than a unified, continental-scale phenomena. There is no trend in pan-continental drought occurrence, definedassynchronousdroughtsinthreeormoreregions.SW,CP,andSE(SW1CP1SE)droughtsarethemost common, occurring in 12% of all years and peaking in prevalence during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; patterns involving three other regions occur in about 8% of years. Positive values of the Southern Oscillation index (La Ni~ conditions) are linked to SW, CP, and SE (SW1CP1SE) droughts and SW, CP, and NW (SW1CP1NW) droughts, whereas CP, NW, and SE (CP1NW1SE) droughts are associated with positive values of the Pacific decadal oscillation and Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. While relatively rare, pancontinental droughts are present in the paleo record and are linked to defined modes of climate variability, implying the potential for seasonal predictability. Assuming stable drought teleconnections, these events will remain an important feature of future North American hydroclimate, possibly increasing in their severity in step with other expected hydroclimate responses to increased greenhouse gas forcing.","Another factor that may influence eolian activity is periodic drought as documented by tree-ring time series that span the past years (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014).","['Another factor that may influence eolian activity is periodic drought as documented by tree-ring time series that span the past years (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014).', 'However, drought in a mesic environment with an average precipitation of ___1000 mm/year may result in ecologic stress and a change in species composition (Parshall et al., 2003), but not usually broad-scale landscape denudation.', 'Dry conditions in the Northeastern US may be associated with increased forest fire (Parshall et al., 2003;Clifford and Booth, 2013) and such an ecological disturbance may lead to local landscape degradation.', 'Drought conditions on Cape Cod, particularly associated with forest fires may be a contributory factor for increased eolian activity.']",4,"['Another factor that may influence eolian activity is periodic drought as documented by tree-ring time series that span the past years (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014).']"

Koster"", ""Jos W. A. Dijkmans""]","The concept of a 'niveo-aeolian influence' on the genesis of northwest European Pleistocene aeolian sand and loess deposits has been advocated in the past both to explain the presence and the absence of lamination. Field experiments were carried out on artificially deposited alternating layers of sand and snow, and of loess and snow, to investigate the role of a niveo-aeolian mode of deposition on resulting sedimentary structures.        Field observations of sand plots revealed minor changes in surface morphology typical of denivation surfaces. The thin sections showed a characteristic porous structure. Deformations of the depositional structure and indications for erosion and redeposition were limited. However, the originally smooth aeolian sedimentary surface of the loess changed considerably. The thin sections showed also a porous, spongy structure. Indications were found for disturbances by frost action, liquefaction during melting of the snow and ice, and redeposition of loess by meltwater.        The experimental results strongly suggest that sand and loess deposited as niveo-aeolian material are characterized both by a porous structure, and that the original sedimentary structure of the sand is not affected by snowmelt, whereas loess becomes non-laminated. Thus, the intercalation of snow during sedimentation of sand and loess does not in itself induce a laminated structure.","The presence of snow ramparts and interstitial layers mostly composed of snow can enhance eolian accretion and dune movement (Koster and Dijkmans, 1988;#AUTHOR_TAG and Mucher, 1989;Ruz and Allard, 1995).","['The most pervasive eolian landforms on outermost Cape Cod are the kilometer-scale parabolic dunes.', 'The orientation these dunes indicates migration from the west to northwest, consistent with the wind drift potential during winter (Figure 2).', 'Eolian transport may dominate during the late fall to early winter with the common exceedance of threshold wind velocities (>5 m/s) for eolian entrainment (Forman et al., 2008).', 'Also, a low vegetation cover and a drier moisture status of the dune landscape in late fall and early winter may enhance further eolian transport (cf.', 'Ollerhead et al., 2013).', 'Often the presence of snow and interstitial ice binds eolian particles to surfaces necessitating higher threshold shear velocities for transport (Barchyn and Hugenholtz, 2012;Ollerhead et al., 2013), though the sublimation rate may be an important factor in grain release (Vandijk and Law, 1995).', 'The presence of snow ramparts and interstitial layers mostly composed of snow can enhance eolian accretion and dune movement (Koster and Dijkmans, 1988;#AUTHOR_TAG and Mucher, 1989;Ruz and Allard, 1995).', 'Lastly, eolian transport is accelerated during hurricane passage with wind speeds of >50 m/s.', 'Most storm tracks that impact Cape Cod in the 20th century have a trajectory from the southwest to the northeast, with winds shifting from the northwest and west with westward passage of a cyclonic disturbance (Foster and Boose, 1995, p. 309;Motzkin et al., 2002).', 'Local winds associated with the passage of storms may be topographically funneled by the preexisting tall dune forms.']",0,"['The presence of snow ramparts and interstitial layers mostly composed of snow can enhance eolian accretion and dune movement (Koster and Dijkmans, 1988;#AUTHOR_TAG and Mucher, 1989;Ruz and Allard, 1995).']"

The production of 14C in the atmosphere varies through time due to changes in the Earth's geomagnetic field intensity and in its concentration, which is regulated by the carbon cycle.

Dunefield activity is modeled as a cyclic phenomenon, alternating between active and stable states, with the latter as the system state attractor. The model is divided into two constituent parts: an activation model and a stabilization model. The activation model is qualitative and describes the transition from stable to active dunes as the result of a climatic perturbation such as drought that decreases vegetation cover. The intensity and duration of the climatic perturbation determines the rate of decline of vegetation cover. The stabilization model is quantitative and describes the transition from active to stable dunes using a logistic model of vegetation growth.

CC2078,1441362,Social Memory and Ritual Performance,Rick Peterson,Non Monumental Burial in Britain a Largely Cavernous View,"[""R Schulting""]","While long barrows and chambered tombs have long received most of the attention of British Neolithic archaeologists investigating mortuary practices, it is clear that there were a variety of different depositional contexts for the remains of the dead at this time. Other kinds of monuments, and in particular causewayed enclosures, seem to have played an important role in funerary behaviour. But other, less immediately recognisable places also feature. More flat graves are being identified through the application of AMS dating to burials lacking diagnostic grave goods. A number of human remains recovered from river contexts have also been shown in recent years to fall within the Neolithic Period, raising the possibility in some instances of river 'burial'. But, at least quantitatively, the most important alternative burial location to monuments is without question deposition in caves. Again, it is the increasingly routine use of AMS dating that is raising awareness of the number of Neolithic human remains from caves. In many cases there appear to be parallels in how the skeleton is treated in caves and monuments, such as the deposition of both articulated and disarticulated remains, and the manipulation of skeletal elements. The significance of these different burial locations remains poorly understood, but there are some clear lines of inquiry that can be explored. Foremost is the need to document the full extent of cave burial in the Neolithic through the instigation of systematic dating programmes. This can then provide the basis for a comparison of the demographic and health profiles of groups interred in caves and in monuments. Preliminary stable isotope results from South Wales suggest that the long-term diets of individuals differed significantly between these two burial contexts, intimating the existence of considerable socioeconomic differentiation in Neolithic Britain.","Human remains occur over a long timescale at many prehistoric cave sites, particularly from the Neolithic onwards (Chamberlain, 1996;Dowd, 2008;Leach, 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007).","['This article addresses the question of how group memory is transmitted within societies.', 'What are the effects of remembering collectively and how might we understand that process using archaeological evidence?', 'These questions arose from fieldwork in small caves and rock shelters at Goldsland Wood, Wenvoe (Aldhouse-Green and Peterson, 2007;Peterson and Aldhouse-Green, in prep.) in the Vale of Glamorgan in Wales (Figure 1).', 'Human remains occur over a long timescale at many prehistoric cave sites, particularly from the Neolithic onwards (Chamberlain, 1996;Dowd, 2008;Leach, 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007).', 'One of the Goldsland sites, George Rock Shelter, has fragmented human remains which have been radiocarbon dated to the beginning of the Neolithic period.', 'Wolf Cave, around 200 m away, has similarly fragmented human remains but in this case with radiocarbon dates from the Early Bronze Age.', 'At both sites there were also Neolithic pottery sherds, worked stone tools and debitage of Late Mesolithic to Late Neolithic date.']",0,"['Human remains occur over a long timescale at many prehistoric cave sites, particularly from the Neolithic onwards (Chamberlain, 1996;Dowd, 2008;Leach, 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007).']"

The origins of these artefacts suggest there was an active gift exchange taking place between the S‡mi hunters and Finno_Ugrian settlers to the east, in the context of the fur trade. The presence of wealth objects in sacrificial sites is interpreted as a form of ÒpotlatchÓ, i.e. the result of decisions by local groups (sijdda) to preserve social stability by removing from the society the possibility for an accumulation of wealth and prestige. This interpretation is consistent with the archaeological evidence of settlement patterns, seasonal mobility and a lack of social hierarchy in the interior of northern Sweden. Rituals at sacrificial sites thus helped to maintain a S‡mi hunting society that was based on religious principles of animal ceremonialism, social principles of general reciprocity, and an economy centred on cooperative activities, despite the potential of the fur trade to disrupt this society, for example by enhancing the prestige of successful individuals. In this way the egalitarian character of the S‡mi sijdda was maintained right up until the transition to reindeer pastoralism in the 16th_nth centuries.",The details of this ritual performance are brought out by #AUTHOR_TAG (1996) in a study of Sa��mi communities around the Lule River in northern Sweden between 700 and 1400 AD.,"['The details of this ritual performance are brought out by #AUTHOR_TAG (1996) in a study of Sa��mi communities around the Lule River in northern Sweden between 700 and 1400 AD.', ""In this area shrines are located at distinctive natural features within the landscape and contain either siejdde stones or wooden figures, both of which represent divine 'masters of the animals', central figures in the animistic Sa��mi religion (1996: 52)."", 'Shrines were particularly associated with the winter settlements of these mobile hunter-fisher communities, which were also the locations for most of the social interaction within the wider Sa��mi group and for trade with agricultural communities to the south (1996: 64).']",5,['The details of this ritual performance are brought out by #AUTHOR_TAG (1996) in a study of Sa��mi communities around the Lule River in northern Sweden between 700 and 1400 AD.']

Apes, Language and the Human Mind. Oxford University Press, Oxford) is profitably read in the terms of the theoretical perspective developed in Clark (1997. Being There, Putting Brain, Body and World Together Again. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA). The former work details some striking results concerning chimpanzee and bonobo subjects, trained to make use of keyboards containing 'lexigram' symbols. The authors, though, make heavy going of a critique of what they take to be standard approaches to understanding language and cognition in animals, and fail to offer a worthwhile theoretical position from which to make sense of their own data.

Hofstadter""]","An effective single-band Hamiltonian representing a crystal electron in a uniform magnetic field is constructed from the tight-binding form of a Bloch band by replacingÊ _ _ k by the operatorÊ _ p _ e _ A c. The resultant Schršdinger equation becomes a finite-difference equation whose eigenvalues can be computed by a matrix method. The magnetic flux which passes through a lattice cell, divided by a flux quantum, yields a dimensionless parameter whose rationality or irrationality highly influences the nature of the computed spectrum. The graph of the spectrum over a wide range of ""rational"" fields is plotted. A recursive structure is discovered in the graph, which enables a number of theorems to be proven, bearing particularly on the question of continuity. The recursive structure is not unlike that predicted by Azbel', using a continued fraction for the dimensionless parameter. An iterative algorithm for deriving the clustering pattern of the magnetic subbands is given, which follows from the recursive structure. From this algorithm, the nature of the spectrum at an ""irrational"" field can be deduced; it is seen to be an uncountable but measure-zero set of points (a Cantor set). Despite these-features, it is shown that the graph is continuous as the magnetic field varies. It is also shown how a spectrum with simplified properties can be derived from the rigorously derived spectrum, by introducing a spread in the field values. This spectrum satisfies all the intuitively desirable properties of a spectrum. The spectrum here presented is shown to agree with that predicted by A. Rauh in a completely different model for crystal electrons in a magnetic field. A new type of magnetic ""superlattice"" is introduced, constructed so that its unit cell intercepts precisely one quantum of flux. It is shown that this cell represents the periodicity of solutions of the difference equation. It is also shown how this superlattice allows the determination of the wave function at nonlattice sites. Evidence is offered that the wave functions belonging to irrational fields are everywhere defined and are continuous in this model, whereas those belonging to rational fields are only defined on a discrete set of points.

Feld"", ""R. Saers"", ""A. Widera"", ""T. M\u00fcller"", ""I. Bloch""]","Tunnelling of material particles through a classically impenetrable barrier constitutes one of the hallmark effects of quantum physics. When interactions between the particles compete with their mobility through a tunnel junction, intriguing novel dynamical behaviour can arise where particles do not tunnel independently. In single-electron or Bloch transistors, for example, the tunnelling of an electron or Cooper pair can be enabled or suppressed by the presence of a second charge carrier due to Coulomb blockade. Here we report on the first direct and time-resolved observation of correlated tunnelling of two interacting atoms through a barrier in a double well potential. We show that for weak interactions between the atoms and dominating tunnel coupling, individual atoms can tunnel independently, similar to the case in a normal Josephson junction. With strong repulsive interactions present, two atoms located on one side of the barrier cannot separate, but are observed to tunnel together as a pair in a second order co-tunnelling process. By recording both the atom position and phase coherence over time, we fully characterize the tunnelling process for a single atom as well as the correlated dynamics of a pair of atoms for weak and strong interactions. In addition, we identify a conditional tunnelling regime, where a single atom can only tunnel in the presence of a second particle, acting as a single atom switch. Our work constitutes the first direct observation of second order tunnelling events with ultracold atoms, which are the dominating dynamical effect in the strongly interacting regime. Similar second-order processes form the basis of superexchange interactions between atoms on neighbouring lattice sites of a periodic potential, a central component of quantum magnetism.Comment: 18 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in Natur","In this paper, we extend the JZ proposal and discuss a new scheme based on an optical superlattice [25,#AUTHOR_TAG] to generate a gauge potential leading to (1).","['Although the existing proposals for implementing the Harper Hamiltonian with atomic quantum gases open many avenues, they are still challenging from an experimental point of view (for reasons discussed in detail below).', 'In this paper, we extend the JZ proposal and discuss a new scheme based on an optical superlattice [25,#AUTHOR_TAG] to generate a gauge potential leading to (1).', 'At variance with earlier works where alkali atoms were considered, we propose here to use atoms with a long-lived metastable excited state, such as alkaline-earth [27,28,29] or Ytterbium [30,31] atoms.', 'For concreteness we will discuss the case of Ytterbium, for which degenerate gases have already been produced for both bosonic and fermionic isotopes [30,31].', 'We take advantage of this level structure to alleviate many practical difficulties encountered The light-shift experienced by the atoms is ��(�_)|E| 2 /2, with |E| the electric field strength at wavelength �_.', 'Two particular wavelengths are of special interest, a ""magic"" wavelength �_ m ___ 760 nm and an ""anti-magic"" wavelength �_ am ___ 1.12 ��m.', '(c) Sketch of the atomic configuration in a state-dependent optical lattice, showing the two interlaced sublattices for g (grey dots) and e (black dots) atoms.', 'The y lattice is formed by a standing wave at the ""magic"" wavelength and confines both states identically.', 'The x lattice is tuned near the ""anti-magic"" wavelength and confines the two states in two distinct sublattices shifted by �_ am /4. with alkalis.', 'Importantly, our scheme uses only building blocks which have already been individually demonstrated.']",2,"['Although the existing proposals for implementing the Harper Hamiltonian with atomic quantum gases open many avenues, they are still challenging from an experimental point of view (for reasons discussed in detail below).', 'In this paper, we extend the JZ proposal and discuss a new scheme based on an optical superlattice [25,#AUTHOR_TAG] to generate a gauge potential leading to (1).', 'At variance with earlier works where alkali atoms were considered, we propose here to use atoms with a long-lived metastable excited state, such as alkaline-earth [27,28,29] or Ytterbium [30,31] atoms.']"

Cooper""]","This article reviews developments in the theory of rapidly rotating degenerate atomic gases. The main focus is on the equilibrium properties of a single component atomic Bose gas, which (at least at rest) forms a Bose-Einstein condensate. Rotation leads to the formation of quantized vortices which order into a vortex array, in close analogy with the behaviour of superfluid helium. Under conditions of rapid rotation, when the vortex density becomes large, atomic Bose gases offer the possibility to explore the physics of quantized vortices in novel parameter regimes. First, there is an interesting regime in which the vortices become sufficiently dense that their cores -- as set by the healing length -- start to overlap. In this regime, the theoretical description simplifies, allowing a reduction to single particle states in the lowest Landau level. Second, one can envisage entering a regime of very high vortex density, when the number of vortices becomes comparable to the number of particles in the gas. In this regime, theory predicts the appearance of a series of strongly correlated phases, which can be viewed as {\it bosonic} versions of fractional quantum Hall states. This article describes the equilibrium properties of rapidly rotating atomic Bose gases in both the mean-field and the strongly correlated regimes, and related theoretical developments for Bose gases in lattices, for multi-component Bose gases, and for atomic Fermi gases. The current experimental situation and outlook for the future are discussed in the light of these theoretical developments.Comment: Published version + minor correction",Analogous quantum Hall phases should also arise in cold atomic gases when they are set into fast rotation (see #AUTHOR_TAG and references therein).,"['The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) phases realized by two-dimensional electron gases in very large magnetic fields are among the most intriguing states of matter (see, for instance, [1]).', 'In such systems, electrons ""bind"" to magnetic vortices, forming strongly correlated phases with striking properties, such as exotic excitations (""anyons"") which obey fractional statistics [2].', 'Analogous quantum Hall phases should also arise in cold atomic gases when they are set into fast rotation (see #AUTHOR_TAG and references therein).', 'Due to the mathematical similarity between Coriolis and Lorentz forces, rotating neutral gases are indeed the exact analogue of an assembly of charged particles plunged in a magnetic field.', 'Observing these highly correlated phases is one of the major goals in the field of trapped quantum gases [3,4].', 'This goal has, however, not yet been reached, because of the difficulty of communicating the required amount of angular momentum (on the order of N per atom, with N the number of particles) to the system [5,6].', 'In practice, the residual static trap anisotropy limits the total angular momentum to much smaller values, for which the rotating gas is well described by a mean field approach [7].']",0,['Analogous quantum Hall phases should also arise in cold atomic gases when they are set into fast rotation (see #AUTHOR_TAG and references therein).']

With the realistic sinusoidal optical potential, the flat bands acquire a finite but much smaller band width compared to the dispersive bands. The band flatness dramatically enhanced interaction effects giving rise to various charge and bond ordered states at commensurate fillings ofÊ n= i 6 (i=1_6). AtÊn=1/6, the many-body ground states can be exactly solved as the close packed hexagon states which can be stabilized even in the weak interacting regime. The dimerization of bonding strength occurs at bothÊ n=1/2 and 5/6, and the latter case is accompanied with the charge density wave of holes. The trimerization of bonding strength and charge inhomogeneity appear atÊ n=1/3,2/3.

Clark""]","Motivated by the possibility of creating non-Abelian fields using cold atoms in optical lattices, we explore the richness and complexity of noninteracting two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in a lattice, subjected to such fields. In the continuum limit, a non-Abelian system characterized by a two-component ``magnetic flux'' describes a harmonic oscillator existing in two different charge states (mimicking a particle-hole pair) where the coupling between the states is determined by the non-Abelian parameter, namely, the difference between the two components of the ``magnetic flux.'' A key feature of the non-Abelian system is a splitting of the Landau energy levels, which broaden into bands, as the spectrum depends explicitly on the transverse momentum. These Landau bands result in a coarse-grained ``moth,'' a continuum version of the generalized Hofstadter butterfly. Furthermore, the bands overlap, leading to effective relativistic effects. Importantly, similar features also characterize the corresponding two-dimensional lattice problem when at least one of the components of the magnetic flux is an irrational number. The lattice system with two competing ``magnetic fluxes'' penetrating the unit cell provides a rich environment in which to study localization phenomena. Some unique aspects of the transport properties of the non-Abelian system are the possibility of inducing localization by varying the quasimomentum, and the absence of localization of certain zero-energy states exhibiting a linear energy-momentum relation. Furthermore, non-Abelian systems provide an interesting localization scenario where the localization transition is accompanied by a transition from relativistic to nonrelativistic theory.","Combined with interatomic interactions, an entirely new class of superfluid or strongly correlated systems becomes accessible with ultracold atoms [34,53,63,#AUTHOR_TAG,65].","['In this article, we have discussed how to implement Abelian artificial gauge potentials for Yb (or alkaline-earth) atoms, a scheme valid for bosons and fermions alike.', 'In contrast to the bosonic isotopes with zero total spin, fermionic isotopes have nuclear spin.', 'This potentially enables to simulate non-Abelian gauge fields, along the lines proposed by Osterloh et al.

The dichotomy originates from the symmetry of the quantum mechanical wave function to the interchange of two identical particles. In systems that are confined to two spatial dimensions particles that are neither fermions nor bosons, coined ""anyons"", may exist. The fractional quantum Hall effect offers an experimental system where this possibility is realized. In this paper we present the concept of anyons, we explain why the observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect almost forces the notion of anyons upon us, and we review several possible ways for a direct observation of the physics of anyons. Furthermore, we devote a large part of the paper to non-abelian anyons, motivating their existence from the point of view of trial wave functions, giving a simple exposition of their relation to conformal field theories, and reviewing several proposals for their direct observation.Comment: Invited review for the Annals of Physic","In such systems, electrons ""bind"" to magnetic vortices, forming strongly correlated phases with striking properties, such as exotic excitations (""anyons"") which obey fractional statistics #AUTHOR_TAG.","['The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) phases realized by two-dimensional electron gases in very large magnetic fields are among the most intriguing states of matter (see, for instance, [1]).', 'In such systems, electrons ""bind"" to magnetic vortices, forming strongly correlated phases with striking properties, such as exotic excitations (""anyons"") which obey fractional statistics #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Analogous quantum Hall phases should also arise in cold atomic gases when they are set into fast rotation (see [3] and references therein).', 'Due to the mathematical similarity between Coriolis and Lorentz forces, rotating neutral gases are indeed the exact analogue of an assembly of charged particles plunged in a magnetic field.', 'Observing these highly correlated phases is one of the major goals in the field of trapped quantum gases [3,4].', 'This goal has, however, not yet been reached, because of the difficulty of communicating the required amount of angular momentum (on the order of N per atom, with N the number of particles) to the system [5,6].', 'In practice, the residual static trap anisotropy limits the total angular momentum to much smaller values, for which the rotating gas is well described by a mean field approach [7].']",4,"['In such systems, electrons ""bind"" to magnetic vortices, forming strongly correlated phases with striking properties, such as exotic excitations (""anyons"") which obey fractional statistics #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Analogous quantum Hall phases should also arise in cold atomic gases when they are set into fast rotation (see [3] and references therein).']"

These generalizations are algebraic structures in which the two entries Lie bracket has been replaced by a bracket with n entries. Each type of n-ary bracket satisfies a specific characteristic identity which plays the r\^ole of the Jacobi identity for Lie algebras. Particular attention will be paid to generalized Lie algebras, which are defined by even multibrackets obtained by antisymmetrizing the associative products of its n components and that satisfy the generalized Jacobi identity (GJI), and to Filippov (or n-Lie) algebras, which are defined by fully antisymmetric n-brackets that satisfy the Filippov identity (FI). Three-Lie algebras have surfaced recently in multi-brane theory in the context of the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson model. Because of this, Filippov algebras will be discussed at length, including the cohomology complexes that govern their central extensions and their deformations (Whitehead's lemma extends to all semisimple n-Lie algebras). When the skewsymmetry of the n-Lie algebra is relaxed, one is led the n-Leibniz algebras. These will be discussed as well, since they underlie the cohomological properties of n-Lie algebras.   The standard Poisson structure may also be extended to the n-ary case.

In general, a classical solution in a tensor model may be physically regarded as a background space, and small fluctuations about the solution as emergent fields on the space. The numerical analyses of the tensor models possessing Gaussian classical background solutions have shown that the low-lying long-wavelength fluctuations around the backgrounds are in one-to-one correspondence with the geometric fluctuations on flat spaces in the general relativity. It has also been shown that part of the orthogonal symmetry of the tensor model spontaneously broken by the backgrounds can be identified with the local translation symmetry of the general relativity. Thus the tensor model provides an interesting model of simultaneous emergence of space, the general relativity, and its local gauge symmetry of translation.Comment: 15pages, 5 figures, based on the proceedings of VIII International   Workshop, ""Lie Theory and its Applications in Physics"", Varna, 15 - 21 June   2009, and of XXV Max Born Symposium, ``The Planck Scale'', Wroclaw, 29 June -   3 July 200","This idea has first been presented in Ref. 18, and the subsequent studies mainly in numerical methods have supported the validity of this basic idea [19][20][21][22][23]#AUTHOR_TAG[25][26] .","['The simplest choice of a tensor model is to consider one which has a tensor with three indices as its only dynamical variable.', 'Then, by identifying the rank-three tensor with the structure constant of an algebra charactering a fuzzy space, the tensor model can be interpreted as theory of a dynamical fuzzy space.', 'Since one can in principle choose the values of the rank-three tensor to construct fuzzy spaces corresponding to any dimensional spaces, the rank-three tensor models can equally treat spaces in general dimensions.', 'This idea has first been presented in Ref. 18, and the subsequent studies mainly in numerical methods have supported the validity of this basic idea [19][20][21][22][23]#AUTHOR_TAG[25][26] .', 'The purpose of the present paper is to provide a full treatment of the original incomplete presentation of the idea, and to pursue the algebraic description of the tensor models.', 'In the sequel, it is found that 3-ary algebras [27][28][29] describe the symmetries of the tensor models.', '3-ary algebras have been introduced in physics by Nambu , and have recently been widely discussed in the context of M-theory [31][32][33] .', 'This unexpected common appearance of 3-ary algebras suggests the general Tensor models and 3-ary algebras importance of this new way of describing symmetry in the physics of quantum spacetime.', 'This paper is organized as follows.', 'In the following section, the rank-three tensor model is presented.', 'In Section III, the structure of the algebras corresponding to the rank-three tensor models is discussed.', 'In Section IV, the commutative case of the algebras is discussed.']",0,"['The simplest choice of a tensor model is to consider one which has a tensor with three indices as its only dynamical variable.', 'Then, by identifying the rank-three tensor with the structure constant of an algebra charactering a fuzzy space, the tensor model can be interpreted as theory of a dynamical fuzzy space.', 'This idea has first been presented in Ref. 18, and the subsequent studies mainly in numerical methods have supported the validity of this basic idea [19][20][21][22][23]#AUTHOR_TAG[25][26] .', 'The purpose of the present paper is to provide a full treatment of the original incomplete presentation of the idea, and to pursue the algebraic description of the tensor models.', 'In the sequel, it is found that 3-ary algebras [27][28][29] describe the symmetries of the tensor models.', '3-ary algebras have been introduced in physics by Nambu , and have recently been widely discussed in the context of M-theory [31][32][33] .', 'This unexpected common appearance of 3-ary algebras suggests the general Tensor models and 3-ary algebras importance of this new way of describing symmetry in the physics of quantum spacetime.']"

It has recently been shown that the low-lying fluctuations around the Gaussian background solutions in the tensor model agree correctly with the metric fluctuations on the flat spaces with general dimensions in the general relativity. This suggests that the local gauge symmetry (the symmetry of local translations) is also emergent around these solutions. To systematically study this possibility, I apply the BRS gauge fixing procedure to the tensor model. The ghost kinetic term is numerically analyzed, and it has been found that there exist some massless trajectories of ghost modes, which are clearly separated from the other higher ghost modes. Comparing with the corresponding BRS gauge fixing in the general relativity, these ghost modes forming the massless trajectories in the tensor model are shown to be identical to the reparametrization ghosts in the general relativity.","This idea has first been presented in Ref. 18, and the subsequent studies mainly in numerical methods have supported the validity of this basic idea [19][20][21][22]#AUTHOR_TAG[24][25][26] .","['The simplest choice of a tensor model is to consider one which has a tensor with three indices as its only dynamical variable.', 'Then, by identifying the rank-three tensor with the structure constant of an algebra charactering a fuzzy space, the tensor model can be interpreted as theory of a dynamical fuzzy space.', 'Since one can in principle choose the values of the rank-three tensor to construct fuzzy spaces corresponding to any dimensional spaces, the rank-three tensor models can equally treat spaces in general dimensions.', 'This idea has first been presented in Ref. 18, and the subsequent studies mainly in numerical methods have supported the validity of this basic idea [19][20][21][22]#AUTHOR_TAG[24][25][26] .', 'The purpose of the present paper is to provide a full treatment of the original incomplete presentation of the idea, and to pursue the algebraic description of the tensor models.', 'In the sequel, it is found that 3-ary algebras [27][28][29] describe the symmetries of the tensor models.', '3-ary algebras have been introduced in physics by Nambu , and have recently been widely discussed in the context of M-theory [31][32][33] .', 'This unexpected common appearance of 3-ary algebras suggests the general Tensor models and 3-ary algebras importance of this new way of describing symmetry in the physics of quantum spacetime.', 'This paper is organized as follows.', 'In the following section, the rank-three tensor model is presented.', 'In Section III, the structure of the algebras corresponding to the rank-three tensor models is discussed.', 'In Section IV, the commutative case of the algebras is discussed.']",0,"['The simplest choice of a tensor model is to consider one which has a tensor with three indices as its only dynamical variable.', 'Then, by identifying the rank-three tensor with the structure constant of an algebra charactering a fuzzy space, the tensor model can be interpreted as theory of a dynamical fuzzy space.', 'This idea has first been presented in Ref. 18, and the subsequent studies mainly in numerical methods have supported the validity of this basic idea [19][20][21][22]#AUTHOR_TAG[24][25][26] .', 'The purpose of the present paper is to provide a full treatment of the original incomplete presentation of the idea, and to pursue the algebraic description of the tensor models.', 'In the sequel, it is found that 3-ary algebras [27][28][29] describe the symmetries of the tensor models.', '3-ary algebras have been introduced in physics by Nambu , and have recently been widely discussed in the context of M-theory [31][32][33] .', 'This unexpected common appearance of 3-ary algebras suggests the general Tensor models and 3-ary algebras importance of this new way of describing symmetry in the physics of quantum spacetime.']"

In this paper, I perform more detailed numerical analysis of the properties of the modes for two-dimensional fuzzy tori, and obtain conclusive evidences for the agreement. Under a proposed correspondence between the rank-three tensor in tensor models and the metric tensor in the general relativity, conclusive agreement is obtained between the profiles of the low-lying modes in a tensor model and the metric modes transverse to the general coordinate transformation. Moreover, the low-lying modes are shown to be well on a massless trajectory with quartic momentum dependence in the tensor model. This is in agreement with that the lowest momentum dependence of metric fluctuations in the general relativity will come from the R^2-term, since the R-term is topological in two dimensions. These evidences support the idea that the low-lying low-momentum dynamics around the Gaussian solutions of tensor models is described by the general relativity. I also propose a renormalization procedure for tensor models. A classical application of the procedure makes the patterns of the low-lying spectra drastically clearer, and suggests also the existence of massive trajectories.Comment: 31 pages, 8 figures, Added references, minor corrections, a   misleading figure replace","This idea has first been presented in Ref. 18, and the subsequent studies mainly in numerical methods have supported the validity of this basic idea [19][20]#AUTHOR_TAG[22][23][24][25][26] .","['The simplest choice of a tensor model is to consider one which has a tensor with three indices as its only dynamical variable.', 'Then, by identifying the rank-three tensor with the structure constant of an algebra charactering a fuzzy space, the tensor model can be interpreted as theory of a dynamical fuzzy space.', 'Since one can in principle choose the values of the rank-three tensor to construct fuzzy spaces corresponding to any dimensional spaces, the rank-three tensor models can equally treat spaces in general dimensions.', 'This idea has first been presented in Ref. 18, and the subsequent studies mainly in numerical methods have supported the validity of this basic idea [19][20]#AUTHOR_TAG[22][23][24][25][26] .', 'The purpose of the present paper is to provide a full treatment of the original incomplete presentation of the idea, and to pursue the algebraic description of the tensor models.', 'In the sequel, it is found that 3-ary algebras [27][28][29] describe the symmetries of the tensor models.', '3-ary algebras have been introduced in physics by Nambu , and have recently been widely discussed in the context of M-theory [31][32][33] .', 'This unexpected common appearance of 3-ary algebras suggests the general Tensor models and 3-ary algebras importance of this new way of describing symmetry in the physics of quantum spacetime.', 'This paper is organized as follows.', 'In the following section, the rank-three tensor model is presented.', 'In Section III, the structure of the algebras corresponding to the rank-three tensor models is discussed.', 'In Section IV, the commutative case of the algebras is discussed.']",0,"['The simplest choice of a tensor model is to consider one which has a tensor with three indices as its only dynamical variable.', 'Then, by identifying the rank-three tensor with the structure constant of an algebra charactering a fuzzy space, the tensor model can be interpreted as theory of a dynamical fuzzy space.', 'This idea has first been presented in Ref. 18, and the subsequent studies mainly in numerical methods have supported the validity of this basic idea [19][20]#AUTHOR_TAG[22][23][24][25][26] .', 'The purpose of the present paper is to provide a full treatment of the original incomplete presentation of the idea, and to pursue the algebraic description of the tensor models.', 'In the sequel, it is found that 3-ary algebras [27][28][29] describe the symmetries of the tensor models.']"

In this paper, this previous proposal is applied to dynamical generation of commutative nonassociative fuzzy spaces. It is numerically shown that fuzzy flat torus and fuzzy spheres of various dimensions are classical solutions of the rank-three tensor model. Since these solutions are obtained for the same coupling constants of the tensor model, the cosmological constant and the dimensions are not fundamental but can be regarded as dynamical quantities. The symmetry of the model under the general linear transformation can be identified with a fuzzy analog of the general coordinate transformation symmetry in general relativity. This symmetry of the tensor model is broken at the classical solutions.

In this study, the effects of methylphenidate on more complex aspects of cognition were studied using tasks from the CANTAB battery and related tests which have been shown to be sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction. Twenty-eight young healthy men participated in a counterbalanced, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of methylphenidate. Cognitive assessment included tests of spatial working memory, planning, verbal fluency, attentional set-shifting and sustained attention. Methylphenidate had significant effects on performance of the tests of spatial working memory and planning but not on the attentional and fluency tests. When the drug was taken on the first test session, performance on the spatial tests was enhanced by the drug compared to placebo. However, when the drug was taken second, performance accuracy was impaired whereas response latencies were decreased. These results are consistent with a hypothesis that methylphenidate influences performance in two conflicting ways; enhancing executive aspects of spatial function on novel tasks but impairing previously established performance. This pattern of effects is discussed within the framework of dual, interacting arousal mechanisms.","Deviations from these optimal levels, including increases of local tonic dopamine concentrations and dopamine turnover, lead to impaired striatal and cortical mechanisms underlying working memory, sensory discrimination, and planning (Murphy et al., 1996;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1997;Liu et al., 2008), which may underlie the working memory deficits seen in drug abusers (Ornstein et al., 2000).","['Major drugs of addiction such as cocaine, amphetamine, morphine, heroine, nicotine, and ethanol act on glutamatergic synapses on midbrain dopamine neurons and lead to NMDAdependent, AMPA-mediated long-term potentiation in dopamine neurons (Figure 1A) (Ungless et al., 2001;Saal et al., 2003).', 'Thus excitatory influences on these neurons become enhanced (Figure 1B), in particular NMDA-dependent burst firing (Zweifel et al., 2009).', 'Amphetamine leads also to reduction of long-term depression in dopamine neurons (Figure 1C) (Jones et al., 2000).', 'Thus subthreshold fluctuations of excitatory inputs to dopamine neurons would increase or even generate action potentials in the absence of reward, generating a false reward signal.', 'Phasic Striatal Dopamine Changes Electrical stimulation of dopamine neurons mimicking natural dopamine responses to reward induces striatal dopamine release.', 'Systemically administered cocaine or amphetamine enhances the stimulus-induced dopamine increase by blocking the reuptake transporter (Figure 1D) (Jones et al., 1995;Gonon, 1997;Venton et al., 2003).', 'Thus, cocaine further exaggerates the striatal dopamine changes following an excitatory dopamine signal that is already enhanced, or falsely generated, by synaptic plasticity at dopamine input synapses.', 'Tonic Striatal Dopamine Levels Addictive drugs increase the tonic concentration of striatal dopamine by various mechanisms (Di Chiara and Imperato, 1988).', 'Opiates and nicotine enhance the tonic firing of midbrain dopa-mine neurons (morphine: Matthews and German 1984;Johnson and North, 1992;nicotine: Lichtensteiger et al., 1982;Pidoplichko et al., 1997), although depressant effects may occur (Bonci and Malenka, 1999).', 'Cocaine and amphetamine block reuptake transport, which enhances tonic dopamine concentrations despite suppressed dopamine neuron firing (Bunney et al., 1973).', 'It is well known that tonic dopamine concentrations are finely regulated within postsynaptic brain areas (Chesselet, 1984).', 'Deviations from these optimal levels, including increases of local tonic dopamine concentrations and dopamine turnover, lead to impaired striatal and cortical mechanisms underlying working memory, sensory discrimination, and planning (Murphy et al., 1996;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1997;Liu et al., 2008), which may underlie the working memory deficits seen in drug abusers (Ornstein et al., 2000).', 'Thus through their effects on tonic dopamine levels, drugs may impair striatal and cortical mechanisms beyond reward processing.', '(C) Blockade of long-term depression in ventral tegmental dopamine neurons in vitro by bath application of amphetamine.', 'From Jones et al.

The role of prediction errors is directly demonstrated by the observation that learning is blocked when the stimulus is paired with a fully predicted reward. By using this blocking procedure, we show that the responses of dopamine neurons to conditioned stimuli was governed differentially by the occurrence of reward prediction errors rather than stimulus-reward associations alone, as was the learning of behavioural reactions. Both behavioural and neuronal learning occurred predominantly when dopamine neurons registered a reward prediction error at the time of the reward. Our data indicate that the use of analytical tests derived from formal behavioural learning theory provides a powerful approach for studying the role of single neurons in learning.","Stimuli not associated with prediction errors are blocked from behavioral and neuronal learning (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001).","['Most dopamine neurons are activated by rewards and rewardpredicting stimuli.', 'The reward response codes a prediction error; a reward that is better than predicted elicits an activation (positive prediction error, R > V), a fully predicted reward (R = V) draws no response, and a reward that is worse than predicted induces a depression (negative error, R < V) (Figure 2A) (Schultz et al., 1997).', 'The response implements the teaching term of efficient reinforcement learning models (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972;Sutton and Barto, 1981) and occurs during learning (Schultz et al., 1993;Hollerman and Schultz, 1998).', 'Stimuli not associated with prediction errors are blocked from behavioral and neuronal learning (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001).']",0,"['Most dopamine neurons are activated by rewards and rewardpredicting stimuli.', 'Stimuli not associated with prediction errors are blocked from behavioral and neuronal learning (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001).']"

These excitatory responses increase as the reward value increases. This response property has led to a hypothesis that dopamine neurons encode value-related signals and are inhibited by aversive events. Here we show that this is true only for a subset of dopamine neurons. We recorded the activity of dopamine neurons in monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during a Pavlovian procedure with appetitive and aversive outcomes (liquid rewards and airpuffs directed at the face, respectively). We found that some dopamine neurons were excited by reward-predicting stimuli and inhibited by airpuff-predicting stimuli, as the value hypothesis predicts. However, a greater number of dopamine neurons were excited by both of these stimuli, inconsistent with the hypothesis. Some dopamine neurons were also excited by both rewards and airpuffs themselves, especially when they were unpredictable. Neurons excited by the airpuff-predicting stimuli were located more dorsolaterally in the substantia nigra pars compacta, whereas neurons inhibited by the stimuli were located more ventromedially, some in the ventral tegmental area. A similar anatomical difference was observed for their responses to actual airpuffs. These findings suggest that different groups of dopamine neurons convey motivational signals in distinct manners.","Generalization in the first component of dopamine responses occurs with neutral stimuli (Schultz and Romo, 1990;Waelti et al., 2001), aversive stimuli (Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1996;Joshua et al., 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG and Hikosaka, 2009), explicit nonreward predicting stimuli (conditioned inhibitors; Tobler et al., 2003), and delay-predicting stimuli (Kobayashi and Schultz, 2008).","['The capacity to discriminate between different rewards is important for selecting the most valuable reward during decision making.', 'Reward discrimination is limited by two processes, namely stimulus generalization, which is due to physical similarity between stimuli, and pseudoconditioning, which occurs via context conditioning by primary reinforcers (Mackintosh, 1974;Sheafor, 1975).', 'The activating dopamine responses to stimuli consist of two components.', 'The initial component is prone to generalization and thus discriminates poorly, whereas the second component distinguishes well between differently rewarded stimuli (Figure 2B).', 'Generalization in the first component of dopamine responses occurs with neutral stimuli (Schultz and Romo, 1990;Waelti et al., 2001), aversive stimuli (Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1996;Joshua et al., 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG and Hikosaka, 2009), explicit nonreward predicting stimuli (conditioned inhibitors; Tobler et al., 2003), and delay-predicting stimuli (Kobayashi and Schultz, 2008).', 'Substantial fractions of dopamine neurons are activated by physically salient stimuli (Ljungberg et al., 1992), although these responses seem to be largely due to pseudoconditioning (Kobayashi and Schultz, 2010).', ""The initial, ''false,'' generalized or pseudoconditioned activation is often followed by a depressant response that may not entirely cancel the effects of the activation."", 'Thus stimulus generalization may lead to net striatal dopamine release with neutral stimuli (Day et al., 2007 (B) Generalization of phasic activating population response from reward predicting stimulus (gray) to explicit no-reward predicting stimulus (black; conditioned inhibitor).', 'The shorter and smaller activations to the conditioned inhibitor are partly offset by depressions.', 'Similar generalizing activations are seen with unrewarded stimuli in up to 50% of dopamine neurons (Waelti et al., 2001;Tobler et al., 2003).', 'Data from Tobler et al.

METHODS EEG feedback training was performed in the patient's home (clinic), supervised from a distant laboratory with the help of a 'telemonitoring system'. Online feedback computation was based on single-trial analysis and classification of specific band power features of the spontaneous EEG. Task-related changes in brain oscillations over the course of training steps was investigated by quantifying time-frequency maps of event-related (de-)synchronization (ERD/ERS).   RESULTS The patient learned to 'produce' two distinct EEG patterns, beta band ERD during movement imagery vs. no ERD during relaxing, and to use this for BCI-controlled spelling. Significant learning progress was found as a function of training session, resulting in an average accuracy level of 70% (correct responses) for letter selection. 'Copy spelling' was performed with a rate of approximately one letter per min.   CONCLUSIONS The proposed BCI training procedure, based on electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback and concomitant adaptation of feature extraction and classification, may improve actual levels of communication ability in locked-in patients.

Mieke E. van de Sandt\u2010Koenderman"", ""Jiska Wiegers"", ""Sandra M. Wielaert"", ""Hugo J. Duivenvoorden"", ""Gerard M. Ribbers""]","Background: Increasingly, computerised communication aids are used by people with severe, chronic aphasia. Although the candidacy for these devices is relatively unknown, it has been hypothesised that cognitive deficits have a negative impact on the functional use of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). Deficits of executive functioning are assumed to be particularly important, but other functions, such as memory and semantic processing, may also be relevant. In a previous study (van de Sandt-Koenderman, Wiegers, Wielaert, Duivenvoorden, & Ribbers, in press) we reported the functional effect of TouchSpeak (TS), a computerised communication aid, in a group of stroke patients with severe aphasia. The successful participants showed different levels of proficiency. Some were able to use the system independently and creatively in many situations, some used it independently for trained situations, and others remained partner dependent in using TS. Aims: To find factors associated with the functional success of TS in people with severe aphasia, focusing on memory, executive functioning, semantic processing, and communication skills. Methods & Procedures: The data of 30 patients with severe aphasia were analysed retrospectively. All were trained to use TS in two self-chosen communicative situations. Four outcome levels were differentiated: no use, dependent use, independent use, and extensive use of TS. Pre-training assessment included memory, executive functioning, semantic processing, and communication skills. The four outcome groups were compared regarding age, time post onset, gender, and aphasia type. The role of the cognitive variables was analysed with univariate ANCOVAs with contrast analysis, with correction for age, gender, aphasia type, or time post onset in case of significant differences between the groups on these variables. Outcomes & Results: Seven participants were classified as extensive users of TS, five were independent TS users, and five were partner dependent. In 13 cases there was no functional use of TS. Extensive users were younger than the other outcome groups. Independent of this age effect, there was an effect of semantic processing; the no-use group scored significantly lower on semantics than all other groups. Conclusions: Only a minority of patients with severe aphasia may be expected to become independent, flexible users of high-tech AAC. The finding that functional success was related to semantic processing is clinically important. Prospective studies are needed to support the predictive value of semantic processing for high-tech AAC use. The importance of intact executive functioning is not supported in this study. The broad concept of ""executive functioning"" needs to be studied in more detail in relation to aphasia.",The only study evaluating a VOCA intervention #AUTHOR_TAG investigated the use of TouchSpeak TM in 30 people with severe aphasia following cerebrovascular accidents.,"['The most commonly reported adult client group was use of high-tech AAC in people with aphasia resulting from a variety of non-progressive causes (14 studies) with all but one using computer software interventions.', 'The largest group concerned aphasia resulting from a cerebrovascular accident.', 'The only study evaluating a VOCA intervention #AUTHOR_TAG investigated the use of TouchSpeak TM in 30 people with severe aphasia following cerebrovascular accidents.', 'Following the intervention 13 participants had no functional usage of the device, 5 were dependent users, were independent users and 7 were extensive users.', 'Another paper [14] outlined use of the SentenceShaper To Go TM portable device and found benefits in terms of the number of correctly used words and in the fluency of retelling a message.', 'Evaluations of the SentenceShaper TM program [15][16][17] describe gains in narrative production, however, with little carry-over to spontaneous use.', 'Four further papers [18][19][20][21] found positive outcomes with people who have aphasia, including gains in formal language assessments and grammatical structures.', 'A single paper [22] described less beneficial outcomes from software interventions, reporting varying success in use of the C-Speak TM Aphasia program.']",2,"['The most commonly reported adult client group was use of high-tech AAC in people with aphasia resulting from a variety of non-progressive causes (14 studies) with all but one using computer software interventions.', 'The only study evaluating a VOCA intervention #AUTHOR_TAG investigated the use of TouchSpeak TM in 30 people with severe aphasia following cerebrovascular accidents.']"

In this work, we analyze a well-defined loop system detected in a time-resolved observation in several spectral bands to study how far one can go in characterizing the loop structure and evolution. Methods. The dataset includes simultaneous sequences of images in the 171 u 195 u and 284 u filter bands of TRACE, and in one filter of Yohkoh/SXT, with a time coverage of about 2.5 hours, and two rasters taken with SoHO/CDS in twelve relevant lines, forming between log T  5.4 (O V 629 u and log T  6.4 (Fe XVI 360 u The loop is initially best visible in the TRACE 195 u filter band, with some correspondence with the simultaneous SXT images, and later in the 171 u filter band, with good correspondence with the CDS raster images in the lines with formation temperature around log T  6.0 6.1. We have taken as pixel-by-pixel background the latest TRACE, Yohkoh and CDS images where the loop has faded out. We examine the loop morphology evolution, the light curves, the TRACE filter ratio distribution and evolution, the images and emission measure from the CDS spectral lines. Results. Our analysis detects that, after background subtraction, the emission along the loop and its evolution are non-uniform, especially in the 171 u filter band, and that the TRACE 195/171 filter ratio has a moderately non-uniform distribution along the loop and evolves in time. Both the light curves and the filter ratio evolution indicate a globally cooling loop. Relatively hot plasma may be present at the beginning while, during the first CDS raster, the data indicate a rather moderate thermal structuring of the loop. Conclusions. Our data analysis supports a coherent scenario across the different bands and instruments, points out difficulties in diagnostic methods and puts quantitative basis for detailed forward modeling.","The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics, such as the passband and the point response function: it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue (e.g., Del Zanna and #AUTHOR_TAG and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;Terzo and Reale, 2010).","['The problem of diagnostics of loop plasma from filter ratios, and, more in general, the whole analysis of loop observations, are made even more difficult by the invariable presence of other structures intersecting along the line of sight.', 'A uniform diffuse background emission also affects the temperature diagnostics, by adding systematic offsets that alter the filter ratio values.', 'The task of subtracting this ""background emission"" from the measured emission is non-trivial and can seriously bias the results of the whole analysis.', 'This problem emerged dramatically when the analysis of the same large loop structure observed with Yohkoh/SXT on the solar limb led to three Living Reviews in Solar Physics http://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4', 'different results depending mostly on the different ways to treat the background (Priest et al., 2000;Aschwanden et al., 2001;Reale, 2002a).', 'The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics, such as the passband and the point response function: it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue (e.g., Del Zanna and #AUTHOR_TAG and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;Terzo and Reale, 2010).', 'The problem can be mitigated if one analyzes loops as far as possible isolated from other loops, but this is not easy, for instance, in active regions.', 'If this is not the case, broadband filters may also include contamination from many structures at relatively different temperature and make the analysis of single loops harder.', 'The problem of background subtraction in loop analysis has been addressed by several authors, who apply different subtraction ranging from simple offset, to emission in nearby pixels or subregions, to values interpolated between the loop sides, to whole images at times when the loop is no longer (or not yet) visible (Testa et al., 2002;Del Zanna and Mason, 2003;Schmelz et al., 2003;Aschwanden and Nightingale, 2005;Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;Terzo and Reale, 2010).']",5,"['The problem of diagnostics of loop plasma from filter ratios, and, more in general, the whole analysis of loop observations, are made even more difficult by the invariable presence of other structures intersecting along the line of sight.', 'A uniform diffuse background emission also affects the temperature diagnostics, by adding systematic offsets that alter the filter ratio values.', 'The task of subtracting this ""background emission"" from the measured emission is non-trivial and can seriously bias the results of the whole analysis.', 'This problem emerged dramatically when the analysis of the same large loop structure observed with Yohkoh/SXT on the solar limb led to three Living Reviews in Solar Physics http://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4', 'The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics, such as the passband and the point response function: it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue (e.g., Del Zanna and #AUTHOR_TAG and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;Terzo and Reale, 2010).']"

We derive new diagnostics from the analysis of the rise and peak phase of stellar flares. We release the assumption of full equilibrium of the flaring loop at the flare peak, according to the frequently observed delay between the temperature and the density maximum. From scaling laws and hydrodynamic simulations we derive diagnostic formulas as a function of observable quantities and times. We obtain a diagnostic toolset related to the rise phase, including the loop length, density and aspect ratio. We discuss the limitations of this approach and find that the assumption of loop equilibrium in the analysis of the decay leads to a moderate overestimate of the loop length.

Klimchuk""]","The radiative signatures of the nanoflare model for coronal heating are investigated. If an observed coronal loop is assumed to consist of many small strands that cannot be distinguished spatially by EUV or X-ray observations, we are able to calculate differential emission-measure profiles and filling factors for a range of heating models. In this picture the strands undergo continual heating and cooling, leading to a corona comprising strands with a broad range of temperatures and densities. Thus, observations over a range of temperatures will show a multithermal coronal structure. The cyclical heating-cooling leads inevitably to loops that are underdense and overdense at high and low temperatures, respectively, compared to what would be expected from static equilibrium models, and in addition, we show that differential emission-measure profiles with shallow slopes can be obtained, as reported in recent observations. The differences between filling factors that can be seen by broadband and narrowband instruments are explored. Loops with broadband filling factors near unity can still have small narrowband factors, and the narrowband factor is shown to be a strong function of the local temperature. Nanoflare energy distributions that are constant, flat, or power laws are considered. Power laws lead to wide distributions of temperatures and densities in the corona, and steep power laws lead to larger filling factors.","Studies based both on models and on analysis of observations independently suggest that elementary loop components should be very fine with typical cross-sections of the strands on the order of 10 -100 km (Beveridge et al., 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG and Klimchuk, 2004;Vekstein, 2009).","['It has been long claimed that coronal loops consist of bundles of thin strands, to scales below the instrumental resolution (e.g., G�_mez et al., 1993).', 'The issue of fine loop structure is of critical importance because it constrains the elementary processes that determine the loop ignition.', 'The task to investigate this substructuring is not easy.', 'Studies based both on models and on analysis of observations independently suggest that elementary loop components should be very fine with typical cross-sections of the strands on the order of 10 -100 km (Beveridge et al., 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG and Klimchuk, 2004;Vekstein, 2009).', 'First limited evidence of fine structuring was the low filling factor inferred for loops observed with NIXT (Di Matteo et al., 1999, see Section 3.3.2).', 'The high spatial resolution achieved by the TRACE normal-incidence telescope allowed to address the transverse structure of the imaged coronal loops.', 'EUV images visibly show that coronal loops are substructured (Figure 5).']",4,"['It has been long claimed that coronal loops consist of bundles of thin strands, to scales below the instrumental resolution (e.g., G_mez et al., 1993).', 'The issue of fine loop structure is of critical importance because it constrains the elementary processes that determine the loop ignition.', 'Studies based both on models and on analysis of observations independently suggest that elementary loop components should be very fine with typical cross-sections of the strands on the order of 10 -100 km (Beveridge et al., 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG and Klimchuk, 2004;Vekstein, 2009).']"

In particular we concentrate on the 1 MK loops, best seen in the TRACE EUV 173 _passband. These are high-lying structures which can remain stable over timescales of hours to days. We present simultaneous observations of off-limb active region 1 MK loops performed with TRACE (173 _and 195 _bands) and the SOHO-CDS. The CDS spectral capabilities complement the TRACE observations well and allow an in-depth study of the plasma properties. Some important new results are presented here. In terms of cross-field characteristics, we find that these loops are isothermal and much cooler ( K) than the surrounding diffuse high-lying active region emission ( K). We show that the diffuse background-foreground constitutes the bulk of the high-lying quiescent active region emission. We explain some of the discrepancies found by various authors (based on SOHO and TRACE observations) with an overestimation of loop temperatures and densities. This was caused by inaccurate or neglected background subtraction in the data analysis. We studied the leg of a 1 MK loop and found that along its length temperatures and densities have steeper profiles compared to those derived from previous studies based on TRACE observations. The observations are consistent with an element abundance FIP effect of about 4, filling factors close to unity, and a constant density across the loop. We find a remarkable consistency between the CDS and TRACE observations, although we also find severe limitations to the use of TRACE diagnostic techniques.","The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics, such as the passband and the point response function: it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG and Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;Terzo and Reale, 2010).","['The problem of diagnostics of loop plasma from filter ratios, and, more in general, the whole analysis of loop observations, are made even more difficult by the invariable presence of other structures intersecting along the line of sight.', 'A uniform diffuse background emission also affects the temperature diagnostics, by adding systematic offsets that alter the filter ratio values.', 'The task of subtracting this ""background emission"" from the measured emission is non-trivial and can seriously bias the results of the whole analysis.', 'This problem emerged dramatically when the analysis of the same large loop structure observed with Yohkoh/SXT on the solar limb led to three Living Reviews in Solar Physics http://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4', 'different results depending mostly on the different ways to treat the background (Priest et al., 2000;Aschwanden et al., 2001;Reale, 2002a).', 'The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics, such as the passband and the point response function: it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG and Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;Terzo and Reale, 2010).', 'The problem can be mitigated if one analyzes loops as far as possible isolated from other loops, but this is not easy, for instance, in active regions.', 'If this is not the case, broadband filters may also include contamination from many structures at relatively different temperature and make the analysis of single loops harder.', 'The problem of background subtraction in loop analysis has been addressed by several authors, who apply different subtraction ranging from simple offset, to emission in nearby pixels or subregions, to values interpolated between the loop sides, to whole images at times when the loop is no longer (or not yet) visible (Testa et al., 2002;Del Zanna and Mason, 2003;Schmelz et al., 2003;Aschwanden and Nightingale, 2005;Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;Terzo and Reale, 2010).']",5,"['The problem of diagnostics of loop plasma from filter ratios, and, more in general, the whole analysis of loop observations, are made even more difficult by the invariable presence of other structures intersecting along the line of sight.', 'A uniform diffuse background emission also affects the temperature diagnostics, by adding systematic offsets that alter the filter ratio values.', 'The task of subtracting this ""background emission"" from the measured emission is non-trivial and can seriously bias the results of the whole analysis.', 'This problem emerged dramatically when the analysis of the same large loop structure observed with Yohkoh/SXT on the solar limb led to three Living Reviews in Solar Physics http://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4', 'different results depending mostly on the different ways to treat the background (Priest et al., 2000;Aschwanden et al., 2001;Reale, 2002a).', 'The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics, such as the passband and the point response function: it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG and Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;Terzo and Reale, 2010).', 'The problem can be mitigated if one analyzes loops as far as possible isolated from other loops, but this is not easy, for instance, in active regions.', 'If this is not the case, broadband filters may also include contamination from many structures at relatively different temperature and make the analysis of single loops harder.', 'The problem of background subtraction in loop analysis has been addressed by several authors, who apply different subtraction ranging from simple offset, to emission in nearby pixels or subregions, to values interpolated between the loop sides, to whole images at times when the loop is no longer (or not yet) visible (Testa et al., 2002;Del Zanna and Mason, 2003;Schmelz et al., 2003;Aschwanden and Nightingale, 2005;Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;Terzo and Reale, 2010).']"

We explain this as evidence of fine multi-temperature structure of coronal loops. To this end, we model bundles of loops made of thin strands, each heated by short and intense heat pulses. For simplicity, we assume that the heat pulses are all equal and triggered only once in each strand at a random time. The pulse intensity and cadence are selected so as to have steady active region loops (_3 MK) on average. We compute the evolution of the confined heated plasma with a hydrodynamic loop model. We then compute the emission along each strand in several spectral lines, from cool (_1 MK), to warm (2Ð3 MK) lines, detectable with Hinode/Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer, to hot X-ray lines. The strands are then put side by side to construct an active region loop bundle. We find that in the warm lines (2Ð3 MK) the loop emission fills all the available image surface. Therefore, the emission appears quite uniform and it is difficult to resolve the single loops, while in the cool lines the loops are considerably more contrasted and the region is less fuzzy. The main reasons for this effect are that, during their evolution, i.e., pulse heating and slow cooling, each strand spends a relatively long time at temperatures around 2Ð3 MK and it has a high emission measure during that phase, so the whole region appears more uniform or smudged.

Since the loop geometry is practically unchanged during the brightening, the evolution of the plasma confined in the loop is described with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic time-dependent numerical model, and from the results the emission along the loop in the TRACE 171 A band is synthesized. The information from Paper I is used to derive the geometry and the initial configuration of the loop as well as for comparison with the results of the model. The modeling is focused to determine the amount, spatial distribution, and evolution of the heating deposited in the loop to make the modeled evolution close to that observed with TRACE. We find that, in order to match the observed evolution and distribution of the brightness along the loop, the heating has to be nonsymmetrical in the loop, in particular, deposited between the apex and one footpoint (3 x 109 cm from the southern footpoint). A reasonable match with observations is obtained by assuming that the heating is switched on abruptly and then kept constant for the whole rising phase. An even better match is obtained with the heating high and constant for 100 s and then decaying exponentially with an e-folding time of 300 s. We discuss the resulting physical scenario; a bright irregular structure close to the loop in the TRACE images may be a tracer of the heating release.","The brightening of a single coronal loop was analyzed in detail in an observation of more than 2 hours with a cadence of about 30 s (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2000a).","['Variability analyses were conducted also on warm loops present in TRACE data.', 'The brightening of a single coronal loop was analyzed in detail in an observation of more than 2 hours with a cadence of about 30 s (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2000a).', 'The loop brightens from the footpoints to the top, allowing for detailed hydrodynamic modeling (Reale et al., 2000b, see also Section 4.4).', 'Active region transient events, i.e., short-lived brightenings in small-scale loops, detected over a neutral line in a region of emerging flux were interpreted as reconnection events associated with flux emergence (Seaton et al., 2001).', 'Apparent shrinking and expansion of brightening warm loops suggested heating and cooling of different concentric strands, leading to coronal rain visible in the H line (Shimojo et al., 2002, see also Section 3.2.2).', ""Plasma condensations in hot and warm loops were detected also in the analysis of line intensity and velocity in temporal series data from SoHO/CDS (O'Shea et al., 2007)."", 'Antiochos et al.

CC2207,81800077,Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma,Fabio Reale,A Fluxâ€Tube Tectonics Model for Solar Coronal Heating Driven by the Magnetic Carpet,"[""E. R. Priest""]","We explore some of the consequences of the magnetic carpet for coronal heating. Observations show that most of the magnetic flux in the quiet Sun emerges as ephemeral regions and then quickly migrates to super-granule boundaries. The original ephemeral concentrations fragment, merge, and cancel over a time period of 10-40 hr. Since the network photospheric flux is likely to be concentrated in units of 10(17) Mx or smaller, there will be myriads of coronal separatrix surfaces caused by the highly fragmented photospheric magnetic configuration in the quiet network. We suggest that the formation and dissipation of current sheets along these separatrices are an important contribution to coronal heating. The dissipation of energy along sharp boundaries we call, by analogy with geophysical plate tectonics, the tectonics model of coronal heating. Similar to the case on Earth, the relative motions of the photospheric sources will drive the formation and dissipation of current sheets along a hierarchy of such separatrix surfaces at internal dislocations in the corona. In our preliminary assessment of such dissipation we find that the heating is fairly uniform along the separatrices, so that each elementary coronal flux tube is heated uniformly. However, 95% of the photospheric flux closes low down in the magnetic carpet and the remaining 5% forms large-scale connections, so the magnetic carpet will be heated more effectively than the large-scale corona. This suggests that unresolved observations of coronal loops should exhibit enhanced heating near their feet in the carpet, while the upper parts of large-scale loops should be heated rather uniformly but less strongly.","Small-scale structuring is already involved in the magnetic carpet scenario and  (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2002, see also Section 4.4).","['The description and role of fine structuring of coronal loops is certainly a challenge for coronal physics, also on the side of modeling, essentially because we have few constraints from observations (Section 3.2.2).', 'Small-scale structuring is already involved in the magnetic carpet scenario and  (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2002, see also Section 4.4).', 'One of the first times that the internal structuring of coronal loops have been invoked in a modeling context was for the problem of the interpretation of the uniform filter ratio distribution detected with TRACE along warm loops.', 'Standard models of single hydrostatic loops with uniform heating were soon found to be unable to explain such indication of uniform temperature distribution (Lenz et al., 1999).', 'A uniform filter ratio could be reproduced by the superposition of several thin hydrostatic strands at different temperatures (Reale and Peres, 2000).', 'In alternative, also a model of long loops heated at the footpoints leads to mostly isothermal loops (Aschwanden, 2001).', 'The problem with this model is that footpoint-heated loops (with heating scale height less than 1/3 of the loop half-length) had been shown to be thermally unstable (Mendoza-Briceno and Hood, 1997) and, therefore they cannot be long-lived, as instead observed.', 'A further alternative is to explain observations with steady non-static loops, i.e., with significant flows inside (Winebarger et al., 2001(Winebarger et al., , 2002c.', 'Also this hypothesis does not seem to answer the question (Patsourakos et al., 2004).']",5,"['The description and role of fine structuring of coronal loops is certainly a challenge for coronal physics, also on the side of modeling, essentially because we have few constraints from observations (Section 3.2.2).', 'Small-scale structuring is already involved in the magnetic carpet scenario and  (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2002, see also Section 4.4).', 'One of the first times that the internal structuring of coronal loops have been invoked in a modeling context was for the problem of the interpretation of the uniform filter ratio distribution detected with TRACE along warm loops.', 'Standard models of single hydrostatic loops with uniform heating were soon found to be unable to explain such indication of uniform temperature distribution (Lenz et al., 1999).', 'A uniform filter ratio could be reproduced by the superposition of several thin hydrostatic strands at different temperatures (Reale and Peres, 2000).', 'In alternative, also a model of long loops heated at the footpoints leads to mostly isothermal loops (Aschwanden, 2001).', 'The problem with this model is that footpoint-heated loops (with heating scale height less than 1/3 of the loop half-length) had been shown to be thermally unstable (Mendoza-Briceno and Hood, 1997) and, therefore they cannot be long-lived, as instead observed.', 'A further alternative is to explain observations with steady non-static loops, i.e., with significant flows inside (Winebarger et al., 2001(Winebarger et al., , 2002c.', 'Also this hypothesis does not seem to answer the question (Patsourakos et al., 2004).']"

Ofman""]","The multithreaded structure of active region coronal loops was deduced from past spectroscopic observations. Recent high-resolution observations by Transition Region and Coronal Explorer and Hinode satellites provided direct evidence that active region loops consist of multiple magnetic threads filled with plasma with higher density than neighboring loop material. High-resolution observations of loops near a flare site suggest that the threads are twisted or tangled, the magnetic field is not force free, and flows are present. To better understand these observations, we developed for the first time a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model of twisted multithreaded loops that oscillate as a result of an impulsive event. The twist is induced by applying a rotating velocity field at the footpoint of the initially parallel set of threads, and parallel flow is included. The oscillations of the twisted loops are excited by a fast magnetosonic pulse. The evolution and the damping of the fast magnetosonic wave excited in the twisted multithreaded loop are compared to oscillations of a four-parallel-threaded loop. It was found that twisted loop oscillations result in filamented current and velocity structure that cannot be described by the fundamental kink mode. When parallel flow is present, the oscillation induces nonlinear compressive modulation of the flow and density in the threads. The twisted loop oscillates and damps faster than the parallel-threaded loop. The results of the study demonstrate the effects of the twist, internal loop structure, and flow on the evolution of the waves in coronal active region loops.","Possible deviations from pure 1D evolution might be driven by intense oscillations or kinks, as described in #AUTHOR_TAG (2009).","['Possible deviations from pure 1D evolution might be driven by intense oscillations or kinks, as described in #AUTHOR_TAG (2009).', 'The effect of the three-dimensional loop structure should then be taken into account to describe the interaction with excited MHD waves (McLaughlin and Ofman, 2008;Pascoe et al., 2009;Selwa and Ofman, 2009).', 'However, the real power of 1D loop models, that makes them still on the edge, is that they fully exploit the property of the confined plasma to evolve as a fluid and practically independent of the magnetic field, and that they can include the coronal part, the transition region, and the photospheric footpoint in a single model with thermal conduction.', 'In this framework, we may even simulate a multi-thread structure only by collecting many single loop models together, still with no need to include the description and interaction with the magnetic field (Guarrasi et al., 2010).', 'We should, however, be aware that the magnetic confinement of the loop material is not as strong and the thermal conduction is not as anisotropic below the coronal part of the loop as it is in the corona.']",5,"['Possible deviations from pure 1D evolution might be driven by intense oscillations or kinks, as described in #AUTHOR_TAG (2009).', 'The effect of the three-dimensional loop structure should then be taken into account to describe the interaction with excited MHD waves (McLaughlin and Ofman, 2008;Pascoe et al., 2009;Selwa and Ofman, 2009).', 'However, the real power of 1D loop models, that makes them still on the edge, is that they fully exploit the property of the confined plasma to evolve as a fluid and practically independent of the magnetic field, and that they can include the coronal part, the transition region, and the photospheric footpoint in a single model with thermal conduction.', 'In this framework, we may even simulate a multi-thread structure only by collecting many single loop models together, still with no need to include the description and interaction with the magnetic field (Guarrasi et al., 2010).', 'We should, however, be aware that the magnetic confinement of the loop material is not as strong and the thermal conduction is not as anisotropic below the coronal part of the loop as it is in the corona.']"

Winebarger"", ""Harry P. Warren"", ""David A. Falconer""]","Previous observations have not been able to exclude the possibility that high temperature active region loops are actually composed of many small scale threads that are in various stages of heating and cooling and only appear to be in equilibrium. With new observations from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and X-ray Telescope (XRT) on \textit{Hinode} we have the ability to investigate the properties of high temperature coronal plasma in extraordinary detail. We examine the emission in the core of an active region and find three independent lines of evidence for steady heating. We find that the emission observed in XRT is generally steady for hours, with a fluctuation level of approximately 15% in an individual pixel. Short-lived impulsive heating events are observed, but they appear to be unrelated to the steady emission that dominates the active region. Furthermore, we find no evidence for warm emission that is spatially correlated with the hot emission, as would be expected if the high temperature loops are the result of impulsive heating. Finally, we also find that intensities in the ""moss"", the footpoints of high temperature loops, are consistent with steady heating models provided that we account for the local expansion of the loop from the base of the transition region to the corona. In combination, these results provide strong evidence that the heating in the core of an active region is effectively steady, that is, the time between heating events is short relative to the relevant radiative and conductive cooling times.","This has been taken as part of the evidence toward steady coronal heating in active region cores (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010b, see Section 4.4).","['Variability analyses were conducted also on warm loops present in TRACE data.', 'The brightening of a single coronal loop was analyzed in detail in an observation of more than 2 hours with a cadence of about 30 s (Reale et al., 2000a).', 'The loop brightens from the footpoints to the top, allowing for detailed hydrodynamic modeling (Reale et al., 2000b, see also Section 4.4).', 'Active region transient events, i.e., short-lived brightenings in small-scale loops, detected over a neutral line in a region of emerging flux were interpreted as reconnection events associated with flux emergence (Seaton et al., 2001).', 'Apparent shrinking and expansion of brightening warm loops suggested heating and cooling of different concentric strands, leading to coronal rain visible in the H line (Shimojo et al., 2002, see also Section 3.2.2).', ""Plasma condensations in hot and warm loops were detected also in the analysis of line intensity and velocity in temporal series data from SoHO/CDS (O'Shea et al., 2007)."", 'Antiochos et al.

The most common interpretation is that the temperature along the loop is in fact nearly constant with a value between 1.1 and 1.3 MK. This interpretation has resulted in a class of TRACE loop models with heating close to the footpoints. We analyze the filter ratio method to show that the constant TRACE 195 A/173 A ratios can be reproduced by multithermal differential emission measures (DEMs) along the line of sight over a wide range of peak temperatures, so long as the distribution is relatively flat and spans the temperature response of both channels. Furthermore, in the limit of flat (i.e., very multithermal) DEMs, the filter ratio method is biased toward the ratio of the integrals of the temperature response functions. This result is general to any measurement of intensity ratios that are formed over a nonzero temperature range (e.g., narrow passbands and ion emission lines).","Narrowband filters can show non-unique dependencies of filter ratio values on temperature (e.g., Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2007), due to the presence of several important spectral lines in the bands, but a more general problem can be the bias to detect narrow ranges of temperatures forced by the specific instrument characteristics (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005).","['The limitations of this method are substantial.', 'In particular, one filter ratio value provides one temperature value for each pixel; this is a reliable measurement, within experimental errors, as long as the assumption of isothermal plasma approximately holds for the plasma column in the pixel along the line of sight.', 'If the plasma is considerably multithermal, the temperature value is an average weighted for the instrumental response.', 'Since the response is a highly nonlinear function of the emitting plasma temperature, it is not trivial to interpret the related maps correctly.', 'In addition, it is fundamental to know the instrument response with high precision, in order to avoid systematic errors, which propagate dangerously when filter ratios are evaluated.', 'In this respect, broadband filters provide robust thermal diagnostics, because they are weakly dependent on the details of the atomic physics models, e.g., on the presence of unknown or not well-known spectral lines, on the choice of element abundances.', 'Narrowband filters can show non-unique dependencies of filter ratio values on temperature (e.g., Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2007), due to the presence of several important spectral lines in the bands, but a more general problem can be the bias to detect narrow ranges of temperatures forced by the specific instrument characteristics (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005).', 'This problem can be important especially when the distribution of the emission measure along the line of sight is not simple and highly nonlinear (e.g., Reale et al., 2009a).', 'New methods for thermal diagnostics with narrow band instruments have been proposed (Dudok de Wit et al., 2013).']",5,"['Narrowband filters can show non-unique dependencies of filter ratio values on temperature (e.g., Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2007), due to the presence of several important spectral lines in the bands, but a more general problem can be the bias to detect narrow ranges of temperatures forced by the specific instrument characteristics (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005).', 'This problem can be important especially when the distribution of the emission measure along the line of sight is not simple and highly nonlinear (e.g., Reale et al., 2009a).']"

Foukal""]","We study the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emission of the 22 largest sunspots observed with the ATM SO55 spectrometer. From their time behavior we infer that the pressure and energy balance of the cool corona over these spots is in a steady state. A straightforward analysis of the resolvable temperature structure over several spots shows that conduction across the field lines from the hot corona is of no importance to the energy balance to the cool magnetic loops extending from the umbrae. Also, directly measured radiative losses along the legs of the loops are too large to be entirely balanced by thermal conduction from a heat source located high in the loop. We conclude that a heat input of about 10/sup -4/ ergs cm/sup -3/ s/sup -1/ is required along the full length of the loop, and is largest off the loop axis. The material cannot be supported at the observed heights either hydrostatically or magnetohydrostatically, or by turbulent motions. Taken together, the pressure and energy balance of the cool loops is most simply understood if coronal material is flowing across field lines at the top of the loops and falling downward along both sides under gravity. This analysis suggests that strongmore >> magnetic fields tend to inhibit dissipation of mechanical energy in the corona. We speculate that the corona is heated by transfer of mechanical energy across the very thin transition region immediately over network cell interiors.

Patsourakos"", ""J. A. Klimchuk""]","The highly suppressed thermal transport across the magnetic field in the solar corona makes the determination of the cross-field thermal distribution within coronal loops a powerful diagnostic of the properties of the heating process itself. The cross-field thermal structure is currently being strongly debated. Spectroscopic observations with high temperature fidelity but low spatial resolution indicate that some observed loops are multithermal, whereas imaging observations with high spatial resolution but low temperature fidelity indicate more isothermal conditions. We report here on triple filter observations of coronal loops made by the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE), which has the best spatial resolution currently available. We tested the isothermal hypothesis using the emission measure loci technique and found that the loops are consistent with an isothermal plasma near 1.5 MK only if a generous estimate of the photometric uncertainties is used. A more restrictive estimate based on discussions with the TRACE experimenters rules out the isothermal hypothesis. The observations are much better explained by a multithermal plasma with significant emission measure throughout the range 1-3 MK. The details of the emission measure distribution are not well defined, however. Future subarcsecond spectroscopic observations covering a wide range of temperatures are the most promising means of unlocking the thermal structure of the corona.","Narrowband filters can show non-unique dependencies of filter ratio values on temperature (e.g.,#AUTHOR_TAG and Klimchuk, 2007), due to the presence of several important spectral lines in the bands, but a more general problem can be the bias to detect narrow ranges of temperatures forced by the specific instrument characteristics (Weber et al., 2005).","['The limitations of this method are substantial.', 'In particular, one filter ratio value provides one temperature value for each pixel; this is a reliable measurement, within experimental errors, as long as the assumption of isothermal plasma approximately holds for the plasma column in the pixel along the line of sight.', 'If the plasma is considerably multithermal, the temperature value is an average weighted for the instrumental response.', 'Since the response is a highly nonlinear function of the emitting plasma temperature, it is not trivial to interpret the related maps correctly.', 'In addition, it is fundamental to know the instrument response with high precision, in order to avoid systematic errors, which propagate dangerously when filter ratios are evaluated.', 'In this respect, broadband filters provide robust thermal diagnostics, because they are weakly dependent on the details of the atomic physics models, e.g., on the presence of unknown or not well-known spectral lines, on the choice of element abundances.', 'Narrowband filters can show non-unique dependencies of filter ratio values on temperature (e.g.,#AUTHOR_TAG and Klimchuk, 2007), due to the presence of several important spectral lines in the bands, but a more general problem can be the bias to detect narrow ranges of temperatures forced by the specific instrument characteristics (Weber et al., 2005).', 'This problem can be important especially when the distribution of the emission measure along the line of sight is not simple and highly nonlinear (e.g., Reale et al., 2009a).', 'New methods for thermal diagnostics with narrow band instruments have been proposed (Dudok de Wit et al., 2013).']",5,"['Narrowband filters can show non-unique dependencies of filter ratio values on temperature (e.g.,#AUTHOR_TAG and Klimchuk, 2007), due to the presence of several important spectral lines in the bands, but a more general problem can be the bias to detect narrow ranges of temperatures forced by the specific instrument characteristics (Weber et al., 2005).', 'This problem can be important especially when the distribution of the emission measure along the line of sight is not simple and highly nonlinear (e.g., Reale et al., 2009a).', 'New methods for thermal diagnostics with narrow band instruments have been proposed (Dudok de Wit et al., 2013).']"

We discover that the standard deviation of the fluctuation (the photon noise is removed) is proportional to the mean intensity for both the SXT and TRACE loops. We also analyze the autocorrelation functions in order to obtain the duration of the intensity fluctuations. While the duration of the intensity fluctuations for the SXT loops is relatively short because of the significant photon noise, that for the TRACE loops agrees well with the characteristic cooling timescale.

It is found that the radiative loss curve may change by a factor of 2 during the loop evolution as a result of flows and waves.

In the light of the large diUerences in scope and approach between solar and stellar studies, we have developed a method to translate Yohkoh/SXT data of the whole solar corona into stellar-like data, i.e., to put them in the same format and context as the stellar ones. First from the Yohkoh/SXT images we derive the whole-Sun X-ray emission measure versus tem- perature (EM(T )), in the range 105.5""108 K, during the speci--c observation. Then, we synthesize the solar X-ray spectrum; --nally, we fold the spectrum through the instrumental response of nonsolar X-ray observatories, for instance, ROSAT /PSPC and ASCA/SIS.

This result means that the vast majority of the active region emission in chromospheric and transition region lines is generated by plasma not directly connected with the coronal plasma that constitutes the observed coronal loops. We determine the observed intensities of coronal lines relative to the observed transition region and chromospheric emission and compare them with predictions from loop models having uniform cross section and different heating functions.

Warren"", ""Amy R. Winebarger"", ""John T.

Recent observations in the EUV, however, have discovered a class of active region loops that are difficult to reconcile with static loop models. In this paper, we take a comprehensive look at how coronal loops compare with static models. We select 67 loops with a large range of apex temperatures and half-lengths observed with either the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer or the Soft X-Ray Telescope. We compare these observations to static loop models using both uniform and nonuniform heating. We find that only 2 of the 67 loops are fully consistent with static solutions with uniform heating and a filling factor of unity. We further find that long, cool ( 3 MK) loops are as much as 63 times underdense when compared to the static solutions with uniform heating. We then consider the possibility that the disparity in the density could be due to steady, nonuniform heating along the loop and find that footpoint heating can increase densities only by a factor of 3 over density solutions with uniform heating while loop-top heating results in density solutions that are, at most, a factor of 2.5 smaller than the density solutions with uniform heating. Only 19 of the 67 loops in this data set could be fully consistent with hydrodynamic solutions with steady heating. Hence, we conclude that static loop models are poor representations of most active region loops.","Another puzzling issue, certainly linked to the loop isothermal appearance, is that warm loops are often diagnosed to be overdense with respect to the equilibrium values predicted by loop scaling laws (Lenz et al., 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2003a, Section 4.1.1).","['Another puzzling issue, certainly linked to the loop isothermal appearance, is that warm loops are often diagnosed to be overdense with respect to the equilibrium values predicted by loop scaling laws (Lenz et al., 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2003a, Section 4.1.1).', 'To explain both these pieces of evidence, several authors claimed that the loops cannot be at equilibrium and that they must be filamented and cooling from a hotter state, probably continuously subject to heating episodes (nanoflares, Warren et al., 2002, 2003, Sections 4.2 and4.4).', 'Other authors proposed that part of the effect might be due to inaccurate background subtraction (Del Zanna and Mason, 2003).']",5,"['Another puzzling issue, certainly linked to the loop isothermal appearance, is that warm loops are often diagnosed to be overdense with respect to the equilibrium values predicted by loop scaling laws (Lenz et al., 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2003a, Section 4.1.1).']"

Two classes of loops are examined, namely symmetric loops with a temperature maximum at the top but now having a length greater than the pressure scale height and loops which have a local temperature minimum at the top. For the first class, new scaling laws are found which relate the base pressure and loop length to the base heating, the heating deposition scale height, and the pressure scale height. It is found that loops for which the length is greater than about two to three times the pressure scale height do not have stable solutions unless they have a temperature minimum at the top. Computed models with a temperature inversion at the top are permitted in a wider range of heating deposition scale height values than are loops with a temperature maximum at the top.

Heyvaerts"", ""T. D. Arber"", ""D. Mackay"", ""J. L. Culhane"", ""L. W. Acton""]","One of the paradigms about coronal heating has been the belief that the mean or summit temperature of a coronal loop is completely insensitive to the nature of the heating mechanisms. However, we point out that the temperature profile along a coronal loop is highly sensitive to the form of the heating. For example, when a steady state heating is balanced by thermal conduction, a uniform heating function makes the heat flux a linear function of distance along the loop, while T7/2 increases quadratically from the coronal footpoints; when the heating is concentrated near the coronal base, the heat flux is small and the T7/2 profile is flat above the base; when the heat is focused near the summit of a loop, the heat flux is constant and T7/2 is a linear function of distance below the summit. It is therefore important to determine how the heat deposition from particular heating mechanisms varies spatially within coronal structures such as loops or arcades and to compare it to high-quality measurements of the temperature profiles. We propose a new two-part approach to try and solve the coronal heating problem, namely, first of all to use observed temperature profiles to deduce the form of the heating, and second to use that heating form to deduce the likely heating mechanism. In particular, we apply this philosophy to a preliminary analysis of Yohkoh observations of the large-scale solar corona. This gives strong evidence against heating concentrated near the loop base for such loops and suggests that heating uniformly distributed along the loop is slightly more likely than heating concentrated at the summit. The implication is that large-scale loops are heated in situ throughout their length, rather than being a steady response to low-lying heating near their feet or at their summits. Unless waves can be shown to produce a heating close enough to uniform, the evidence is therefore at present for these large loops more in favor of turbulent reconnection at many small randomly distributed current sheets, which is likely to be able to do so. In addition, we suggest that the decline in coronal intensity by a factor of 100 from solar maximum to solar minimum is a natural consequence of the observed ratio of magnetic field strength in active regions and the quiet Sun; the altitude of the maximum temperature in coronal holes may represent the dissipation height of AlfvŽn waves by turbulent phase mixing; and the difference in maximum temperature in closed and open regimes may be understood in terms of the roles of the conductive flux there.","different results depending mostly on the different ways to treat the background (#AUTHOR_TAG  et al., 2000;Aschwanden et al., 2001;Reale, 2002a).","['The problem of diagnostics of loop plasma from filter ratios, and, more in general, the whole analysis of loop observations, are made even more difficult by the invariable presence of other structures intersecting along the line of sight.', 'A uniform diffuse background emission also affects the temperature diagnostics, by adding systematic offsets that alter the filter ratio values.', 'The task of subtracting this ""background emission"" from the measured emission is non-trivial and can seriously bias the results of the whole analysis.', 'This problem emerged dramatically when the analysis of the same large loop structure observed with Yohkoh/SXT on the solar limb led to three Living Reviews in Solar Physics http://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4', 'different results depending mostly on the different ways to treat the background (#AUTHOR_TAG  et al., 2000;Aschwanden et al., 2001;Reale, 2002a).', 'The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics, such as the passband and the point response function: it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue (e.g., Del Zanna and Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;Terzo and Reale, 2010).', 'The problem can be mitigated if one analyzes loops as far as possible isolated from other loops, but this is not easy, for instance, in active regions.', 'If this is not the case, broadband filters may also include contamination from many structures at relatively different temperature and make the analysis of single loops harder.', 'The problem of background subtraction in loop analysis has been addressed by several authors, who apply different subtraction ranging from simple offset, to emission in nearby pixels or subregions, to values interpolated between the loop sides, to whole images at times when the loop is no longer (or not yet) visible (Testa et al., 2002;Del Zanna and Mason, 2003;Schmelz et al., 2003;Aschwanden and Nightingale, 2005;Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;Terzo and Reale, 2010).']",5,"['The problem of diagnostics of loop plasma from filter ratios, and, more in general, the whole analysis of loop observations, are made even more difficult by the invariable presence of other structures intersecting along the line of sight.', 'A uniform diffuse background emission also affects the temperature diagnostics, by adding systematic offsets that alter the filter ratio values.', 'The task of subtracting this ""background emission"" from the measured emission is non-trivial and can seriously bias the results of the whole analysis.', 'This problem emerged dramatically when the analysis of the same large loop structure observed with Yohkoh/SXT on the solar limb led to three Living Reviews in Solar Physics http://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4', 'different results depending mostly on the different ways to treat the background (#AUTHOR_TAG  et al., 2000;Aschwanden et al., 2001;Reale, 2002a).']"

Bareford"", ""A. W. Hood"", ""P. K. Browning""]","Context. It is thought likely that vast numbers of nanoflares are responsible for the corona having a temperature of millions of degrees. Current observational technologies lack the resolving power to confirm the nanoflare hypothesis. An alternative approach is to construct a magnetohydrodynamic coronal loop model that has the ability to predict nanoflare energy distributions. Aims. This paper presents the initial results generated by a coronal loop model that flares whenever it becomes unstable to an ideal MHD kink mode. A feature of the model is that it predicts heating events with a range of sizes, depending on where the instability threshold for linear kink modes is encountered. The aims are to calculate the distribution of event energies and to investigate whether kink instability can be predicted from a single parameter. Methods. The loop is represented as a straight line-tied cylinder. The twisting caused by random photospheric motions is captured by two parameters, representing the ratio of current density to field strength for specific regions of the loop. Instability onset is mapped as a closed boundary in the 2D parameter space. Dissipation of the loop's magnetic energy begins during the nonlinear stage of the instability, which develops as a consequence of current sheet reconnection. After flaring, the loop evolves to the state of lowest energy where, in accordance with relaxation theory, the ratio of current to field is constant throughout the loop and helicity is conserved. Results. There exists substantial variation in the radial magnetic twist profiles for the loop states along the instability threshold. These results suggest that instability cannot be predicted by any simple twist-derived property reaching a critical value. The model is applied such that the loop undergoes repeated episodes of instability followed by energy-releasing relaxation. Hence, an energy distribution of the nanoflares produced is collated. This paper also presents the calculated relaxation states and energy releases for all instability threshold points. Conclusions. The final energy distribution features two nanoflare populations that follow different power laws. The power law index for the higher energy population is more than sufficient for coronal heating.","Loop twisting or braiding and kink instability can lead to magnetic reconnection with the formation and fragmentation of thin current sheets and their dissipation through resistivity (Hood et al., 2009b;Wilmot-Smith et al., 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010;Pontin et al., 2011;Wilmot-Smith et al., 2011;Bareford et al., 2011Bareford et al., , 2013.","['It is known that twisted loops can become kink unstable above a critical twist; however, according to Parker (1988), as soon as the magnetic field lines are tangled at an angle of ___ 15 __� , enough magnetic energy can be released to power a loop by rapid reconnection across the spontaneous tangential discontinuities.', 'The dissipation destroys the cross-component of the magnetic field as rapidly as it is produced by the motion of the footpoints, reaching a steady state.', 'The twisting of coronal loops has been studied in the framework of kink instability (Hood and Priest, 1979b;Velli et al., 1990) with resistive effects (Baty, 2000), of loop cross-section (Klimchuk, 2000), of flux emer-Living Reviews in Solar Physics http://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4', 'gence (Hood et al., 2009a), of cellular automaton loop modeling (L�_pez Fuentes and Klimchuk, 2010), and in connection with transverse oscillations (Ofman, 2009).', 'Loop twisting or braiding and kink instability can lead to magnetic reconnection with the formation and fragmentation of thin current sheets and their dissipation through resistivity (Hood et al., 2009b;Wilmot-Smith et al., 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010;Pontin et al., 2011;Wilmot-Smith et al., 2011;Bareford et al., 2011Bareford et al., , 2013.']",5,"['Loop twisting or braiding and kink instability can lead to magnetic reconnection with the formation and fragmentation of thin current sheets and their dissipation through resistivity (Hood et al., 2009b;Wilmot-Smith et al., 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010;Pontin et al., 2011;Wilmot-Smith et al., 2011;Bareford et al., 2011Bareford et al., , 2013.']"

Nagai""]","A numerical investigation is carried out of the gas dynamical response of the solar atmosphere to a flare energy input in the form of precipitating nonthermal electrons. Rather than discussing the origin of these electrons, the spectral and temporal characteristics of the injected flux are inferred through a thick-target model of hard X-ray bremsstrahlung production. It is assumed that the electrons spiral about preexisting magnetic field lines, making it possible for a one-dimensional spatial treatment to be performed. It is also assumed that all electron energy losses are due to Coulomb collisions with ambient particles; that is, return-current ohmic effects and collective plasma processes are neglected. The results are contrasted with earlier work on conductive heating of the flare atmosphere. A local temperature peak is seen at a height of approximately 1500 km above the photosphere. This derives from a spatial maximum in the energy deposition rate from an electron beam. It is noted that such a feature is not present in conductively heated models. The associated localized region of high pressure drives material both upward and downward.","These equations can be solved numerically and several specific codes have been used extensively to investigate the physics of coronal loops and of X-ray flares (e.g., Nagai, 1980;Peres et al., 1982;Doschek et al., 1982;#AUTHOR_TAG and Emslie, 1984;Fisher et al., 1985a,a,a;MacNeice, 1986;Gan et al., 1991;Hansteen, 1993;Betta et al., 1997;Antiochos et al., 1999;Ofman and Wang, 2002;M�_ller et al., 2003;Bradshaw and Mason, 2003;Sigalotti and Mendoza-Briceͱo, 2003;Bradshaw and Cargill, 2006).","['These equations can be solved numerically and several specific codes have been used extensively to investigate the physics of coronal loops and of X-ray flares (e.g., Nagai, 1980;Peres et al., 1982;Doschek et al., 1982;#AUTHOR_TAG and Emslie, 1984;Fisher et al., 1985a,a,a;MacNeice, 1986;Gan et al., 1991;Hansteen, 1993;Betta et al., 1997;Antiochos et al., 1999;Ofman and Wang, 2002;M�_ller et al., 2003;Bradshaw and Mason, 2003;Sigalotti and Mendoza-Briceͱo, 2003;Bradshaw and Cargill, 2006).']",5,"['These equations can be solved numerically and several specific codes have been used extensively to investigate the physics of coronal loops and of X-ray flares (e.g., Nagai, 1980;Peres et al., 1982;Doschek et al., 1982;#AUTHOR_TAG and Emslie, 1984;Fisher et al., 1985a,a,a;MacNeice, 1986;Gan et al., 1991;Hansteen, 1993;Betta et al., 1997;Antiochos et al., 1999;Ofman and Wang, 2002;M�_ller et al., 2003;Bradshaw and Mason, 2003;Sigalotti and Mendoza-Briceͱo, 2003;Bradshaw and Cargill, 2006).']"

Yun"", ""A. I. Poland""]","The existence of prevailing redshifts in the UV lines formed in the solar transition region raises an important question concerning its physical origin and its role in the mass and energy balance of the outer solar atmosphere. A series of UV spectral lines observed by SUMER has been analyzed to obtain the spatial average of Doppler shifts in the quiet Sun as a function of temperature. The UV lines used for the analysis cover temperatures ranging from 104 to 106 K. The wavelength calibration has been done in reference to the coolest chromospheric lines such as neutral lines of silicon and sulfur. The positioning of the line center in blended lines has been made by employing a constrained multi-Gaussian fitting technique. The error in the measured average of the Doppler shifts is estimated to be smaller than 1 km s-1. Our results show that the average Doppler shift at the base of the transition region is about 1-2 km s-1, increasing with temperature with a peak value of 11 km s-1 near T = 2.3 _ 105 K. Then it decreases but remains still above zero (5 km s-1 in Ne VIII lines and 4 km s-1 in Mg X lines). We find that this behavior can be explained by the dominance of emission from plasma flowing downward from the upper hot region to the lower cool region along flux tubes with varying cross section. Assuming that pressure and mass flux are constant along a flux tube, the cross section of a typical flux tube has been estimated as a function of temperature. It turns out that the cross section is nearly constant below T = 105 K and then expands by a factor of about 30 at T = 106 K.

Rabin""]","The electron plasma frequency $\omega_{pe}$ and electron gyrofrequency $\Omega_e$ are two parameters that allow us to describe the properties of a plasma and to constrain the physical phenomena at play, for instance, whether a maser instability develops. In this paper, we aim to show that the maser instability can exist in the solar corona. We perform an in-depth analysis of the $\omega_{pe}$/$\Omega_e$ ratio for simple theoretical and complex solar magnetic field configurations. Using the combination of force-free models for the magnetic field and hydrostatic models for the plasma properties, we determine the ratio of the plasma frequency to the gyrofrequency for electrons. For the sake of comparison, we compute the ratio for bipolar magnetic fields containing a twisted flux bundle, and for four different observed active regions. We also study how $\omega_{pe}$/$\Omega_e$ is affected by the potential and non-linear force-free field models. We demonstrate that the ratio of the plasma frequency to the gyrofrequency for electrons can be estimated by this novel method combining magnetic field extrapolation techniques and hydrodynamic models. Even if statistically not significant, values of $\omega_{pe}$/$\Omega_e$ $\leq$ 1 are present in all examples, and are located in the low corona near to photosphere below one pressure scale-height and/or in the vicinity of twisted flux bundles. The values of $\omega_{pe}$/$\Omega_e$ are lower for non-linear force-free fields than potential fields, thus increasing the possibility of maser instability in the corona. From this new approach for estimating $\omega_{pe}$/$\Omega_e$, we conclude that the electron maser instability can exist in the solar corona above active regions. The importance of the maser instability in coronal active regions depends on the complexity and topology of the magnetic field configurations.Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, 1 appendix (with 1 figure","different results depending mostly on the different ways to treat the background (Priest et al., 2000;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001;Reale, 2002a).","['The problem of diagnostics of loop plasma from filter ratios, and, more in general, the whole analysis of loop observations, are made even more difficult by the invariable presence of other structures intersecting along the line of sight.', 'A uniform diffuse background emission also affects the temperature diagnostics, by adding systematic offsets that alter the filter ratio values.', 'The task of subtracting this ""background emission"" from the measured emission is non-trivial and can seriously bias the results of the whole analysis.', 'This problem emerged dramatically when the analysis of the same large loop structure observed with Yohkoh/SXT on the solar limb led to three Living Reviews in Solar Physics http://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4', 'different results depending mostly on the different ways to treat the background (Priest et al., 2000;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001;Reale, 2002a).', 'The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics, such as the passband and the point response function: it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue (e.g., Del Zanna and Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;Terzo and Reale, 2010).', 'The problem can be mitigated if one analyzes loops as far as possible isolated from other loops, but this is not easy, for instance, in active regions.', 'If this is not the case, broadband filters may also include contamination from many structures at relatively different temperature and make the analysis of single loops harder.', 'The problem of background subtraction in loop analysis has been addressed by several authors, who apply different subtraction ranging from simple offset, to emission in nearby pixels or subregions, to values interpolated between the loop sides, to whole images at times when the loop is no longer (or not yet) visible (Testa et al., 2002;Del Zanna and Mason, 2003;Schmelz et al., 2003;Aschwanden and Nightingale, 2005;Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;Terzo and Reale, 2010).']",5,"['different results depending mostly on the different ways to treat the background (Priest et al., 2000;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001;Reale, 2002a).']"

Li""]","We present the results of a thorough parameter study of coronal loop models in the aim to explore the mechanism behind coronal heating. The two-fluid coronal loops described in this paper have lengths from 10 Mm to 600 Mm and consist of protons and electrons. The loops are treated with our unique, self-consistent, steady state dynamic loop model to derive the basic parameters (as introduced by Li & Habbal 2003, ApJ, 598, L125). The only heating mechanism assumed is turbulently generated AlfvŽn waves that carry the necessary flux from the chromosphere to energize the coronal plasma through preferential heating of the proton gas. Strong Coulomb coupling allows energy to pass efficiently from protons to electrons. We have control over the independent variables, driving scale (l) and AlfvŽn amplitude (_), which influence the dissipation and flux of these resonant waves. We find ""mapping"" the loop parameter response to varying l with fixed _ a useful tool to find where certain conditions for each loop length exist. From this, we are able to pin-point where the coldest solution lies. For a loop of L=10 Mm, the coolest loops have a maximum temperature of T=0.75 MK. We also focus on a L=40 Mm loop and vary both l and _ so we can compare results with existing work. From this parameter mapping we can categorise the loop heating profiles. Our model indicates the existence of footpoint, non-uniformly and quasi-uniformly heated profiles. There is also strong evidence to suggest the same mechanism may apply to hot, SXT loops.","Hydrodynamic loop modeling showed that Alfvͩn waves deposit significant momentum in the plasma, and that steady state conditions with significant flows and relatively high density can be reached (#AUTHOR_TAG and Li, 2005).","['Plasma waves have been more recently proposed to have an important role in driving flows within loops.', 'Acoustic waves excited by heat pulses at the chromospheric loop footpoints and damped by thermal conduction in corona are possible candidates (Taroyan et al., 2005).', 'Even more attention received the propagation of Alfvͩn waves in coronal loops.', 'Hydrodynamic loop modeling showed that Alfvͩn waves deposit significant momentum in the plasma, and that steady state conditions with significant flows and relatively high density can be reached (#AUTHOR_TAG and Li, 2005).', 'Analogous results were obtained independently with a different approach: considering a wind-like model to describe a long isothermal loop, Grappin et al.

Mason"", ""Bhola N. Dwivedi"", ""Giulio Del Zanna"", ""Peter R. Young""]","We have carried out a study of active region loops using observations from the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode using 1'' raster data for an active region observed on 2007 May 19. We find that active region structures which are clearly discernible in cooler lines (Å1 MK) become ""fuzzy"" at higher temperatures (Å2 MK). The active region was comprised of redshifted emissions (downflows) in the core and blueshifted emissions (upflows) at the boundary. The flow velocities estimated in the two regions located near the footpoints of coronal loop showed redshifted emission at transition region temperature and blueshifted emission at coronal temperature. The upflow speed in these regions increased with temperature. For more detailed study we selected one particular well-defined loop. Downward flows are detected along the coronal loop, being stronger in lower-temperature lines (rising up to 60 km s-1 near the footpoint). The downflow was localized toward the footpoint in transition region lines (Si VII) and toward the loop top in high-temperature line (Fe XV). By carefully accounting for the background emission we found that the loop structure was close to isothermal for each position along the loop, with the temperature rising from around 0.8 MK to 1.5 MK from the close to the base to higher up toward the apex (Å75 Mm). We derived electron density using well-established line ratio diagnostic techniques. Electron densities along the active region loop were found to vary from 1010 cm-3 close to the footpoint to 108.5 cm-3 higher up. A lower electron density, varying from 109 cm-3 close to the footpoint to 108.5 cm-3 higher up, was found for the lower temperature density diagnostic. Using these densities we derived filling factors in along the coronal loop which can be as low as 0.02 near the base of the loop. The filling factor increased with projected height of the loop. These results provide important constraints on coronal loop modeling.","These warm loops would coexist with hot loops and would show a multithermal emission measure distribution (Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2007;Warren et al., 2008a;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009); ii) we might have warm loops as an obvious result of a relatively low average heating input in the loop.","['In summary, the current observational framework and loop analysis seems to indicate that for a coherent scenario warm loops are manifestations of at least three different loop conditions: i) in loops consisting of bundles of thin independently-heated strands, few cooling strands of steady hot X-ray loops might be detected as warm overdense loops in the UV band.', 'These warm loops would coexist with hot loops and would show a multithermal emission measure distribution (Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2007;Warren et al., 2008a;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009); ii) we might have warm loops as an obvious result of a relatively low average heating input in the loop.', 'These loops would be much less visible in the X-rays and, thus, would not be co-spatial with hot loops, and would also be much less multithermal (Di Giorgio et al., 2003;Landi and Feldman, 2004;Aschwanden and Nightingale, 2005;Noglik et al., 2008); iii) warm loops might be globally cooling from a status of hot X-ray loop (Reale and Ciaravella, 2006).', 'These loops would also be overdense and co-spatial with hot loops but with a time shift of the X-ray and UV light curves, i.e., they would be bright in the X-rays before they are in the UV band.', 'Also these loops would have a relatively narrow thermal distribution along the line of sight.', 'There is some indication that there might be fundamental differences in the heating regime and cadence between hot and warm loops (Warren et al., 2010a).']",5,"['In summary, the current observational framework and loop analysis seems to indicate that for a coherent scenario warm loops are manifestations of at least three different loop conditions: i) in loops consisting of bundles of thin independently-heated strands, few cooling strands of steady hot X-ray loops might be detected as warm overdense loops in the UV band.', 'These warm loops would coexist with hot loops and would show a multithermal emission measure distribution (Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2007;Warren et al., 2008a;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009); ii) we might have warm loops as an obvious result of a relatively low average heating input in the loop.', 'These loops would be much less visible in the X-rays and, thus, would not be co-spatial with hot loops, and would also be much less multithermal (Di Giorgio et al., 2003;Landi and Feldman, 2004;Aschwanden and Nightingale, 2005;Noglik et al., 2008); iii) warm loops might be globally cooling from a status of hot X-ray loop (Reale and Ciaravella, 2006).', 'These loops would also be overdense and co-spatial with hot loops but with a time shift of the X-ray and UV light curves, i.e., they would be bright in the X-rays before they are in the UV band.', 'Also these loops would have a relatively narrow thermal distribution along the line of sight.']"

Terzo"", ""F. Reale""]","In the framework of TRACE coronal observations, we compare the analysis and diagnostics of a loop after subtracting the background with two different and independent methods. The dataset includes sequences of images in the 171 A, 195 A filter bands of TRACE. One background subtraction method consists in taking as background values those obtained from interpolation between concentric strips around the analyzed loop. The other method is a pixel-to-pixel subtraction of the final image when the loop had completely faded out, already used by Reale & Ciaravella 2006. We compare the emission distributions along the loop obtained with the two methods and find that they are considerably different. We find differences as well in the related derive filter ratio and temperature profiles. In particular, the pixel-to-pixel subtraction leads to coherent diagnostics of a cooling loop. With the other subtraction the diagnostics are much less clear. The background subtraction is a delicate issue in the analysis of a loop. The pixel-to-pixel subtraction appears to be more reliable, but its application is not always possible. Subtraction from interpolation between surrounding regions can produce higher systematic errors, because of intersecting structures and of the large amount of subtracted emission in TRACE observations.Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure","The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics, such as the passband and the point response function: it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue (e.g., Del Zanna and Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG and Reale, 2010).","['The problem of diagnostics of loop plasma from filter ratios, and, more in general, the whole analysis of loop observations, are made even more difficult by the invariable presence of other structures intersecting along the line of sight.', 'A uniform diffuse background emission also affects the temperature diagnostics, by adding systematic offsets that alter the filter ratio values.', 'The task of subtracting this ""background emission"" from the measured emission is non-trivial and can seriously bias the results of the whole analysis.', 'This problem emerged dramatically when the analysis of the same large loop structure observed with Yohkoh/SXT on the solar limb led to three Living Reviews in Solar Physics http://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4', 'different results depending mostly on the different ways to treat the background (Priest et al., 2000;Aschwanden et al., 2001;Reale, 2002a).', 'The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics, such as the passband and the point response function: it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue (e.g., Del Zanna and Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG and Reale, 2010).', 'The problem can be mitigated if one analyzes loops as far as possible isolated from other loops, but this is not easy, for instance, in active regions.', 'If this is not the case, broadband filters may also include contamination from many structures at relatively different temperature and make the analysis of single loops harder.', 'The problem of background subtraction in loop analysis has been addressed by several authors, who apply different subtraction ranging from simple offset, to emission in nearby pixels or subregions, to values interpolated between the loop sides, to whole images at times when the loop is no longer (or not yet) visible (Testa et al., 2002;Del Zanna and Mason, 2003;Schmelz et al., 2003;Aschwanden and Nightingale, 2005;Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;Terzo and Reale, 2010).']",5,"['The problem of diagnostics of loop plasma from filter ratios, and, more in general, the whole analysis of loop observations, are made even more difficult by the invariable presence of other structures intersecting along the line of sight.', 'The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics, such as the passband and the point response function: it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue (e.g., Del Zanna and Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG and Reale, 2010).']"

As discussed in Paper II, the EM(T) is our starting point for studying the Sun as an X-ray star. To this purpose, we need to extract as much information as possible from the Yohkoh/SXT data covering the whole range of the Yohkoh/SXT temperature sensitivity, i.e., 5.5<logT(K)<8. In particular at low photon counts and temperatures below 106 K, errors on the temperature and emission measure determination are expected to be large. To this end, we have made an extensive set of simulations to explore the nominal performance of the entire system (instrument and data analysis system) in the determination of the plasma temperature and emission measure at low, intermediate, and high photon counts per pixel. We have shown that low-count data with a number of photons per pixel nphot<10 are affected by large errors and lead to the derivation of an unrealistic EM(T) characterized by a steep negative slope. As a result, we have devised an analysis method that minimizes the instrumental and statistical effects on the determination of EM(T) and allows us to determine the global coronal EM(T). As a first application to real SXT data, we have derived the EM(T) of the Sun close to the maximum of the solar cycle, a challenging case. The low-temperature part is in agreement with analogous studies made in the UV band, and it shows a well-defined maximum at T~2 MK.","In particular, whereas the loop total emission measure distribution should steepen above the canonical 1.5 (Jordan, 1980;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2000;Peres et al., 2001) dependence for temperature above 1 MK.","['Models of loops made of thousands of nanoflare-heated strands were developed and applied to derive detailed predictions (Cargill, 1994).', 'In particular, whereas the loop total emission measure distribution should steepen above the canonical 1.5 (Jordan, 1980;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2000;Peres et al., 2001) dependence for temperature above 1 MK.', 'Moreover, it was stressed the importance of the dependence of effects such as the plasma dynamics (filling and draining) on the loop filling factor driven by the elemental heat pulse size (Section 4.1.2).', 'The nanoflare model was early applied to the heating of coronal loops observed by Yohkoh (Cargill and Klimchuk, 1997).', 'A good match was found only for hot (4 MK) loops, with filling factors less than 0.1, so that it was hypothesized the existence of two distinct classes of hot loops.']",5,"['In particular, whereas the loop total emission measure distribution should steepen above the canonical 1.5 (Jordan, 1980;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2000;Peres et al., 2001) dependence for temperature above 1 MK.']"

This model implies that some of the loops must reach temperatures where X-ray filters are sensitive (> 2.5 MK) before they cool to EUV temperatures. Hence, some bright EUV loops must be preceded by bright X-ray loops. Previous analysis of X-ray and EUV active region observations, however, have concluded that EUV loops are not preceded by X-ray loops. In this paper, we examine two active regions observed in both X-ray and EUV filters and analyze the evolution of five loops over several hours. These loops first appear bright in the X-ray images and later appear bright in the EUV images. The delay between the appearance of the loops in the X-ray and EUV filters is as little as 1 hour and as much as 3 hours. All five loops appear as single ``monolithic'' structures in the X-ray images, but are resolved into many smaller structures in the (higher resolution) EUV images. The positions of the loops appear to shift during cooling implying that the magnetic field is changing as the loops evolve. There is no correlation between the brightness of the loop in the X-ray and EUV filters meaning a bright X-ray loop does not necessarily cool to a bright EUV loop and vice versa.

These loops are oriented along the CDS slit, so all pixels in each loop were observed simultaneously. So, although the instrument has a relatively slow time cadence, changes as a function of time that may occur during the CDS raster buildup will not affect the loop temperature results. Differential emission measure (DEM) analysis using a forward-folding technique shows different results for the two loops. For the first loop, the intensities of the lines that remain after background subtraction are well fit with a DEM curve that collapses to a single spike. In other words, the loop plasma at this location is isothermal. This analysis is confirmed with an emission measure loci method and agrees with the results obtained recently by other authors that show that the moderate spatial resolution of CDS can detect isothermal structures. For the second loop, the background-subtracted line intensities require a broad DEM, not consistent with isothermal plasma. This conclusion is confirmed with an automatic-inversion DEM method. In this Letter, we specifically address some of the concerns raised about CDS temperature analysis: the slow CDS temporal resolution, the moderate CDS spatial resolution, the inherent smoothing associated with DEM inversion, and line-of-sight effects on the DEM distribution.","From a differential emission measure (DEM) analysis with a forward-folding technique on SoHO/CDS data, some loops were found to be isothermal and others to have a broad DEM (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007(Schmelz et al., , 2008.","['SoHO spectrometric data have contributed to investigate the loop thermal structure for a long time.', 'From a differential emission measure (DEM) analysis with a forward-folding technique on SoHO/CDS data, some loops were found to be isothermal and others to have a broad DEM (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007(Schmelz et al., , 2008.', 'Three distinct isothermal components, reminiscent of coronal hole, quiet-Sun, and active region plasmas, were found from the analysis of an active region spectrum observed by the SoHO/SUMER (Landi and Feldman, 2008).']",5,"['From a differential emission measure (DEM) analysis with a forward-folding technique on SoHO/CDS data, some loops were found to be isothermal and others to have a broad DEM (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007(Schmelz et al., , 2008.', 'Three distinct isothermal components, reminiscent of coronal hole, quiet-Sun, and active region plasmas, were found from the analysis of an active region spectrum observed by the SoHO/SUMER (Landi and Feldman, 2008).']"

Warren"", ""David H. Brooks"", ""Amy R. Winebarger""]","We present observations of high-temperature emission in the core of a solar active region using instruments on Hinode and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). These multi-instrument observations allow us to determine the distribution of plasma temperatures and follow the evolution of emission at different temperatures. We find that at the apex of the high-temperature loops the emission measure distribution is strongly peaked near 4 MK and falls off sharply at both higher and lower temperatures. Perhaps most significantly, the emission measure at 0.5 MK is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude from the peak at 4 MK. We also find that the temporal evolution in broadband soft X-ray images is relatively constant over about 6 hr of observing. Observations in the cooler SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) bandpasses generally do not show cooling loops in the core of the active region, consistent with the steady emission observed at high temperatures. These observations suggest that the high-temperature loops observed in the core of an active region are close to equilibrium. We find that it is possible to reproduce the relative intensities of high-temperature emission lines with a simple, high-frequency heating scenario where heating events occur on timescales much less than a characteristic cooling time. In contrast, low-frequency heating scenarios, which are commonly invoked to describe nanoflare models of coronal heating, do not reproduce the relative intensities of high-temperature emission lines and predict low-temperature emission that is approximately an order of magnitude too large. We also present an initial look at images from the SDO/AIA 94  channel, which is sensitive to Fe XVIII.","Also, the peak of the coronal emission measure of active regions -where the loops are brightest -is above 2 MK, which is best observed in X-rays (e.g., Peres et al., 2000;Reale et al., 2009a;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).","['Although coronal loops are often well defined and studied in the EUV band, detected by many space mission spectrometers like those on board SoHO and Hinode, and by high resolution imagers such as TRACE and SDO/AIA, the bulk of coronal loops is visible in the X-ray band (Figure 1).', 'Also, the peak of the coronal emission measure of active regions -where the loops are brightest -is above 2 MK, which is best observed in X-rays (e.g., Peres et al., 2000;Reale et al., 2009a;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).']",5,"['Also, the peak of the coronal emission measure of active regions -where the loops are brightest -is above 2 MK, which is best observed in X-rays (e.g., Peres et al., 2000;Reale et al., 2009a;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).']"

It has been suggested that mass flows may explain these discrepancies. We investigate this conjecture using one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of steady flows in coronal loops. The flows are driven by asymmetric heating that decreases exponentially along the loop from one footpoint to the other. We find that a sufficiently large heating asymmetry can produce density enhancements consistent with a sizable fraction of the observed loops, but that the pressure scale heights are smaller than the corresponding gravitational scale heights, and that the filter ratio profiles are highly structured, in stark contrast to the observations. We conclude that most warm EUV loops cannot be explained by steady flows.

This cycle takes only a few minutes, so each of these nonflaring structures did not change significantly during the cycle. We chose five pixels along each loop and five carefully selected background pixels. Temperature analysis was done four different ways: (1) standard EIT analysis on the five loop pixels with no background subtraction; (2) constant background subtraction for each EIT image; (3) pixel pair background subtraction; and (4) radial background array subtraction (this method works only for loops observed above the limb). Each method produced two estimates of temperature for each loop pixel, one from the 171:195 ratio and the second for the 195:284 ratio. Both ratios produced loops with a uniform temperature, but each ratio results in a statistically different temperature value, perhaps indicating that the plasma along the line of sight was not isothermal. Background subtraction did not affect the EIT temperature analysis, i.e., the results were the same with and without background subtraction. The results for loops on the limb were ``cleaner'' i.e., had less scatter, than for loops on the disk.

The median temperature is 5.7 x 106 K, and the median pressure is 1.6 x 1016 cm-3 K. We have carefully examined the possible random and systematic errors in the measurements and have found, through simulated observations, that the errors produced by photon statistical noise can sometimes greatly exceed the values given by commonly used error expressions, derived here and elsewhere. Furthermore, the measurements are not normally distributed and therefore are not amenable to standard statistical analysis. We have used nonparametric methods to look for statistical relationships and find that temperature and length are uncorrelated and that pressure varies inversely with length to approximately the first power. The observed lifetimes of the loops are much longer than their computed cooling times, suggesting that the loops are in a state of quasi-static equilibrium. This has allowed us to use simple scaling law theory to infer that the volumetric heating rate in the loops (averaged along the loop axis) varies inversely with length to approximately the second power.

Extrapolation of the energy frequency distribution of observed microflares, which follows a power law to lower energies, can give an estimation of the importance of nanoflares for heating the solar corona. If the power-law index is greater than 2, then the nanoflare contribution is dominant. We model a time series of extreme-ultraviolet emission radiance as random flares with a power-law exponent of the flare event distribution. The model is based on three key parameters: the flare rate, the flare duration, and the power-law exponent of the flare intensity frequency distribution. We use this model to simulate emission line radiance detected in 171 , observed by Solar Terrestrial Relation Observatory/Extreme-Ultraviolet Imager and Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. The observed light curves are matched with simulated light curves using an Artificial Neural Network, and the parameter values are determined across the active region, quiet Sun, and coronal hole. The damping rate of nanoflares is compared with the radiative losses cooling time. The effect of background emission, data cadence, and network sensitivity on the key parameters of the model is studied. Most of the observed light curves have a power-law exponent, _, greater than the critical value 2. At these sites, nanoflare heating could be significant.","Light curves in the EUV band have been analysed also with a different approach: they have been compared to simulated ones obtained from sequences of random pulses with powerlaw distribution (#AUTHOR_TAG and Safari, 2012).","['Loop light curves have been systematically analysed also in the EUV band.', 'A systematic tendency has been found to have ordered time lags from channels sensitive to emission from hotter plasma to cooler plasma, that is also evidence for dominant cooling Klimchuk, 2011, 2012).', 'Light curves in the EUV band have been analysed also with a different approach: they have been compared to simulated ones obtained from sequences of random pulses with powerlaw distribution (#AUTHOR_TAG and Safari, 2012).', 'Artificial neural network (ANN) was used for the comparison and it was found many that light curves are matched by those generated from events power-laws with a steep index (__� 2).', 'While studying the long-term evolution of active regions on the large scale, it was found that active regions show less and less variability as they age (Ugarte-Urra and Warren, 2012), thus suggesting a qualitative change of heating frequency with time.', 'At the other extreme of the smallest scales, the Hi-C observations show in some moss regions variability on timescales down to ___ 15 s, that may indicate the presence of heating pulses of comparable duration.']",5,"['Light curves in the EUV band have been analysed also with a different approach: they have been compared to simulated ones obtained from sequences of random pulses with powerlaw distribution (#AUTHOR_TAG and Safari, 2012).']"

CC2262,81800077,Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma,Fabio Reale,Some implications of the nanoflare concept,"[""Peter J. Cargill""]","The concept that the corona is heated by small flares (named 'nanoflares' by Parker) is examined. A model in which the closed, active region corona is comprised of many hundred of small elemental flux loops randomly heated by nanoflares is presentd. The cooling of these flux loops is examined using analytic techniques. It is assumed that the heated loops cool initially by conduction and at later times by radiation. Radiative cooling with and without downward mass flows are discussed, the experimental signature of such a coronal model are predicted. The distribution of temperatures in these loops peaks at around 2 x 106 K, while the distribution of densities peaks above 1010/cu cm. For 2 x 105 K less than T less than 106 K, radiative cooling with mass flows gives an emission measure that scales as T1.5, in agreement with existing observations. For T greater than 106 K, the emission measure increases more steeply, scaling as T4.5. These scalings are entirely due to the temperature dependence of the radiative loss function. It is shown that such a loop model has filling factors (defined as the ratio of the volume of hot plasma to the total volume) of order unity for subarcsecond energy release scales. A brief survey of the dependence of the results on the parameters of the system is presented. The temperature distribution function and emission measure are relatively insensitive to the loop length, coronal energy loss, number of elemental loops, and nanoflare energy, but the filling factor is dependent on these quantities. A simple scaling for this dependence is presented.","Models of loops made of thousands of nanoflare-heated strands were developed and applied to derive detailed predictions (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1994).","['Models of loops made of thousands of nanoflare-heated strands were developed and applied to derive detailed predictions (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1994).', 'In particular, whereas the loop total emission measure distribution should steepen above the canonical 1.5 (Jordan, 1980;Orlando et al., 2000;Peres et al., 2001) dependence for temperature above 1 MK.', 'Moreover, it was stressed the importance of the dependence of effects such as the plasma dynamics (filling and draining) on the loop filling factor driven by the elemental heat pulse size (Section 4.1.2).', 'The nanoflare model was early applied to the heating of coronal loops observed by Yohkoh (Cargill and Klimchuk, 1997).', 'A good match was found only for hot (4 MK) loops, with filling factors less than 0.1, so that it was hypothesized the existence of two distinct classes of hot loops.']",5,"['Models of loops made of thousands of nanoflare-heated strands were developed and applied to derive detailed predictions (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1994).']"

Bradshaw"", ""P. J. Cargill""]","The effect of the numerical spatial resolution in models of the solar corona and corona / chromosphere interface is examined for impulsive heating over a range of magnitudes using one dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. It is demonstrated that the principle effect of inadequate resolution is on the coronal density. An underresolved loop typically has a peak density of at least a factor of two lower than a resolved loop subject to the same heating, with larger discrepencies in the decay phase. The temperature for under-resolved loops is also lower indicating that lack of resolution does not ""bottle up"" the heat flux in the corona. Energy is conserved in the models to under 1% in all cases, indicating that this is not responsible for the low density. Instead, we argue that in under-resolved loops the heat flux ""jumps across"" the transition region to the dense chromosphere from which it is radiated rather than heating and ablating transition region plasma. This emphasises the point that the interaction between corona and chromosphere occurs only through the medium of the transition region. Implications for three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic coronal models are discussed.","It has been shown that time-dependent loop models must include a relatively thick, cool, and dense chromosphere and the transition region for a correct description of the mass transfer driven by transient heating (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG and Cargill, 2013) and to maintain the necessary numerical stability (Antiochos, 1979;Hood and Priest, 1980;Peres et al., 1982).","['The models require to be provided with initial loop conditions and boundary conditions.', 'It has been shown that time-dependent loop models must include a relatively thick, cool, and dense chromosphere and the transition region for a correct description of the mass transfer driven by transient heating (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG and Cargill, 2013) and to maintain the necessary numerical stability (Antiochos, 1979;Hood and Priest, 1980;Peres et al., 1982).', 'The main role of the chromosphere is only that of a mass reservoir and, therefore, in several codes, it is treated as simply as possible, e.g., an isothermal inactive layer that neither emits, nor conducts heat.', 'In other cases, a more accurate description is chosen, e.g., including a detailed chromospheric model (e.g., Vernazza et al., 1981), maintaining a simplified radiative emission and a detailed energy balance with an ad hoc heat input (Peres et al., 1982;Reale et al., 2000a).', 'Overall, a typical loop initial condition is a hydrostatic atmosphere with a temperature distribution from ___ 10 4 K to > 10 6 K, basically dictated by a thermal conduction profile (Figure 14).', 'The lower boundary of the computational domain is typically not involved in the evolution of the loop plasma.', 'Many loop models assume mirror symmetry with respect to the apex and, therefore, describe only half of the loop.', 'The upper boundary conditions are those of symmetry at the loop apex.']",5,"['It has been shown that time-dependent loop models must include a relatively thick, cool, and dense chromosphere and the transition region for a correct description of the mass transfer driven by transient heating (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG and Cargill, 2013) and to maintain the necessary numerical stability (Antiochos, 1979;Hood and Priest, 1980;Peres et al., 1982).']"

Also, the DEM curves obtained using lines calculated with an isothermal plasma and with a Gaussian distribution with FWHM of log T = 0.05 are very similar. Two near-isothermal components can be resolved if their temperature separation is Delta log T = 0.2 or larger. Thus, DEM diagnostics has an intrinsic resolving power of log T = 0.05. Atomic data uncertainties may significantly affect both temperature and peak DEM values, but do not alter our conclusions. The availability of small sets of lines also does not worsen the performance of the MCMC technique, provided these lines are formed in a wide temperature range.

Aims.We study the physics associated with nanoflare heating in this scenario and aim to determine whether there exist any observable signatures.         Methods.We derive an analytical model in order to gain some simple physical insights into the system and use a one dimensional hydrodynamic model that treats the electrons and ions as a coupled fluid to simulate nanoflare heating with time-scales of 30 s. Our analytical model also provide a means of verifying our numerical results.         Results.We find that diffuse loops containing plasma at $T>$ 20 MK can be rapidly created and subsequently filled by the violent evaporation of chromospheric plasma driven by near-saturated thermal conduction. Most importantly, we find order-of-magnitude departures from equilibrium of the ionisation balance for iron and use this result to identify a potential signature of this heating mechanism.         Conclusions.We conclude that nanoflare heating can account for the presence of extremely high temperature plasma in a corona with low filling factor. We find that near-saturated thermal conduction may play a key role at the onset of chromospheric evaporation and a non-equilibrium ionisation balance is absolutely inevitable. The high temperatures could never be directly measured in the corona due to the small emission measure and the most promising signature of such heating is blue-shifted plasma from the loop footpoints.

Davila""]","Quasi-periodic propagating intensity disturbances (PDs) have been observed in large coronal loops in EUV images over a decade, and are widely accepted to be slow magnetosonic waves. However, spectroscopic observations from Hinode/EIS revealed their association with persistent coronal upflows, making this interpretation debatable. Motivated by the scenario that the coronal upflows could be cumulative result of numerous individual flow pulses generated by sporadic heating events (nanoflares) at the loop base, we construct a velocity driver with repetitive tiny pulses, whose energy frequency distribution follows the flare power-law scaling. We then perform 3D MHD modeling of an idealized bipolar active region by applying this broadband velocity driver at the footpoints of large coronal loops which appear open in the computational domain. Our model successfully reproduces the PDs with similar features as the observed, and shows that any upflow pulses inevitably excite slow magnetosonic wave disturbances propagating along the loop. We find that the generated PDs are dominated by the wave signature as their propagation speeds are consistent with the wave speed in the presence of flows, and the injected flows rapidly decelerate with height. Our simulation results suggest that the observed PDs and associated persistent upflows may be produced by small-scale impulsive heating events (nanoflares) at the loop base, and that the flows and waves may both contribute to the PDs at lower heights.","In some of these studies, for instance, seismological techniques are used in order to measure flare-induced loop oscillations (Ballai et al., 2011) and waves and flows in active region loops (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013;Uritsky et al., 2013).","['Coronal loops are magnetic structures and might therefore be mapped easily and safely by mapping reliably the coronal magnetic field.', 'Unfortunately, it is well-known that it is very difficult to measure the magnetic field in the corona, and it can be done only in very special conditions, e.g., very strong local field (White et al., 1991).', 'In some cases it is possible to use coronal seismology (first proposed by Uchida, 1970) to determine the average magnetic field strength in an oscillating loop, first used by Nakariakov et al.

Each of the loop strands used in this model can independently be heated (near their left footpoints) by Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron waves via wave-particle interactions. The Alfv\'en waves are assumed to penetrate the strands from their footpoints, at which we consider different wave energy inputs. As a result, the loop strands can have different heating profiles, and the differential heating can lead to a varying cross-field temperature in the total coronal loop. The simulation of TRACE observations by means of this loop model implies two uniform temperatures along the loop length, one inferred from the 171:195 filter ratio and the other from the 171:284 ratio. The reproduced flat temperature profiles are consistent with those inferred from the observed EUV coronal loops. According to our model, the flat temperature profile is a consequence of the coronal loop consisting of filaments, which have different temperatures but almost similar emission measures in the cross-field direction. Furthermore, when we assume certain errors in the simulated loop emissions (e.g., due to photometric uncertainties in the TRACE filters) and use the triple-filter analysis, our simulated loop conditions become consistent with those of an isothermal plasma. This implies that the use of TRACE/EIT triple filters for observation of a warm coronal loop may not help in determining whether the cross-field isothermal assumption is satisfied or not","One such model addressed the evidence of flat TRACE/EIT filter-ratios along loops that were explained by the multi-filament loop structure (#AUTHOR_TAG and Marsch, 2010).","['The description of loops as bundles of strands applies also to models that include heating by the dissipation of MHD waves (Alfvͩn/ion-cyclotron waves -particles).', 'One such model addressed the evidence of flat TRACE/EIT filter-ratios along loops that were explained by the multi-filament loop structure (#AUTHOR_TAG and Marsch, 2010).', 'Transverse oscillations and flows were observed in multi-stranded loops (Ofman and Wang, 2008;Wang et al., 2012).', 'Multi-stranded loop models Living Reviews in Solar Physics http://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4', 'were used in 3D MHD studies of transverse loop oscillations (e.g., Ofman, 2009) and in MHD normal mode analysis (e.g., Luna et al., 2010).']",5,"['One such model addressed the evidence of flat TRACE/EIT filter-ratios along loops that were explained by the multi-filament loop structure (#AUTHOR_TAG and Marsch, 2010).', 'Transverse oscillations and flows were observed in multi-stranded loops (Ofman and Wang, 2008;Wang et al., 2012).']"

From the observations we establish empirical scaling laws for the flare loop length, L(T)_T, the electron density, n e(T)_T 2, from which we derive scaling laws for the loop pressure, p(T)_T 3, and the thermal energy, E th_T 6. Extrapolating these scaling laws into the picoflare regime we find that the pressure conditions in the chromosphere constrain a height level for flare loop footpoints, which scales with h eq(T)_T _0.5. Based on this chromospheric pressure limit we predict a lower cutoff of flare loop sizes at L _min_5 Mm and flare energies E _min_1024 erg. We show evidence for such a rollover in the flare energy size distribution from recent TRACE EUV data.

The loop oscillation event occurred on 2011 March 8, triggered by a coronal mass ejection (CME). The multiwavelength analysis reveals the presence of multithermal strands in the oscillating loop, whose dynamic behaviors are temperature-dependent, showing differences in their oscillation amplitudes, phases, and emission evolution. The physical parameters of growing oscillations of two strands in 171  are measured and the three-dimensional loop geometry is determined using STEREO-A/EUVI data. These strands have very similar frequencies, and between two 193  strands a quarter-period phase delay sets up. These features suggest the coupling between kink oscillations of neighboring strands and the interpretation by the collective kink mode as predicted by some models. However, the temperature dependence of the multistranded loop oscillations was not studied previously and needs further investigation. The transverse loop oscillations are associated with intensity and loop width variations. We suggest that the amplitude-growing kink oscillations may be a result of continuous non-periodic driving by magnetic deformation of the CME, which deposits energy into the loop system at a rate faster than its loss.","Undamped, or even growing waves were observed by SDO/AIA (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012;Nistic�_ et al., 2013).","['Widespread evidence for outward propagation of Alfvͩn waves is reported from ground optical polarimetric observations (Tomczyk et al., 2007), and non-thermal broadening has been shown to correlate  with swaying motions detected in the corona from SDO/AIA data (speed of ___ 20 km s -1 and periods of few minutes) (McIntosh et al., 2011).', 'TRACE EUV observations provided the first evidence of resolved transverse waves in coronal loops (Aschwanden et al., 1999a;Nakariakov et al., 1999;Nakariakov and Ofman, 2001).', 'Undamped, or even growing waves were observed by SDO/AIA (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012;Nistic�_ et al., 2013).', 'Transverse waves were detected also in high resolution observations with the HiC in thin loops (__� 100 km) at low speed amplitude (Morton and McLaughlin, 2013).', 'The contribution of this class of waves is estimated, discussed, and debated although there is still no clear convergence.', 'Other oscillations were observed to propagate along coronal loops at more than 100 km s -1 with periods of a few minutes and interpreted as slow magnetosonic waves (De Moortel et al., 2000), but also as due to faint upflows (De Pontieu and McIntosh, 2010).', 'We mention that also much faster (> 1000 km s -1 ) propagating oscillations were detected in SDO/AIA observations during eruptive events and interpreted as fast magnetosonic waves (e.g., Liu et al., 2011;Ofman et al., 2011).']",5,"['Undamped, or even growing waves were observed by SDO/AIA (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012;Nistic�_ et al., 2013).']"

We use potential field extrapolations to compute magnetic field lines and populate these field lines with solutions to the hydrostatic loop equations assuming steady, uniform heating. Our volumetric heating rates are of the form _H~Bø_/L_, where Bø is the magnetic field strength averaged along a field line and L is the loop length. Comparisons between the observed and simulated emission for 26 active regions suggest that coronal heating models that scale as _H~Bø/L are in the closest agreement with the observed emission at high temperatures. The field-braiding reconnection model of Parker, for example, is consistent with our results. We find, however, that the integrated intensities alone are insufficient to uniquely determine the parameterization of the volumetric heating rate. Visualizations of the emission are also needed.

Such hot plasma is hardly detected in quiet and active regions, outside flares. During rapid and short heat pulses in rarefied loops, the plasma can be highly out of equilibrium in ionization. Here we investigate the effects of the nonequilibrium of ionization (NEI) on the detection of hot plasma in coronal loops. Time-dependent loop hydrodynamic simulations are specifically devoted to this task, including saturated thermal conduction, and coupled to the detailed solution of the equations of the ionization rate for several abundant elements. In our simulations, initially cool and rarefied magnetic flux tubes are heated to 10 MK by nanoflares deposited either at the footpoints or at the loop apex. We test for different pulse durations and find that, due to NEI effects, the loop plasma may never be detected at temperatures above ~5 MK for heat pulses shorter than about 1 minute.

These infections evoke incomplete immunity, as individuals can be repeatedly reinfected throughout life. We report that acute viral LRI causes rapid pulmonary CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (TCD8) functional impairment via programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) signaling, a pathway previously associated with prolonged antigenic stimulation during chronic infections and cancer. PD-1-mediated TCD8 impairment occurred acutely in mice following infection with human metapneumovirus or influenza virus. Viral antigen was sufficient for PD-1 upregulation, but induction of PD-L1 was required for impairment. During secondary viral infection or epitope-only challenge, memory TCD8 rapidly reexpressed PD-1 and exhibited severe functional impairment. Inhibition of PD-1 signaling using monoclonal antibody blockade prevented TCD8 impairment, reduced viral titers during primary infection, and enhanced protection of immunized mice against challenge infection.

The lung tissues of 37 of these cases were positive for influenza viral antigens or viral RNA, including four from the prepandemic period (May-August). The prepandemic and pandemic peak cases were indistinguishable clinically and pathologically. All 68 cases had histological evidence of bacterial pneumonia, and 94% showed abundant bacteria on Gram stain. Sequence analysis of the viral hemagglutinin receptor-binding domain performed on RNA from 13 cases suggested a trend from a more ""avian-like"" viral receptor specificity with G222 in prepandemic cases to a more ""human-like"" specificity associated with D222 in pandemic peak cases. Viral antigen distribution in the respiratory tree, however, was not apparently different between prepandemic and pandemic peak cases, or between infections with viruses bearing different receptor-binding polymorphisms. The 1918 pandemic virus was circulating for at least 4 mo in the United States before it was recognized epidemiologically in September 1918. The causes of the unusually high mortality in the 1918 pandemic were not explained by the pathological and virological parameters examined.

The concentration of TNF-alpha protein in culture supernatants of macrophages infected with these viruses was similar to that induced by stimulation with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. The non-structural (NS) gene-segment of H5N1/97 viruses contributed to the increase in TNF alpha induced by the virus.The H5N1/97 viruses are potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages, the most notable being TNF alpha.

Kieseier"", ""Lieping Chen"", ""Hans-Peter Hartung"", ""Michael Weller"", ""Heinz Wiendl""]","Antigen-presenting cells (APC) are considered to play a critical role in promoting the (re)activation of potentially autoreactive T cells in multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). B7-H1 (PD-L1) is a novel member of the B7 family proteins which exert costimulatory and immune regulatory functions. Here we characterize the expression and functional activity of B7-H1 expressed on monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) of healthy donors and MS patients. B7-H1 is constitutively expressed on monocytes and differentially matured DC, but not on B cells. IFN-beta, the principle immune modulatory agent used for the treatment of MS, strongly enhances B7-H1 expression on monocytes and semi-matured DC, but not B cells, in vitro. Importantly, B7-H1 expressed on APC strongly inhibits autologous CD4 T-cell activation. Neutralization of B7-H1 on monocytes or differentially matured monocyte-derived DC markedly increases the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFN-gamma and IL-2, T-cell proliferation, and the expression of T-cell activation markers. B7-H1 exhibits strong inhibitory effects when expressed on monocytes, immature or semi-mature DC, but less so when expressed on fully matured DC. B7-H1-dependent immune inhibition is in part mediated by CD4/CD25+ regulatory T cells. There is no difference in the baseline expression levels of monocytic B7-H1 between untreated MS patients and healthy donors. However, both groups show a significant concentration-dependent up-regulation of B7-H1 mRNA and protein in response to IFN-beta in vitro. Serial measurements of B7-H1 mRNA in MS patients before and 6 months after initiation of IFN-beta therapy corroborated the relevance of these results in vivo: Nine of nine patients showed a significant increase in B7-H1 mRNA levels after 6 months of IFN-beta therapy (median 1.04 vs. 8.78; p<0.05, two-sided t-test). Accordingly, protein expression of B7-H1 on monocytes was up-regulated after 24 h of IFN-beta application. In summary, B7-H1 expressed on APC acts as a strong inhibitor of autologous CD4 T-cell activation and may thus contribute to the maintenance of peripheral immune tolerance. IFN-beta up-regulates B7-H1 in vitro and in MS patients in vivo and might represent a novel mechanism how IFN-beta acts as a negative modulator on APC T-cell interactions in the periphery.","Since type I IFN expression was observed in response to influenza infection and previous studies have suggested that these cytokines could induce PDL1 expression [18,#AUTHOR_TAG], we investigated whether rhIFN�_ could induce PDL1 gene expression in our MDM model (Fig. 7A).","['Since type I IFN expression was observed in response to influenza infection and previous studies have suggested that these cytokines could induce PDL1 expression [18,#AUTHOR_TAG], we investigated whether rhIFN�_ could induce PDL1 gene expression in our MDM model (Fig. 7A).', 'We observed a dose dependent-increase in PDL1 steady-state mRNA expression in response to IFN�_ after 24 h.', 'Using 50 IU of rhIFN�_ we saw a 2.9-fold increase in PDL1 gene expression increasing to 4.3-fold at 100 IU of this cytokine.']",0,"['Since type I IFN expression was observed in response to influenza infection and previous studies have suggested that these cytokines could induce PDL1 expression [18,#AUTHOR_TAG], we investigated whether rhIFN�_ could induce PDL1 gene expression in our MDM model (Fig. 7A).']"

A particularly interesting mAb was mAb DF272. It recognizes monocyte-derived DC, but not blood monocytes or lymphocytes, and has profound immunomodulatory effects on DC. Treatment of DC with intact IgG or Fab of mAb DF272 enhanced their T cell stimulatory capacity. This effect on DC was accompanied by neither an up-regulation of costimulatory molecules such as B7.1 (CD80), B7.2 (CD86), and MHC class II molecules nor by an induction of cytokine production, including IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-10, and IL-12. Moreover, the well-established inhibitory function of IL-10-treated DC could be reverted with mAb DF272. Even T cells, anergized because of stimulation with IL-10-treated DC, could be reactivated and induced to proliferate upon stimulation with mAb DF272-treated DC. Furthermore, mAb DF272-treated DC favored the induction of a type-1 cytokine response in T cells and inhibited IL-10 production. By using a retrovirus-based cDNA expression library generated from DC, we cloned and sequenced the mAb DF272-defined cell surface receptor and could demonstrate that it is identical with B7-H1 (programmed death-1 ligand), a recently identified new member of the B7 family of costimulatory molecules. Our results thus demonstrate that the mAb DF272-defined surface molecule B7-H1 represents a unique receptor structure on DC that might play a role in the induction and maintenance of T cell anergy.","Previous investigators have suggested that there is equilibrium between expression of these markers and the activation state, with inhibitory signalling being predominant when CD80/CD86 expression is low #AUTHOR_TAG.","['Expression of the T cell stimulatory molecules, HLA-DR and CD86, as well as the inhibitory PDL1 protein was induced on influenza-infected macrophages.', 'HLA-DR is a component of the Major Histocompatibility Class (MHC) II complex involved in antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells [25], whilst CD86 is classically associated with activation of the CD28 signalling pathway [26].', 'Why the infected macrophage should upregulate both stimulatory and inhibitory signals at the same time and the functional significance of this is open for speculation.', 'Previous investigators have suggested that there is equilibrium between expression of these markers and the activation state, with inhibitory signalling being predominant when CD80/CD86 expression is low #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Selenko-Gebauer et al (2003) hypothesised that PDL1 expression may function as an immunological rheostat to set a T cell activation threshold [27].', 'One further possibility is suggested by the fact that both CD80 and CD86 can induce signalling by the inhibitory CTLA-4 receptor on T cells as well as activating the CD28 pathway [28], therefore an inhibitory milieu may be propagated via the infected macrophage.', 'This may be especially important in the lung as unconstrained inflammation can lead to lung function impairment and death [6].']",3,"['Expression of the T cell stimulatory molecules, HLA-DR and CD86, as well as the inhibitory PDL1 protein was induced on influenza-infected macrophages.', 'HLA-DR is a component of the Major Histocompatibility Class (MHC) II complex involved in antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells [25], whilst CD86 is classically associated with activation of the CD28 signalling pathway [26].', 'Why the infected macrophage should upregulate both stimulatory and inhibitory signals at the same time and the functional significance of this is open for speculation.', 'Previous investigators have suggested that there is equilibrium between expression of these markers and the activation state, with inhibitory signalling being predominant when CD80/CD86 expression is low #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Selenko-Gebauer et al (2003) hypothesised that PDL1 expression may function as an immunological rheostat to set a T cell activation threshold [27].', 'One further possibility is suggested by the fact that both CD80 and CD86 can induce signalling by the inhibitory CTLA-4 receptor on T cells as well as activating the CD28 pathway [28], therefore an inhibitory milieu may be propagated via the infected macrophage.']"

Sharpe""]","The discovery of new functions for the original B7 family members, together with the identification of additional B7 and CD28 family members, have revealed new ways in which the B7:CD28 family regulates T cell activation and tolerance. B7-1/B7-2:CD28 interactions not only promote initial T cell activation but also regulate self-tolerance by supporting CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell homeostasis. CTLA-4 can exert its inhibitory effects in both B7-1/B7-2 dependent and independent fashions. B7-1 and B7-2 can signal bidirectionally by engaging CD28 and CTLA-4 on T cells and by delivering signals into B7-expressing cells. The five new B7 family members, ICOS ligand, PD-L1 (B7-H1), PD-L2 (B7-DC), B7-H3, and B7-H4 (B7x/B7-S1) are expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells as well as on cells within nonlymphoid organs, providing new means for regulating T cell activation and tolerance in peripheral tissues. The new CD28 families members, ICOS, PD-1, and BTLA, are inducibly expressed on T cells, and they have important roles in regulating previously activated T cells. PD-1 and BTLA also are expressed on B cells and may have broader immunoregulatory functions. The ICOS:ICOSL pathway appears to be particularly important for stimulating effector T cell responses and T cell-dependent B cell responses, but it also has an important role in regulating T cell tolerance. In addition, the PD-1:PD-L1/PD-L2 pathway plays a critical role in regulating T cell activation and tolerance. In this review, we revisit the roles of the B7:CD28 family members in regulating immune responses, and we discuss their therapeutic potential.","HLA-DR is a component of the Major Histocompatibility Class (MHC) II complex involved in antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells [25], whilst CD86 is classically associated with activation of the CD28 signalling pathway #AUTHOR_TAG.","['Expression of the T cell stimulatory molecules, HLA-DR and CD86, as well as the inhibitory PDL1 protein was induced on influenza-infected macrophages.', 'HLA-DR is a component of the Major Histocompatibility Class (MHC) II complex involved in antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells [25], whilst CD86 is classically associated with activation of the CD28 signalling pathway #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Why the infected macrophage should upregulate both stimulatory and inhibitory signals at the same time and the functional significance of this is open for speculation.', 'Previous investigators have suggested that there is equilibrium between expression of these markers and the activation state, with inhibitory signalling being predominant when CD80/CD86 expression is low [27].', 'Selenko-Gebauer et al (2003) hypothesised that PDL1 expression may function as an immunological rheostat to set a T cell activation threshold [27].', 'One further possibility is suggested by the fact that both CD80 and CD86 can induce signalling by the inhibitory CTLA-4 receptor on T cells as well as activating the CD28 pathway [28], therefore an inhibitory milieu may be propagated via the infected macrophage.', 'This may be especially important in the lung as unconstrained inflammation can lead to lung function impairment and death [6].']",0,"['HLA-DR is a component of the Major Histocompatibility Class (MHC) II complex involved in antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells [25], whilst CD86 is classically associated with activation of the CD28 signalling pathway #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Why the infected macrophage should upregulate both stimulatory and inhibitory signals at the same time and the functional significance of this is open for speculation.', 'Previous investigators have suggested that there is equilibrium between expression of these markers and the activation state, with inhibitory signalling being predominant when CD80/CD86 expression is low [27].']"

We now report that pulmonary interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) produced during T cell responses to influenza infection in mice inhibits initial bacterial clearance from the lung by alveolar macrophages. This suppression of phagocytosis correlates with lung IFN-gamma abundance, but not viral burden, and leads to enhanced susceptibility to secondary pneumococcal infection, which can be prevented by IFN-gamma neutralization after influenza infection. Direct inoculation of IFN-gamma can mimic influenza infection and downregulate the expression of the class A scavenger receptor MARCO on alveolar macrophages.

Agrewala""]","Some of the most successful pathogens of human, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), HIV, and Leishmania donovani not only establish chronic infections but also remain a grave global threat. These pathogens have developed innovative strategies to evade immune responses such as antigenic shift and drift, interference with antigen processing/presentation, subversion of phagocytosis, induction of immune regulatory pathways, and manipulation of the costimulatory molecules. Costimulatory molecules expressed on the surface of various cells play a decisive role in the initiation and sustenance of immunity. Exploitation of the ""code of conduct"" of costimulation pathways provides evolutionary incentive to the pathogens and thereby abates the functioning of the immune system. Here we review how Mtb, HIV, Leishmania sp., and other pathogens manipulate costimulatory molecules to establish chronic infection. Impairment by pathogens in the signaling events delivered by costimulatory molecules may be responsible for defective T-cell responses; consequently organisms grow unhindered in the host cells. This review summarizes the convergent devices that pathogens employ to tune and tame the immune system using costimulatory molecules. Studying host-pathogen interaction in context with costimulatory signals may unveil the molecular mechanism that will help in understanding the survival/death of the pathogens. We emphasize that the very same pathways can potentially be exploited to develop immunotherapeutic strategies to eliminate intracellular pathogens.","Or, as has been suggested for HIV, this mechanism has been subverted by the virus to prevent viral clearance #AUTHOR_TAG.","['In conclusion, PDL1 expression is a primary response of monocytes/macrophages to viral infection, whether that be in the liver [11], the blood [34] or the lung [7].', 'Moreover the role of IFNs in upregulating PDL1 is not confined to monocytes/macrophages as IFN�� and IFN�_ have both been shown to increase expression of PDL1 in hepatocytes [35].', 'Taken together with our data using influenza and RSV, we suggest that this increased PDL1 expression is a common host response to infection by different virus families.', 'The question remains as to why this host response mechanism in response to virus has developed and what its functional significance is?', 'Perhaps it is a means by which anti-viral responses can be restrained before the resulting inflammation can cause too much tissue damage, as has been suggested in the liver [36].', 'Or, as has been suggested for HIV, this mechanism has been subverted by the virus to prevent viral clearance #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'In terms of influenza, PDL1 co-inhibition of virus-specific memory T cells may explain the partial responses to immunization and poor cross protection from one influenza season to the next.']",0,"['Or, as has been suggested for HIV, this mechanism has been subverted by the virus to prevent viral clearance #AUTHOR_TAG.']"

The reason for this discrepancy is not known. In this study, it was found that prior influenza virus infection inhibits murine alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of S. aureus but not of E. coli.

Because such defects may represent abnormalities in ingestion or inactivation of inhaled bacteria, these subcomponents of phagocytosis were tested in mice infected 5 days previously with influenza A virus (NWS or WSN). The mice were exposed to aerosols of Staphylococcus epidermidis and then the rates of bacterial inactivation and percentages of intracellularly located staphylococci were measured. Rates of bacterial inactivation were determined for the left lung by pour-plate enumeration methods. The percentage of ingested bacteria was determined in the in situ perfused right lung by histologically determining the intra- or extracellular location of 100 or more staphylococci. Rates of inactivation of S. epidermidis at 4 hours after bacterial challenge were: control, 90.1 per cent; WSN, 73.0 per cent; NWS, 68.6 per cent, P less than 0.01. The percentage of intracellular staphylococci at 4 hours were: control, 90.9 per cent; WSN, 69.9 per cent; and NWS, 73.8 per cent, P less than 0.01. Microcolonies of proliferating staphylococci were also observed within macrophages of mice infected with each strain of influenza. These experiments demonstrated that in this experimental model, influenzal infection impairs the inactivation of inhaled bacteria by retarding the ingestion of bacteria and by allowing bacteria to proliferate within macrophages.","Influenza infection of the airway is known to affect the macrophage functions of phagocytosis and bacterial killing #AUTHOR_TAG, but the question as to whether this was mediated by exogenous factors or by infection of the macrophages themselves has remained open.","['Influenza infection of the airway is known to affect the macrophage functions of phagocytosis and bacterial killing #AUTHOR_TAG, but the question as to whether this was mediated by exogenous factors or by infection of the macrophages themselves has remained open.', 'Early studies demonstrated that virus-induced suppression of antibacterial defences was mediated by lymphocytes [21].', 'Subsequent studies have suggested that it is the cytokines released by lymphocytes, such as IFN�_ and IL-10 that mediate the suppressive effects of virus [1,[22][23][24].', 'However, as influenza can infect and replicate in human alveolar macrophages [1], the reciprocal effects of influenza-infected macrophages on lymphocyte function have remained largely unexplored.', 'The recent study by Erickson et al (2012) demonstrating that influenza infection of the lung can upregulate PDL1 expression on both the airway epithelium and macrophages and that this upregulation directly reduces CD8 T cell effector function highlights the dynamic relationship between infected macrophages and T cells [7].', 'In contrast to this previous study we did not observe an up-regulation in epithelial PDL1 expression in response to influenza infection.', 'However, Erickson et al (2012) analysed post-mortem lung samples from individuals with severe influenza infection and thus the epithelial PDL1 expression observed may be at a more advanced stage of infection than our acute infection model can reflect [7].', 'Furthermore, our data suggest the importance of macrophage PDL1 expression controlling T cell responses earlier on in infection.']",0,"['Influenza infection of the airway is known to affect the macrophage functions of phagocytosis and bacterial killing #AUTHOR_TAG, but the question as to whether this was mediated by exogenous factors or by infection of the macrophages themselves has remained open.']"

We established a mouse model to study postinfluenza pneumococcal pneumonia and evaluated the role of IL-10 in host defense against Streptococcus pneumoniae after recovery from influenza infection. C57BL/6 mice were intranasally inoculated with 10 median tissue culture infective doses of influenza A (A/PR/8/34) or PBS (control) on day 0. By day 14 mice had regained their normal body weight and had cleared influenza virus from the lungs, as determined by real-time quantitative PCR. On day 14 after viral infection, mice received 10(4) CFU of S. pneumoniae (serotype 3) intranasally. Mice recovered from influenza infection were highly susceptible to subsequent pneumococcal pneumonia, as reflected by a 100% lethality on day 3 after bacterial infection, whereas control mice showed 17% lethality on day 3 and 83% lethality on day 6 after pneumococcal infection. Furthermore, 1000-fold higher bacterial counts at 48 h after infection with S. pneumoniae and, particularly, 50-fold higher pulmonary levels of IL-10 were observed in influenza-recovered mice than in control mice. Treatment with an anti-IL-10 mAb 1 h before bacterial inoculation resulted in reduced bacterial outgrowth and markedly reduced lethality during secondary bacterial pneumonia compared with those in IgG1 control mice. In conclusion, mild self-limiting influenza A infection renders normal immunocompetent mice highly susceptible to pneumococcal pneumonia. This increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonia is at least in part caused by excessive IL-10 production and reduced neutrophil function in the lungs.","Subsequent studies have suggested that it is the cytokines released by lymphocytes, such as IFN�_ and IL-10 that mediate the suppressive effects of virus [1,#AUTHOR_TAG[23][24].","['Influenza infection of the airway is known to affect the macrophage functions of phagocytosis and bacterial killing [20], but the question as to whether this was mediated by exogenous factors or by infection of the macrophages themselves has remained open.', 'Early studies demonstrated that virus-induced suppression of antibacterial defences was mediated by lymphocytes [21].', 'Subsequent studies have suggested that it is the cytokines released by lymphocytes, such as IFN�_ and IL-10 that mediate the suppressive effects of virus [1,#AUTHOR_TAG[23][24].', 'However, as influenza can infect and replicate in human alveolar macrophages [1], the reciprocal effects of influenza-infected macrophages on lymphocyte function have remained largely unexplored.', 'The recent study by Erickson et al (2012) demonstrating that influenza infection of the lung can upregulate PDL1 expression on both the airway epithelium and macrophages and that this upregulation directly reduces CD8 T cell effector function highlights the dynamic relationship between infected macrophages and T cells [7].', 'In contrast to this previous study we did not observe an up-regulation in epithelial PDL1 expression in response to influenza infection.', 'However, Erickson et al (2012) analysed post-mortem lung samples from individuals with severe influenza infection and thus the epithelial PDL1 expression observed may be at a more advanced stage of infection than our acute infection model can reflect [7].', 'Furthermore, our data suggest the importance of macrophage PDL1 expression controlling T cell responses earlier on in infection.']",0,"['Influenza infection of the airway is known to affect the macrophage functions of phagocytosis and bacterial killing [20], but the question as to whether this was mediated by exogenous factors or by infection of the macrophages themselves has remained open.', 'Early studies demonstrated that virus-induced suppression of antibacterial defences was mediated by lymphocytes [21].', 'Subsequent studies have suggested that it is the cytokines released by lymphocytes, such as IFN�_ and IL-10 that mediate the suppressive effects of virus [1,#AUTHOR_TAG[23][24].', 'However, as influenza can infect and replicate in human alveolar macrophages [1], the reciprocal effects of influenza-infected macrophages on lymphocyte function have remained largely unexplored.', 'The recent study by Erickson et al (2012) demonstrating that influenza infection of the lung can upregulate PDL1 expression on both the airway epithelium and macrophages and that this upregulation directly reduces CD8 T cell effector function highlights the dynamic relationship between infected macrophages and T cells [7].', 'In contrast to this previous study we did not observe an up-regulation in epithelial PDL1 expression in response to influenza infection.', 'However, Erickson et al (2012) analysed post-mortem lung samples from individuals with severe influenza infection and thus the epithelial PDL1 expression observed may be at a more advanced stage of infection than our acute infection model can reflect [7].']"

To determine the degree of involvement of the host response in influenza virus-induced impairment of pulmonary antibacterial defenses, mice were immunosuppressed by treatment with antilymphocyte serum (ALS). Eight days after infection, pulmonary defense mechanisms were quantitated by aerogenic challenge with Staphylococcus aureus; the ingestion of opsonized erythrocyte (EA) was used to monitor the phagocytic capability of alveolar macrophages obtained by pulmonary lavage. The ALS treatment alone caused no significant alteration in pulmonary antibacterial defenses or macrophage phagocytosis, nor did it interfere with viral multiplication. In noninfected lungs, less than 1% of the initial viable staphylococci remained viable at 24 h compared with proliferation to 490 +/- 147% in virus-infected lungs. Treatment with ALS prevented staphylococcal multiplication, the bactericidal value being 28 +/- 12% at the same time period. The phagocytic index (EA ingested/100 macrophages) in cells retrieved from normal lungs was 783 +/- 22 compared with 235 +/- 29 in macrophages from virus-infected lungs. The ALS ameliorated the impairment in phagocytic ingestion, the index being 505 +/- 34. Incubation of alveolar macrophages from virus-infected, ALS-treated animals with specific viral antibody reestablished the phagocytic defect in a dose-dependent manner; the index being 215 +/- 30 at the lowest dilution of antiviral globulin.

We performed gene profiling of human AM in response to H1N1 influenza A virus PR/8 using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 chips and verified the changes at both mRNA and protein levels by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. We confirmed the response with a contemporary H3N2 influenza virus A/New York/238/2005 (NY/238). To understand the local cellular response, we also evaluated the impact of paracrine factors on virus-induced chemokine and cytokine secretion. In addition, we investigated the changes in the expression of macrophage receptors and uptake of pathogens after PR/8 infection. Although macrophages fail to release a large amount of infectious virus, we observed a robust induction of type I and type III interferons and several cytokines and chemokines following influenza infection. CXCL9, 10, and 11 were the most highly induced chemokines by influenza infection. UV-inactivation abolished virus-induced cytokine and chemokine response, with the exception of CXCL10. The contemporary influenza virus NY/238 infection of AM induced a similar response as PR/8. Inhibition of TNF and/or IL-1b activity significantly decreased the secretion of the proinflammatory chemokines CCL5 and CXCL8 by over 50%. PR/8 infection also significantly decreased mRNA levels of macrophage receptors including C-type lectin domain family 7 member A (CLEC7A), macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1), and CD36, and reduced uptake of zymosan.

The inhibitory molecule programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) has been shown to anergize human T(H)1 cells, but other mechanisms of PDL1-mediated T(H)1 inhibition such as the conversion of T(H)1 cells to a regulatory phenotype have not been well characterized. We hypothesized that PDL1 may cause T(H)1 cells to manifest differentiation plasticity. Conventional T cells or irradiated K562 myeloid tumor cells overexpressing PDL1 converted TBET(+) T(H)1 cells into FOXP3(+) regulatory T (T(reg)) cells in vivo, thereby preventing human-into-mouse xenogeneic GVHD (xGVHD). Either blocking PD1 expression on T(H)1 cells by small interfering RNA targeting or abrogation of PD1 signaling by SHP1/2 pharmacologic inhibition stabilized T(H)1 cell differentiation during PDL1 challenge and restored the capacity of T(H)1 cells to mediate lethal xGVHD. PD1 signaling therefore induces human T(H)1 cells to manifest in vivo plasticity, resulting in a T(reg) phenotype that severely impairs cell-mediated immunity. Converting human T(H)1 cells to a regulatory phenotype with PD1 signaling provides a potential way to block GVHD after transplantation. Moreover, because this conversion can be prevented by blocking PD1 expression or pharmacologically inhibiting SHP1/2, this pathway provides a new therapeutic direction for enhancing T cell immunity to cancer and infection.","However, it was only recently that a role for this PD1/PDL1 pathway has been elucidated in the control of immune function in acute infections and increased PDL1 expression in response to pathogens was demonstrated to be crucial for impairment of CD8 cytotoxicity [7] and the development of regulatory T cells #AUTHOR_TAG.","['Recent studies have suggested that macrophage expression of Programmed Death Ligand (PDL)-1 is important in regulating T cell responses to influenza infection [7].', 'PDL1 is the ligand for the Programmed Cell Death (PD) receptor 1, which is a member of the CD28 family of T cell receptors with CD80 and CD86 being ligands for CD28.', 'In the standard model of T cell receptor (TCR) activation, activation of CD28 provides a necessary co-stimulation to prevent T cell anergy [8].', 'In contrast, binding of PDL1 to PD1 causes inhibition of TCR-mediated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3Kinase) activation leading to inhibition of T cell proliferation and cytokine release [9].', 'The increased expression and activation of the PD1/PDL1 axis in chronic viral infections such as HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) can lead to progressive loss of T cell function [10,11].', 'However, it was only recently that a role for this PD1/PDL1 pathway has been elucidated in the control of immune function in acute infections and increased PDL1 expression in response to pathogens was demonstrated to be crucial for impairment of CD8 cytotoxicity [7] and the development of regulatory T cells #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'We have recently demonstrated that CD4 cytotoxic T cells play an important role in protecting against severe influenza infection.', 'This work demonstrated an additional role for MHC class II expressing cells and T helper cell responses [13] highlighting the potential importance of macrophage-T cell interactions in the control of influenza infection.']",0,"['However, it was only recently that a role for this PD1/PDL1 pathway has been elucidated in the control of immune function in acute infections and increased PDL1 expression in response to pathogens was demonstrated to be crucial for impairment of CD8 cytotoxicity [7] and the development of regulatory T cells #AUTHOR_TAG.']"

The inhibitory receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1; also known as PDCD1), a negative regulator of activated T cells, is markedly upregulated on the surface of exhausted virus-specific CD8 T cells in mice. Blockade of this pathway using antibodies against the PD ligand 1 (PD-L1, also known as CD274) restores CD8 T-cell function and reduces viral load. To investigate the role of PD-1 in a chronic human viral infection, we examined PD-1 expression on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific CD8 T cells in 71 clade-C-infected people who were naive to anti-HIV treatments, using ten major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I tetramers specific for frequently targeted epitopes. Here we report that PD-1 is significantly upregulated on these cells, and expression correlates with impaired HIV-specific CD8 T-cell function as well as predictors of disease progression: positively with plasma viral load and inversely with CD4 T-cell count. PD-1 expression on CD4 T cells likewise showed a positive correlation with viral load and an inverse correlation with CD4 T-cell count, and blockade of the pathway augmented HIV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell function. These data indicate that the immunoregulatory PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is operative during a persistent viral infection in humans, and define a reversible defect in HIV-specific T-cell function. Moreover, this pathway of reversible T-cell impairment provides a potential target for enhancing the function of exhausted T cells in chronic HIV infection.","The increased expression and activation of the PD1/PDL1 axis in chronic viral infections such as HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) can lead to progressive loss of T cell function [#AUTHOR_TAG,11].","['Recent studies have suggested that macrophage expression of Programmed Death Ligand (PDL)-1 is important in regulating T cell responses to influenza infection [7].', 'PDL1 is the ligand for the Programmed Cell Death (PD) receptor 1, which is a member of the CD28 family of T cell receptors with CD80 and CD86 being ligands for CD28.', 'In the standard model of T cell receptor (TCR) activation, activation of CD28 provides a necessary co-stimulation to prevent T cell anergy [8].', 'In contrast, binding of PDL1 to PD1 causes inhibition of TCR-mediated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3Kinase) activation leading to inhibition of T cell proliferation and cytokine release [9].', 'The increased expression and activation of the PD1/PDL1 axis in chronic viral infections such as HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) can lead to progressive loss of T cell function [#AUTHOR_TAG,11].', 'However, it was only recently that a role for this PD1/PDL1 pathway has been elucidated in the control of immune function in acute infections and increased PDL1 expression in response to pathogens was demonstrated to be crucial for impairment of CD8 cytotoxicity [7] and the development of regulatory T cells [12].', 'We have recently demonstrated that CD4 cytotoxic T cells play an important role in protecting against severe influenza infection.', 'This work demonstrated an additional role for MHC class II expressing cells and T helper cell responses [13] highlighting the potential importance of macrophage-T cell interactions in the control of influenza infection.']",0,"['The increased expression and activation of the PD1/PDL1 axis in chronic viral infections such as HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) can lead to progressive loss of T cell function [#AUTHOR_TAG,11].']"

CC2321,30780864,Viral infection of human lung macrophages increases pdl1 expression via ifn,Karl Staples,Pulmonary Defence Mechanisms,"[""LaurentP. Nicod""]","The airway epithelium forms a continuous barrier from the nose to the alveoli and serves a variety of functions. Multiple functionally distinct cell types are involved in these processes. The innate defence functions require a patent airway epithelium, with infections often associated with epithelial defects and phenotypic alterations that are themselves associated with multiple lung diseases. Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are frequently identified in the airways in a range of respiratory diseases These pathogens often trigger exacerbations and worsening symptoms that often result in hospitalisation. This is particularly true in paediatric populations. Although mortality for NTHi and RSV infections alone are themselves low it remains unclear what role these infections play in mortality rates in complex chronic respiratory infections. These studies aimed to establish NTHi and RSV infections within airway epithelium models, and use them as tools to study pulmonary innate defence mechanisms in order to understand the role of these infections in respiratory disease.     In vitro airway models were established using lung derived cell lines, undifferentiated primary human bronchial epithelial (uHBE) cells and air-liquid interface (ALI) differentiated uHBE cell cultures. Following establishment of differentiation we validated ALI cultures using a number of markers, including for the putative innate defence PLUNC family proteins, gel-forming mucins and tubulin. These markers are representative of different epithelial cell types within the cultures. Cultures were infected with NTHi or RSV for periods of time ranging from 1 hour to 7 days with a view to establishing chronic infections and allowing biofilm formation. Monolayer cultures showed an enhanced susceptibility to both infections. Cytokine array profiling showed enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in response to NTHi and RSV infections in ALI cells resulting in an ability to manage infections compared to monolayer cultures. Expression analysis indicated that both infections altered the transcription of a number of pro-inflammatory genes. Neutrophil products and trypsin were shown to degrade PLUNC proteins in ALI cell secretions. NTHi also appeared to cause degradation of PLUNC proteins suggesting that infection may impair the innate defence shield of the airway epithelium. Our data showed that differential ALI cultures of human airway cells are a useful model for the study of respiratory pathogens","Macrophages are not only a key line of defence in the respiratory tract, responsible for phagocytosis and clearance of infectious organisms but are also orchestrators of the adaptive immune response through presentation of antigen and by the cytokines they release [4,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['The optimal immune response to respiratory viral infections requires a coordinated and balanced response from an array of innate and adaptive responses.', 'Although the influenza virus primarily infects the respiratory epithelium, this virus can also infect and replicate in human alveolar macrophages [1][2][3].', 'Macrophages are not only a key line of defence in the respiratory tract, responsible for phagocytosis and clearance of infectious organisms but are also orchestrators of the adaptive immune response through presentation of antigen and by the cytokines they release [4,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'Direct infection of airway macrophages has been postulated as a key mechanism in the development of secondary bacterial infection of the airway leading to consequent pneumonia as described in 1918 influenza pandemic cases [3].', 'It has also been hypothesised that the mortality associated with novel strains of influenza (e.g.', 'H5N1), is due to increases in macrophage cytokine release [6] highlighting a key role in the control of the inflammatory response.']",0,"['Macrophages are not only a key line of defence in the respiratory tract, responsible for phagocytosis and clearance of infectious organisms but are also orchestrators of the adaptive immune response through presentation of antigen and by the cytokines they release [4,#AUTHOR_TAG].']"
CC2322,30780864,Viral infection of human lung macrophages increases pdl1 expression via ifn,Karl Staples,Macrophages and Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils in Lung Defense and Injury,"[""Yves Sibille"", ""Herbert Y. Reynolds""]","Phagocytes, in particular macrophages and PMN, are now recognized as major components of inflammatory and immunologic reactions in the lung. Normally, macrophages represent the majority of phagocytes in the lower respiratory tract. These lung macrophages are morphologically and functionally heterogenous and include alveolar, interstitial, intravascular, and airway macrophages, each with characteristic morphologic and functional features. Through the presence of surface receptors for numerous ligands and through their large number of secretory products, lung macrophages can respond to environmental factors and account for most of the clearance of microparticles and microorganisms in the distal airways and the alveolar spaces. In addition, macrophages also play an important role in inflammatory processes through the release of oxygen radicals and proteolytic enzymes. Through the release of several cytokines, i.e., growth-promoting and inhibiting factors, lung macrophages may also influence both matrix damage and repair processes. Macrophages can also contribute to the alveolitis by recruitment of inflammatory and immune cells. This latter contribution is best demonstrated in migration movement of PMN. The normal distal airways generally contain a small number of PMN, but the pulmonary vascular bed represents a large reservoir of PMN. Some of them are in intimate contact with the endothelium, forming the so-called marginating pool of PMN. Because the capillary lumen is separated only from the alveolar space by a monolayer of endothelial and epithelial cells on each side of a thin interstitial matrix, it is likely that some inhibitory mechanism exists to prevent PMN from migrating towards the alveolar space. Such inhibitors of PMN migration are present both in serum and in the alveolar space, some being released by alveolar macrophages. However, alveolar macrophages can also secrete factors called chemotaxins that attract PMN to the airways, and this supports a central role for alveolar macrophages in the regulation of PMN traffic in the lungs. Thus, secretory products of alveolar macrophages are part of the regulatory mechanisms of PMN mobility and adherence that appears to be crucial in the initiation of some inflammatory reactions. The contribution of phagocytes to the defense against infection and tumor has been documented mostly in vitro. Thus, both oxygen radicals, in particular hydroxyl radicals and proteases such as lysozyme, are potent bactericidal agents. That phagocytes are also important defenders of the lungs in vivo is best supported by the observations in immunodeficient patients and animal models.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Macrophages are not only a key line of defence in the respiratory tract, responsible for phagocytosis and clearance of infectious organisms but are also orchestrators of the adaptive immune response through presentation of antigen and by the cytokines they release [#AUTHOR_TAG,5].","['The optimal immune response to respiratory viral infections requires a coordinated and balanced response from an array of innate and adaptive responses.', 'Although the influenza virus primarily infects the respiratory epithelium, this virus can also infect and replicate in human alveolar macrophages [1][2][3].', 'Macrophages are not only a key line of defence in the respiratory tract, responsible for phagocytosis and clearance of infectious organisms but are also orchestrators of the adaptive immune response through presentation of antigen and by the cytokines they release [#AUTHOR_TAG,5].', 'Direct infection of airway macrophages has been postulated as a key mechanism in the development of secondary bacterial infection of the airway leading to consequent pneumonia as described in 1918 influenza pandemic cases [3].', 'It has also been hypothesised that the mortality associated with novel strains of influenza (e.g.', 'H5N1), is due to increases in macrophage cytokine release [6] highlighting a key role in the control of the inflammatory response.']",0,"['Macrophages are not only a key line of defence in the respiratory tract, responsible for phagocytosis and clearance of infectious organisms but are also orchestrators of the adaptive immune response through presentation of antigen and by the cytokines they release [#AUTHOR_TAG,5].']"

Forty talkers were recorded in pairs while engaged in ""spot the difference"" picture tasks in good and challenging conditions. In the challenging conditions, one talker heard the other (1) via a three-channel noise vocoder (VOC); (2) with simultaneous babble noise (BABBLE).

In the VOC condition, where F0 and intensity enhancements are unlikely to aid intelligibility, talkers did not change their F0 median and range; mean energy and vowel F1 increased less than in the BABBLE condition.

Two approaches to training were implemented. One training approach required subjects to recognize isolated words, while the other training approach required subjects to recognize words in sentences. Both approaches to training improved the ability to identify words in sentences. Improvements following a single session (lasting 1-2 h) of auditory training ranged between 7 and 12 %pts and were significantly larger than improvements following a visual control task that was matched with the auditory training task in terms of the response demands. An additional three sessions of word- and sentence-based training led to further improvements, with the average overall improvement ranging from 13 to 18% pts. When a tonotopic misalignment of 3 mm rather than 6 mm was simulated, training with several talkers led to greater generalization to new talkers than training with a single talker. The results confirm that computer-based lexical training can help overcome the effects of spectral distortions in speech, and they suggest that training materials are most effective when several talkers are included.","This method is based on techniques designed to share some of the features of CDT #AUTHOR_TAG and Summerfield, 2007).","['Here we have extended a method of computer-based training previously used with sentences to make it closely comparable to live-voice CDT, so allowing the importance of live-voice presentation to be assessed.', 'This method is based on techniques designed to share some of the features of CDT #AUTHOR_TAG and Summerfield, 2007).', 'We have followed closely the implementation of Stacey and Summerfield using a closed-set task in which sentences were replaced by pre-recorded phrases from the same connected narrative text and talker as used for live-voice CDT.', 'We therefore have two training methods that are identical in respect of the training talker and text and differ in the use of live compared to pre-recorded speech, in the use of an open response choice in CDT compared to a closed response set, and in the degree of interaction inherent to the methods.', 'A comparison of these two methods allows us to assess whether there are advantages from the more naturalistic approach of live-voice CDT.', 'The speech processing is similar to that used in two previous studies (Faulkner et al., 2006;Stacey and Summerfield, 2007) and simulates an eight-channel cochlear implant with upward frequency shifting representing the relatively shallow electrode insertions that are found in many CI recipients (Ketten et al., 1998).', 'The choice of eight channels reflects the effective number of channels seen in CI users who perform relatively well in noise (Friesen et al., 2001).']",5,"['Here we have extended a method of computer-based training previously used with sentences to make it closely comparable to live-voice CDT, so allowing the importance of live-voice presentation to be assessed.', 'This method is based on techniques designed to share some of the features of CDT #AUTHOR_TAG and Summerfield, 2007).', 'We have followed closely the implementation of Stacey and Summerfield using a closed-set task in which sentences were replaced by pre-recorded phrases from the same connected narrative text and talker as used for live-voice CDT.', 'We therefore have two training methods that are identical in respect of the training talker and text and differ in the use of live compared to pre-recorded speech, in the use of an open response choice in CDT compared to a closed response set, and in the degree of interaction inherent to the methods.', 'A comparison of these two methods allows us to assess whether there are advantages from the more naturalistic approach of live-voice CDT.', 'The speech processing is similar to that used in two previous studies (Faulkner et al., 2006;Stacey and Summerfield, 2007) and simulates an eight-channel cochlear implant with upward frequency shifting representing the relatively shallow electrode insertions that are found in many CI recipients (Ketten et al., 1998).', 'The choice of eight channels reflects the effective number of channels seen in CI users who perform relatively well in noise (Friesen et al., 2001).']"

However, a distortion of frequency-to-place mapping may also arise due to a region of dysfunctional neurons that creates a ""hole"" in the tonotopic representation. This study simulated a 10 mm hole in the mid-frequency region. Noise-band processors were created with six output bands (three apical and three basal to the hole). The spectral information that would have been represented in the hole was either dropped or reassigned to bands on either side. Such reassignment preserves information but warps the place code, which may in itself impair performance. Normally hearing subjects received three hours of training in two reassignment conditions. Speech recognition improved considerably with training. Scores were much lower in a baseline (untrained) condition where information from the hole region was dropped. A second group of subjects trained in this dropped condition did show some improvement; however, scores after training were significantly lower than in the reassignment conditions. These results are consistent with the view that speech processors should present the most informative frequency range irrespective of frequency misalignment.","Connected discourse tracking (CDT: DeFilippo and Scott, 1978) has been reported as effective in training normal hearing listeners to adapt over several hours to speech that is vocoded and spectrally shifted (Faulkner et al., 2006;Rosen et al., 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG and Faulkner, 2006).","['Connected discourse tracking (CDT: DeFilippo and Scott, 1978) has been reported as effective in training normal hearing listeners to adapt over several hours to speech that is vocoded and spectrally shifted (Faulkner et al., 2006;Rosen et al., 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG and Faulkner, 2006).', 'The learning shown in these studies was more than expected simply from repetition of test materials, but in the absence of control groups, the effectiveness of CDT was not absolutely established.', 'CDT uses live voice and a dyadic interaction that mimics many features of natural communication.', 'The trainer reads phrases from a connected text that the trainee attempts to repeat back.', 'If the repetition is accurate, the trainer proceeds to the next phrase.', 'If part of the response is in error, the trainer repeats the phrase, and another response is elicited.', 'CDT encourages the use of naturalistic idioms and allows the training talker to adapt their speaking style to perceptual difficulties (Hazan and Baker, 2011).', 'However, the use of livevoice makes CDT labor-intensive, and in both research and clinical contexts, automated training has many attractions.', 'In clinical contexts, where the object is to improve communication, automated training also has cost advantages.', 'In research, the use of unrepeatable live-voice compromises comparisons across conditions.']",4,"['Connected discourse tracking (CDT: DeFilippo and Scott, 1978) has been reported as effective in training normal hearing listeners to adapt over several hours to speech that is vocoded and spectrally shifted (Faulkner et al., 2006;Rosen et al., 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG and Faulkner, 2006).', 'The learning shown in these studies was more than expected simply from repetition of test materials, but in the absence of control groups, the effectiveness of CDT was not absolutely established.']"

Greenwood""]","Accurate cochlear frequency-position functions based on physiological data would facilitate the interpretation of physiological and psychoacoustic data within and across species. Such functions might aid in developing cochlear models, and cochlear coordinates could provide potentially useful spectral transforms of speech and other acoustic signals. In 1961, an almost-exponential function was developed (Greenwood, 1961b, 1974) by integrating an exponential function fitted to a subset of frequency resolution-integration estimates (critical bandwidths). The resulting frequency-position function was found to fit cochlear observations on human cadaver ears quite well and, with changes of constants, those on elephant, cow, guinea pig, rat, mouse, and chicken (BŽkŽsy, 1960), as well as in vivo (behavioral-anatomical) data on cats (Schucknecht, 1953). Since 1961, new mechanical and other physiological data have appeared on the human, cat, guinea pig, chinchilla, monkey, and gerbil. It is shown here that the newer extended data on human cadaver ears and from living animal preparations are quite well fit by the same basic function. The function essentially requires only empirical adjustment of a single parameter to set an upper frequency limit, while a ""slope"" parameter can be left constant if cochlear partition length is normalized to 1 or scaled if distance is specified in physical units. Constancy of slope and form in dead and living ears and across species increases the probability that the function fitting human cadaver data may apply as well to the living human ear. This prospect increases the function's value in plotting auditory data and in modeling concerned with speech and other bioacoustic signals, since it fits the available physiological data well and, consequently (if those data are correct), remains independent of, and an appropriate means to examine, psychoacoustic data and assumptions.",The eight analysis filters spanned 100-4500 Hz and were spaced at equal basilar membrane distances according to #AUTHOR_TAG's (1990) cochlear position map.,"['Real-time noise-excited vocoder processing was implemented using the ALADDIN WORK-BENCH software (Hitech AB) and two Loughborough Sound Images TMS320C30 DSP cards.', ""The eight analysis filters spanned 100-4500 Hz and were spaced at equal basilar membrane distances according to #AUTHOR_TAG's (1990) cochlear position map."", 'These filters were elliptic designs with three orders per side and cut-off frequencies as shown in Table 1.', 'An envelope was extracted from each analysis band using half-wave rectification and a 160 Hz low-pass filter (fourth order elliptic).', 'Each band envelope was then multiplied against an independent white noise.', 'The resulting modulated noises were passed through eight output filters and finally summed together.', 'In the unshifted vocoder, the output filters matched the analysis filters.', ""In the shifted vocoder, the output filters (see Table 1) had cut-off frequencies shifted upwards from the analysis filters by 6 mm on the basilar membrane according to Greenwood's map."", 'Processed stimuli were presented to both ears at a level of approximately 70 dB SPL through Sennheiser HD540 headphones.']",5,"[""The eight analysis filters spanned 100-4500 Hz and were spaced at equal basilar membrane distances according to #AUTHOR_TAG's (1990) cochlear position map.""]"

For noise-vocoded sentences, a manipulation that removes spectral detail from speech, listeners' reporting improved from near 0% to 70% correct over 30 sentences (Experiment 1). Learning was enhanced if listeners heard distorted sentences while they knew the identity of the undistorted target (Experiments 2 and 3). Learning was absent when listeners were trained with nonword sentences (Experiments 4 and 5), although the meaning of the training sentences did not affect learning (Experiment 5).

Shannon"", ""Fan-Gang Zeng"", ""John Wygonski""]","Recognition of consonants, vowels, and sentences was measured in conditions of reduced spectral resolution and distorted spectral distribution of temporal envelope cues. Speech materials were processed through four bandpass filters (analysis bands), half-wave rectified, and low-pass filtered to extract the temporal envelope from each band. The envelope from each speech band modulated a band-limited noise (carrier bands). Analysis and carrier bands were manipulated independently to alter the spectral distribution of envelope cues. Experiment I demonstrated that the location of the cutoff frequencies defining the bands was not a critical parameter for speech recognition, as long as the analysis and carrier bands were matched in frequency extent. Experiment II demonstrated a dramatic decrease in performance when the analysis and carrier bands did not match in frequency extent, which resulted in a warping of the spectral distribution of envelope cues. Experiment III demonstrated a large decrease in performance when the carrier bands were shifted in frequency, mimicking the basal position of electrodes in a cochlear implant. And experiment IV showed a relatively minor effect of the overlap in the noise carrier bands, simulating the overlap in neural populations responding to adjacent electrodes in a cochlear implant. Overall, these results show that, for four bands, the frequency alignment of the analysis bands and carrier bands is critical for good performance, while the exact frequency divisions and overlap in carrier bands are not as critical.","When vocoded speech is spectrally shifted upward to simulate relatively shallow CI electrode insertions, shifts in excess of 3 mm of basilar membrane distance have large acute effects on speech perception (Dorman et al., 1997;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1998).","['The ability of human listeners to adapt to distortions of speech is of interest both in relation to the effectiveness of auditory prostheses and in more basic investigations of speech perception.', 'This ability also raises the question of how such adaptation can be facilitated through training.', 'Much work has centered on noise or tone-vocoding, which has become popular as a technique for manipulating the level of spectral detail, and because of its similarity to the processing in cochlear implants.', 'Listeners can adapt rapidly to low spectral resolution vocoded speech (e.g., Davis et al., 2005).', 'However, a combination of vocoding with spectral shifting can be more challenging.', 'When vocoded speech is spectrally shifted upward to simulate relatively shallow CI electrode insertions, shifts in excess of 3 mm of basilar membrane distance have large acute effects on speech perception (Dorman et al., 1997;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1998).', 'These effects can be markedly reduced with training, but this requires several hours, substantially longer than for vocoding alone (Faulkner et al., 2006;Fu and Galvin, 2003;Nogaki et al., 2007;Rosen et al., 1999).', 'Cochlear implant listeners show comparable adaptation to changes of frequency mapping (Dorman and Ketten, 2003;Fu et al., 2002), and several studies indicate that explicit speech-based training can facilitate this Fu and Galvin, 2008).']",0,"['The ability of human listeners to adapt to distortions of speech is of interest both in relation to the effectiveness of auditory prostheses and in more basic investigations of speech perception.', 'When vocoded speech is spectrally shifted upward to simulate relatively shallow CI electrode insertions, shifts in excess of 3 mm of basilar membrane distance have large acute effects on speech perception (Dorman et al., 1997;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1998).']"

Galvin""]","Previous studies have shown that the protocol used for auditory training may significantly affect the outcome of training. However, it is unclear how often training should be performed to maximize its benefit. The present study investigated how the frequency of training contributed to normal-hearing listeners' adaptation to spectrally shifted speech.Eighteen normal-hearing listeners were trained with spectrally shifted and compressed speech via an 8-channel acoustic simulation of cochlear implant speech processing. Five short training sessions (1 hr per session) were completed by each subject; subjects were trained at one of three training rates: five sessions per week, three sessions per week, or one session per week. Subjects were trained to identify medial vowels presented in a cVc format; depending on the level of difficulty, the number of response choices was increased and/or the acoustic differences between vowels were reduced. Vowel and consonant recognition was measured before and after training as well as at regular intervals during the training period. Sentence recognition was measured before and after training only.Results showed that pretraining vowel recognition scores were poor (14.0% correct, on average) for all subjects, due to the severe spectral shift. After five sessions of targeted vowel contrast training, there was a significant improvement of shifted vowel recognition for most subjects. The mean improvement was comparable (approximately 15 percentage points) across the three training rate conditions, despite significant intersubject variability in pre- and pretraining baseline performance. There was no significant difference in training outcomes among the three training rates. Spectrally shifted consonant and sentence recognition also improved by approximately 20 percentage points after training, even though consonants and sentences were not explicitly trained. Similar to vowel recognition, there was no significant difference in training outcomes among the three training rates for shifted consonant and sentence recognition.The results demonstrated that the training rate had little effect on normal-hearing listeners' adaptation to spectrally shifted speech, at least for the training periods (ranging from 1 to 5 wk) used in the present study. The outcome of auditory training may depend more strongly on the amount of training (i.e., total number of training sessions) rather than the frequency of training (i.e., daily or once per week). Although more frequent training may accelerate listeners' adaptation to spectrally shifted speech, there may be significant benefits from training as little as one session per week. The results of the present study suggest that appropriate training schedules can be developed to optimize the effectiveness, efficiency, and effort associated with hearing-impaired patients' auditory rehabilitation.","These effects can be markedly reduced with training, but this requires several hours, substantially longer than for vocoding alone (Faulkner et al., 2006;Fu and Galvin, 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007;Rosen et al., 1999).","['The ability of human listeners to adapt to distortions of speech is of interest both in relation to the effectiveness of auditory prostheses and in more basic investigations of speech perception.', 'This ability also raises the question of how such adaptation can be facilitated through training.', 'Much work has centered on noise or tone-vocoding, which has become popular as a technique for manipulating the level of spectral detail, and because of its similarity to the processing in cochlear implants.', 'Listeners can adapt rapidly to low spectral resolution vocoded speech (e.g., Davis et al., 2005).', 'However, a combination of vocoding with spectral shifting can be more challenging.', 'When vocoded speech is spectrally shifted upward to simulate relatively shallow CI electrode insertions, shifts in excess of 3 mm of basilar membrane distance have large acute effects on speech perception (Dorman et al., 1997;Shannon et al., 1998).', 'These effects can be markedly reduced with training, but this requires several hours, substantially longer than for vocoding alone (Faulkner et al., 2006;Fu and Galvin, 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007;Rosen et al., 1999).', 'Cochlear implant listeners show comparable adaptation to changes of frequency mapping (Dorman and Ketten, 2003;Fu et al., 2002), and several studies indicate that explicit speech-based training can facilitate this Fu and Galvin, 2008).']",0,"['These effects can be markedly reduced with training, but this requires several hours, substantially longer than for vocoding alone (Faulkner et al., 2006;Fu and Galvin, 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007;Rosen et al., 1999).']"

Using noise-band vocoder processing, acoustic information was spectrally distorted by shifting speech information from one frequency region to another. Six subjects were tested with spectrally shifted sentences after five days of practice with upwardly shifted training sentences. Training with upwardly shifted sentences significantly improved recognition of upwardly shifted speech; recognition of downwardly shifted speech was nearly unchanged. Three subjects were later trained with downwardly shifted speech. Results showed that the mean improvement was comparable to that observed with the upwardly shifted training. In this retrain and retest condition, performance was largely unchanged for upwardly shifted sentence recognition, suggesting that these listeners had retained some of the improved speech perception resulting from the previous training. The results suggest that listeners are able to partially adapt to a spectral shift in acoustic speech patterns over the short-term, given sufficient training. However, the improvement was localized to where the spectral shift was trained, as no change in performance was observed for spectrally altered speech outside of the trained regions.","These effects can be markedly reduced with training, but this requires several hours, substantially longer than for vocoding alone (Faulkner et al., 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG and Galvin, 2003;Nogaki et al., 2007;Rosen et al., 1999).","['The ability of human listeners to adapt to distortions of speech is of interest both in relation to the effectiveness of auditory prostheses and in more basic investigations of speech perception.', 'This ability also raises the question of how such adaptation can be facilitated through training.', 'Much work has centered on noise or tone-vocoding, which has become popular as a technique for manipulating the level of spectral detail, and because of its similarity to the processing in cochlear implants.', 'Listeners can adapt rapidly to low spectral resolution vocoded speech (e.g., Davis et al., 2005).', 'However, a combination of vocoding with spectral shifting can be more challenging.', 'When vocoded speech is spectrally shifted upward to simulate relatively shallow CI electrode insertions, shifts in excess of 3 mm of basilar membrane distance have large acute effects on speech perception (Dorman et al., 1997;Shannon et al., 1998).', 'These effects can be markedly reduced with training, but this requires several hours, substantially longer than for vocoding alone (Faulkner et al., 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG and Galvin, 2003;Nogaki et al., 2007;Rosen et al., 1999).', 'Cochlear implant listeners show comparable adaptation to changes of frequency mapping (Dorman and Ketten, 2003;Fu et al., 2002), and several studies indicate that explicit speech-based training can facilitate this Fu and Galvin, 2008).']",0,"['These effects can be markedly reduced with training, but this requires several hours, substantially longer than for vocoding alone (Faulkner et al., 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG and Galvin, 2003;Nogaki et al., 2007;Rosen et al., 1999).']"

They were assigned randomly to word-, sentence-, or phoneme-based training and underwent 9 training sessions (20 min each) on separate days over a 2- to 3-week period. The effectiveness of training was assessed as the improvement in accuracy of discriminating vowels and consonants, as well as identifying words in sentences, relative to participants' best performance in repeated tests prior to training.Word- and sentence-based training led to significant improvements in the ability to identify words in sentences that were significantly larger than the improvements produced by phoneme-based training.

Insertion depth was simulated by outputting sine waves from each channel of the processor at a frequency determined by the cochlear place of electrodes inserted 22-25 mm into the cochlea. The results indicate that simulated insertion depth had a significant effect on performance. Performance at 22- and 23-mm simulated insertion depths was always poorer than normal, and performance at 25 mm simulated insertion depth was, most generally, the same as normal.

The test materials consist of 10 lists of 15 short sentences of homogeneous intelligibility when presented acoustically, and of different, but still homogeneous, intelligibility when presented audio-visually, in white noise. Homogeneity was achieved by applying phonetic and linguistic principles at the stage of compilation, followed by pilot testing and balancing of properties. To run the test, lists are presented at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) determined by an up-down psychophysical rule so as to estimate auditory and audio-visual speech-reception thresholds, defined as the SNRs at which the three content words in each sentence are identified correctly on 50% of trials. These thresholds provide measures of a subject's speech-reception abilities. The difference between them provides a measure of the benefit received from vision. It is shown that this measure is closely related to the accuracy with which subjects lip-read words in sentences with no acoustical information.

The analyses showed that daughters of non-employed, lone-mothers were less likely to have attained qualifications, to be more economically disadvantaged and more likely to have become young mothers than their contemporaries in the reference group of intact families with a working mother. However, young women from lone-mother families in which the mother was in employement had similar experiences to those from intact dual earner families. Amongst the men, having a working, lone-mother reflected positively in the economic domain.

Special efforts are made to disentangle the effects of family size and birth order, since these effects have often been confounded in the past. Children from larger families are found to do worse than children from smaller families, and children lower down the birth order do worse than those higher up the birth order. These findings are consistent with theoretical predictions, but the finding that only children perform worse than those from two-child families, even controlling for a whole range of parental and school characteristics, is not. This paper suggests that as well as inputs from parents, interactions with other children may be important in children's educational development: this idea is supported by the finding that mixing with other children outside school reduces the disadvantage otherwise associated with being an only child. Additionally, the important finding emerges that only children are at much more of a disadvantage on mathematically-based measures of performance than on language-based measures, suggesting that these skills may be acquired via different processes.

This article demonstrates that such measurement is theoretically and empirically untenable. Models that incorporate both mothers' and fathers' characteristics into class origin measures fit observed mobility patterns better than do conventional models, and for both men and women. Furthermore, in contrast to the current consensus that conventional measurement strategies do not alter substantive research conclusions, analyses of cohort change in social mobility illustrate the distortions that conventional practice can produce in stratification research findings. By failing to measure the impact of mothers' class, the current practice misses a recent upturn in the importance of family background for class outcomes among men in the United States.

Odds ratios with 95 percent confidence intervals are reported for those living in lone-parent households and reconstituted households each compared with intact families. Similar results are reported for those living in families disrupted by the death of a parent and for those whose parents had separated. No statistically significant differences (at the 5 percent level) were found between the two studies in the adjusted models.

This sample allows us to estimate the relationship of interest by using sibling differences.

The estimates based on sibling differences require weaker assumptions (compared with the assumptions that are imposed by nonparametric estimators under conditional independence and level estimators) for the identification of the effects of family structure and parental joblessness on the outcomes under analysis. We find that experiences of life in a single-parent family and with jobless parents during childhood are usually associated with disadvantageous outcomes for young adults, the effect of family structure is in general significantly greater (in absolute value) than the effect of parental worklessness and most of the unfavourable outcomes are linked to an early family disruption, when the child was aged 0-5 years, whereas the timing of parental joblessness during childhood has more complex effects, with different outcomes being more strongly influenced by parental worklessness at different ages of the child.

But if more than one member of a family is assigned a class position independently of the other members, the two basic factors of class position, according to Lockwood, work situation and market situation, do not necessarily coincide, since the work situation relates uniquely to the individual, while the market situation refers to the family or household. It is suggested that work position, based on the occupations of individuals, should be used as an indicator of the work situation, and that class position, based on information about the occupations of those family members who carry the economic responsibility of the household, should be used as the indicator of the market situation. A way for ascribing a class position to families, and thereby to family members, is developed. It utilizes the work positions of both spouses and is based on an order of dominance, where occupations high in this order are presumed to influence the market situation of the family more than occupations of lower levels. Class positions of single individuals or families are thought to be rather stable over time.

However, because sibship size is likely to be endogenous to children's schooling in the sense that parents who have many children also have other socio-economic characteristics that lead to low educational attainment, it is difficult to determine if sibship size actually has a negative effect on educational attainment or whether the effect is spurious. This article deals with the endogeneity problem by using mothers' and fathers' inherited reproductive capacity as a `natural' experiment which affects sibship size but which, arguably, has no direct effect on children's educational attainment. I analyse data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study and use information on mothers' and fathers' sibship sizes and age at birth of first child as instruments for sibship size. After correcting for endogeneity, I find that sibship size has a negative causal effect on educational attainment.","This may be stronger for boys and in lone-mother families, although the evidence is mixed (see Downey, 1995;Dronkers, 1994;Gayle et al., 2002;Iacovou, 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2008).","['Another family structure feature which US studies have consistently shown affects attainment is number of siblings (Downey, 1995).', 'While often included as a control, this is rarely a focus of UK studies, Iacovou (2001) excepted.', 'Her findings echo Van Eijck and De Graaf (1995: 282), who suggest that only children constitute the sole exception to a generally negative effect of increasing family size in western societies.', 'This may be stronger for boys and in lone-mother families, although the evidence is mixed (see Downey, 1995;Dronkers, 1994;Gayle et al., 2002;Iacovou, 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2008).', 'Iacovou (2001) shows much of the sibling effect reflects parental characteristics and behaviour (see also Downey, 1995;Jaeger, 2008).', ""Theoretical discussions often foreground 'Resource Dilution Theory', which suggests that number of siblings impacts on receipt of various parental resources, confirmed for the USA by Downey (1995); in Britain, Lawson and Mace (2009) found negative effects of higher family size on parental investment."", ""Number of siblings is crucial for analyses of family-type effects; if lone-mother families contain fewer children, this 'advantage' will weaken any negative lone-mother family effects in studies not controlling for siblings (Biblarz and Raftery, 1999: 328).""]",0,"['Another family structure feature which US studies have consistently shown affects attainment is number of siblings (Downey, 1995).', 'This may be stronger for boys and in lone-mother families, although the evidence is mixed (see Downey, 1995;Dronkers, 1994;Gayle et al., 2002;Iacovou, 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2008).', 'Iacovou (2001) shows much of the sibling effect reflects parental characteristics and behaviour (see also Downey, 1995;Jaeger, 2008).', ""Theoretical discussions often foreground 'Resource Dilution Theory', which suggests that number of siblings impacts on receipt of various parental resources, confirmed for the USA by Downey (1995); in Britain, Lawson and Mace (2009) found negative effects of higher family size on parental investment."", ""Number of siblings is crucial for analyses of family-type effects; if lone-mother families contain fewer children, this 'advantage' will weaken any negative lone-mother family effects in studies not controlling for siblings (Biblarz and Raftery, 1999: 328).""]"

In the case of men, there is also little change in rates of upward and downward mobility -- in contrast with the middle decades of the twentieth century when upward mobility steadily increased while downward mobility fell. This latter pattern does, however, prevail in the case of women. As regards relative rates, we again find, for men and women alike, an essential constancy over time. This, then, indicates that such changes as are apparent in absolute rates derive from shifts in class distributions rather than from any significant increase or decrease in social fluidity. Our results are contrary to the prevailing view in political and media circles that in Britain today the level of social mobility is in decline, although for men the pattern of mobility has become less favourable.

This study constructs an approach to spate irrigation as a landscape technology by selectively fusing concepts of resilience ecology, political ecology, and actor-network theory. It is applied to a case study of the Calicanto area (Cochabamba, Bolivia) with emphasis on the 1990-1993 period. Calicanto spate irrigation provided an effective landscape technology over more than 15 km 2 and 3500 fields via a 65-km canal network, thus comprising the largest spate-irrigated area of Latin America. Use of this irrigation technology was linked to climate variability and environmental variation as well as landscape features, livelihood diversification including widespread migration, and innovative high-agrobiodiversity land use, in addition to community resource management, settlement patterning, population density, and production intensity. Notwithstanding social-ecological resilience and versatility, the trajectory of this irrigation underwent major change with new waterworks launched in 1993. Key lessons for the related social-ecological sciences, development policy, and sustainability perspectives include: (i) versatility and viability of spate irrigation hinges on multiple social-ecological links; and (ii) its limitations include eclipse via irrigation trajectories lacking social-ecological analytic and conceptual capacities, and widespread albeit largely unacknowledged biases against the landscape technology of spate irrigation.","We understand this type of human knowledge as a subject of continuous iteration be-tween individual and collective perceptions, practices

In this area, glaciers have a crucial impact on runoff which is of essential importance for the highly populated and cultivated valley of the Callejon de Huaylas particularly during the dry season. Whereas the mid latitudes glacier runoff amplifies the seasonal variation of runoff, the effect of glaciers in the low latitudes is a smoothing one. It decreases clearly with the decreasing degree of glaciation. In addition, particular circumstances of this tropical environment allow the reconstruction of a glacier mass balance history from the hydrological data for the second half of the 20th century. It shows a high synchronicity with the global trend of periods with glacier mass loss and gain. Comparison with length variations of three individual glaciers indicate a rather fast reaction of these glaciers to changes in mass balance. Although the mass balance variations show some differences among the individual catchment basins, the over all trend is uniform.

Mark"", ""Adam French"", ""Jeffrey Bury"", ""Kenneth R. Young"", ""Jeffrey M.

To understand, model, and adapt to these climate-glacier-water changes, it is vital to integrate the analysis of both water availability (the domain of hydrologists) and water use (the focus for social scientists). Drawn from a case study of the Santa River watershed below Peru's glaciated Cordillera Blanca mountain range, this paper provides a holistic hydro-social framework that identifies five major human variables critical to hydrological modeling because these forces have profoundly influenced water use over the last 60 years: (1) political agendas and economic development; (2) governance: laws and institutions; (3) technology and engineering; (4) land and resource use; and (5) societal responses. Notable shifts in Santa River water use--including major expansions in hydroelectricity generation, large-scale irrigation projects, and other land and resource-use practices--did not necessarily stem from changing glacier runoff or hydrologic shifts, but rather from these human variables. Ultimately, then, water usage is not predictable based on water availability alone. Glacier runoff conforms to certain expected trends predicted by models of progressively reduced glacier storage. However, societal forces establish the legal, economic, political, cultural, and social drivers that actually shape water usage patterns via human modification of watershed dynamics. This hydro-social framework has widespread implications for hydrological modeling in glaciated watersheds from the Andes and Alps to the Himalaya and Tien Shan, as well as for the development of climate change adaptation plans.","Glacier contribution definitely has a considerable effect on the runoff of the R�_o Santa during the dry season (Bury et al., 2013;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014) and even more so on the tributaries draining the Cordillera Blanca.","['Glacier contribution definitely has a considerable effect on the runoff of the R�_o Santa during the dry season (Bury et al., 2013;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014) and even more so on the tributaries draining the Cordillera Blanca.', 'Both ancient and modern channel systems have witnessed the sophisticated use of Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.']",0,"['Glacier contribution definitely has a considerable effect on the runoff of the R�_o Santa during the dry season (Bury et al., 2013;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014) and even more so on the tributaries draining the Cordillera Blanca.']"

The aim of this paper is to assess local air temperature and precipitation changes in the Cordillera Blanca and to discuss how these variables could have affected the observed glacier retreat between the 1980s and present. A unique data set from a large number of stations in the region of the Cordillera Blanca shows that after a strong air temperature rise of about 0.31 degC per decade between 1969 and 1998, a slowdown in the warming to about 0.13 degC per decade occurred for the 30 years from 1983 to 2012. Additionally, based on data from a long-term meteorological station, it was found that the freezing line altitude during precipitation days has probably not increased significantly in the last 30 years. We documented a cooling trend for maximum daily air temperatures and an increase in precipitation of about 60 mm/decade since the early 1980s. The strong increase in precipitation in the last 30 years probably did not balance the increase of temperature before the 1980s. It is suggested that recent changes in temperature and precipitation alone may not explain the glacial recession within the thirty years from the early 1980s to 2012.

Mark"", ""Raymond S. Bradley""]","Observations on glacier extent from Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia give a detailed and unequivocal account of rapid shrinkage of tropical Andean glaciers since the Little Ice Age (LIA). This retreat however, was not continuous but interrupted by several periods of stagnant or even advancing glaciers, most recently around the end of the 20th century. New data from mass balance networks established on over a dozen glaciers allows comparison of the glacier behavior in the inner and outer tropics. It appears that glacier variations are quite coherent throughout the region, despite different sensitivities to climatic forcing such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, etc. In parallel with the glacier retreat, climate in the tropical Andes has changed significantly over the past 50-60 years. Temperature in the Andes has increased by approximately 0.1 degrees C/decade, with only two of the last 20 years being below the 1961-90 average. Precipitation has slightly increased in the second half of the 20th century in the inner tropics and decreased in the outer tropics. The general pattern of moistening in the inner tropics and drying in the subtropical Andes is dynamically consistent with observed changes in the large-scale circulation, suggesting a strengthening of the tropical atmospheric circulation. Model projections of future climate change in the tropical Andes indicate a continued warming of the tropical troposphere throughout the 21st century, with a temperature increase that is enhanced at higher elevations. By the end of the 21st century, following the SIZES A2 emission scenario. the tropical Andes may experience a massive warming on the order of 4.5-5 degrees C. Predicted changes in precipitation include an increase in precipitation during the wet season and a decrease during the dry season, which would effectively enhance the seasonal hydrological cycle in the tropical Andes. These observed and predicted changes in climate affect the tropical glacier energy balance through its sensitivity to changes in atmospheric humidity (which governs sublimation), precipitation (whose variability induces a positive feedback on albedo) and cloudiness (which controls the incoming long-wave radiation). In the inner tropics air temperature also significantly influences the energy balance, albeit not through the sensible heat flux, but indirectly through fluctuations in the rain-snow line and hence changes in albedo and net radiation receipts. Given the projected changes in climate, based on different IPCC scenarios for 2050 and 2080, simulations with a tropical glacier-climate model indicate that glaciers will continue to retreat. Many smaller, low-lying glaciers are already completely out of equilibrium with current climate and will disappear within a few decades. But even in catchments where glaciers do not completely disappear, the change in streamflow seasonality, due to the reduction of the glacial buffer during the dry season, will significantly affect the water availability downstream. In the short-term, as glaciers retreat and lose mass, they add to a temporary increase in runoff to which downstream users will quickly adapt, thereby raising serious sustainability concerns","The increasing knowledge of human-caused climate warming and resulting impacts has attracted much attention in the region up to now (Baraer et al., 2012;Bury et al., 2013;Carey, 2010;Carey et al., 2014;Chevallier et al., 2011;Juen et al., 2007;Mark et al., 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008) and, among other interests, our interdisciplinary research team also focuses on this issue.","[""W.

In this study we examine how Water User Associations in the Eastern Andes of Colombia perceive water scarcity and the relationship between this perception and observed climate, land use, and demographic changes. Results demonstrate a complex relationship between perceptions and observed changes. On the one hand, observed changes in land cover match perceptions of deforestation as the primary cause of increasing water scarcity. On the other hand, perceptions of climate driven changes in water availability are not reflected in observed precipitation data. Furthermore, water scarcity was perceived in regions where seasonal rainfall variability is higher but not in regions where annual rainfall is lower. We discuss how these results contribute to our understanding of adaptation to climate change and the implications of possible mismatches between environmental changes and local perceptions.","Overall, and despite no detectable trends in the total amount of precipitation during the wet seasons (Fig. 4b) nor any other trend, the high inter-annual variability of (1) the timing of the onset of the agricultural year (as determined by the first pronounced precipitation event) and (2) dry spells during the wet season, especially during the very sensible early phase of plant growing, kept rain-fed farming constantly challenging and likely favored perceptions of water scarcity (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013).","['Overall, and despite no detectable trends in the total amount of precipitation during the wet seasons (Fig. 4b) nor any other trend, the high inter-annual variability of (1) the timing of the onset of the agricultural year (as determined by the first pronounced precipitation event) and (2) dry spells during the wet season, especially during the very sensible early phase of plant growing, kept rain-fed farming constantly challenging and likely favored perceptions of water scarcity (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013).']",1,"['Overall, and despite no detectable trends in the total amount of precipitation during the wet seasons (Fig. 4b) nor any other trend, the high inter-annual variability of (1) the timing of the onset of the agricultural year (as determined by the first pronounced precipitation event) and (2) dry spells during the wet season, especially during the very sensible early phase of plant growing, kept rain-fed farming constantly challenging and likely favored perceptions of water scarcity (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013).']"

In this study, a three-stage conceptual model for the onset of the South American monsoon season is proposed based on a rain threshold analysis and a rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) analysis of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project version 2 (GPCP-v2) dataset. This two-pronged approach allowed the identification of regions of South America that share a common seasonal cycle of rainfall variability and likely have a common mechanism for monsoon onset.        According to this model, the first stage of onset starts around pentad 59 (October 18-22) when precipitation begins in the northwestern part of the continent and gradually progresses towards the south and southeast. The second stage is marked by the abrupt establishment of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). This stage occurs on average around pentad 61 (October 28-November 1). The third stage of monsoon onset involves the late arrival of the monsoon to the mouth of the Amazon River, associated with the slow migration of the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This final stage of onset occurs on average by pentad 73 (December 27-31). This three-stage model of onset provides a useful framework for the study of regional differences in monsoon onset mechanisms, a subject that is further explored in two companion studies.

Kaser"", ""M. Grosshauser"", ""B. Marzeion""]","Abstract Knowledge of climate change and its impacts can facilitate adaptation efforts. However, complex system dynamics, data scarcity, and heterogeneity often generate both contradictory findings and unexpected climate change impacts. Here we present local ecological knowledge of climate and ecological change in central Tibet to support the finding of delayed summer on the Tibetan Plateau, a finding that has been subject to vigorous, ongoing debate based on Western scientific data. Tibetans who actively herd on a daily basis and are located at higher elevations were most likely to notice changes in seasonality, reported as later start of summer and green-up, and as delayed and shortened livestock milking season. Local meteorological data, indigenous observations of higher snowlines and long-term animal number data suggest that a regional warming trend, rather than land use change, may underlie the delayed phenology trends. We demonstrate that local ecological knowledge can reveal counter-intuitive outcomes and help resolve apparent contradictions through its strengths in situations of high variability, ability to integrate over a range of variables and time scales, and operation outside of Western scientific logic. This suggests local knowledge does not exist to be confirmed or disproved by Western science, but rather can also advance Western science and help contribute to its debates. It is precisely points of apparent contradiction within and between knowledge systems that are most productive for more extensive inquiry. Future research on climate change, and climate adaptation policy-making, will benefit from careful, contextual dialog with local observations, focusing on observable biophysical phenomena that are affected by temperature and precipitation and that are important to livelihoods.","It also takes account of potential complications caused by the different approaches of scientific groups in an interdisciplinary setting and by bringing together epistemologies represented by Western scientific knowledge with peasants' local knowledge (e.g., Boelens, 2014;Escobar, 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014;Lennox and Gowdy, 2014).","['The outcome of this study may shed light on other peasant communities in the region whose economy is based on rain-fed agriculture and, more generally, on mountain regions with similarly vulnerable communities and with similarly poor availability of information.', ""It also takes account of potential complications caused by the different approaches of scientific groups in an interdisciplinary setting and by bringing together epistemologies represented by Western scientific knowledge with peasants' local knowledge (e.g., Boelens, 2014;Escobar, 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014;Lennox and Gowdy, 2014)."", 'We emphasize that this study only concentrates on one variable (precipitation) out of a series of potentially interrelated variables explaining perceived changes.', 'It will, therefore, rather point out open questions then provide conclusive answers to the complex problem.', 'In fact we consider the outcome of our methodical experiments at the interface of the, by their nature, explicitly different knowledge systems as a major result.', 'We therefore provide the details of the approaches taken from both sides for providing insight to readers from different scientific disciplines.']",0,"['The outcome of this study may shed light on other peasant communities in the region whose economy is based on rain-fed agriculture and, more generally, on mountain regions with similarly vulnerable communities and with similarly poor availability of information.', ""It also takes account of potential complications caused by the different approaches of scientific groups in an interdisciplinary setting and by bringing together epistemologies represented by Western scientific knowledge with peasants' local knowledge (e.g., Boelens, 2014;Escobar, 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014;Lennox and Gowdy, 2014)."", 'We emphasize that this study only concentrates on one variable (precipitation) out of a series of potentially interrelated variables explaining perceived changes.']"

The most dynamic LULCCs between 1990 and 2000 were large increases in wetlands and a loss of permanent ice. We conclude that the people's responses to these changes will depend on availability of institutions to manage pastures, other household resources, and perceptions of these biophysical changes. Socioenvironmental change is not new in the study area, but current shifts will likely force this community to alter its rules of access to pastures, its economic rationales in regards to commodities produced, and the degree of dependence on seasonal wage labor.

The criteria were evaluated using an analysis of the relative transpiration rate (the ratio of the actual transpiration to the potential transpiration) over a 30-day period following sowing (initial growth stage) by means of a soil water balance model (BUDGET). Crop failure or a false start to the season was indicated by a relative transpiration rate of less than 35% over the 30 days. The first recommended planting dates have been identified for a number of stations in the six agro-ecological zones of Zimbabwe and for the last 30 years, using three different criteria. The criteria included two, which are currently utilized in Zimbabwe: the AREX criterion of the Agricultural Research Extension (25 mm rainfall in 7 days) and the MET criterion of the Department of Meteorological Services (40 mm in 15 days). A third criterion, DEPTH (40 mm in 4 days), based on farmers practices, is introduced in this paper. In general, for all agro-ecological zones, the earliest planting dates were found with the AREX criterion. Those generated by the MET criterion are typically 7-10 days later. The planting dates generated by the DEPTH criterion are some 2-3 weeks later than the AREX dates. The evaluation revealed that in non-failure years, the relative transpiration rate over the 30 days is about 70% for all criteria and for all zones. However, the risk a farmer runs of a false start when applying the AREX criterion is unacceptably high (1 year out of 2). Applying the MET criterion reduces the failures to 2 years out of 5 and when the DEPTH criterion is applied, the probability of failure drops to 1 year out of 4.","The steadiness of these characteristics determines the success or failure of sowing, growing and harvesting (Ambrosino et al., 2014;Kniveton et al., 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2004).","[""The farmers' reports and concerns reflect the strong influence of several features in the annual precipitation cycle on farmers' lives and the agricultural year in the Cuenca Auqui."", 'The steadiness of these characteristics determines the success or failure of sowing, growing and harvesting (Ambrosino et al., 2014;Kniveton et al., 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2004).', ""To extract the agriculturally relevant information from the seasonal cycles of daily precipitation to be compared with the farmers' experiences, we defined eight criteria, mainly empirically and inspired by methods presented, for example, by Laux et al.

We applied this approach to 268 smallholder households using information from two existing regional assessments and from our own household survey. The cluster analysis revealed four vulnerability patterns that depict typical combinations of household attributes, including their harvest failure risk, agricultural resources, education level and non-agricultural income. We validated the identified vulnerability patterns by demonstrating the correlation between them and an independently reported damage: the purchase of food and fodder resulting from exposure to weather extremes. The vulnerability patterns were then ranked according to the different amounts of purchase. A second validation aspect accounted for independently reported mechanisms explaining smallholders' sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Based on the similarities among the households, our study contributes to the understanding of vulnerability beyond individual cases. In particular, the validation strengthens the credibility and suitability of our findings for decision-making pertaining to the reduction of vulnerability.","The peasant families of the R�_o Auqui watershed cultivate an average area of around 3 hectares per family which are distributed in small plots over different altitudes of the valley (Fig. 1) in order to guarantee diversified production for each family (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012;Vos, 2010;Zimmerer, 2011).","['The peasant families of the R�_o Auqui watershed cultivate an average area of around 3 hectares per family which are distributed in small plots over different altitudes of the valley (Fig. 1) in order to guarantee diversified production for each family (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012;Vos, 2010;Zimmerer, 2011).', 'If possible, families combine irrigation and rain-fed agriculture, but overall only few are privileged in having access to irrigation for year-round cultivation.', 'The large majority of the families depend entirely on rain-fed agriculture and, consequently, on precipitation.', 'The cultivation calendar in Fig. 2 results from our interviews and fieldwork.']",0,"['The peasant families of the R�_o Auqui watershed cultivate an average area of around 3 hectares per family which are distributed in small plots over different altitudes of the valley (Fig. 1) in order to guarantee diversified production for each family (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012;Vos, 2010;Zimmerer, 2011).', 'If possible, families combine irrigation and rain-fed agriculture, but overall only few are privileged in having access to irrigation for year-round cultivation.', 'The large majority of the families depend entirely on rain-fed agriculture and, consequently, on precipitation.']"

The onset and end dates are determined by averaging daily rainfall data from many stations, and then constructing 5-day averages (pentads). Onset (end) is defined as the pentad in which rainfall exceeds (falls below) a given threshold, provided that average rainfall was well below (above) the threshold for several pentads preceding onset (end), and well above (below) the threshold for several pentads after onset (end). For the criteria chosen, the climatological onset progresses toward the southeast, arriving in mid-October, and then toward the mouth of the Amazon, arriving near the end of the year. The end dates are earliest in the southeast and progress toward the north, but withdrawal is slower than onset. The onset dates, however, are quite sensitive to changes in the threshold. If the threshold is doubled, for example, the sense of onset is reversed, with onset occurring toward the northwest. Changes in threshold do not change the direction of the progression of the end of the rainy season. The central Amazon shows the largest variation in the date of onset. In several years, onset in the southeast occurs before that in the central Amazon, but onset near the mouth is always latest. There is an unexpectedly low relationship between the length of the rainy season and total accumulation. Likewise, there is little relationship between the onset (and end) date and the total accumulation. Composites of outgoing longwave radiation and the low-level wind field show that in the central Amazon, onset is associated with an anomalous anticyclone and enhanced trade winds in the Atlantic. Near the mouth of the Amazon, however, onset is associated with large-scale northerly anomalies, and the zonal component of the trade winds is reduced. There is an apparent association between sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Atlantic and Pacific and the pentads of onset and end of the rainy season in the northern and central Amazon, and near its mouth. The sense is that a warm Pacific and cold Atlantic result in a delayed onset and early withdrawal.

Rietjens"", ""Clive Seale"", ""Jane Seymour"", ""Luc Deliens"", ""Agnes van der Heide""]","Existing empirical evidence shows that continuous deep sedation until death is given in about 15% of all deaths in Flanders, Belgium (BE), 8% in The Netherlands (NL), and 17% in the U.K.This study compares characteristics of continuous deep sedation to explain these varying frequencies.In Flanders, BE (2007) and NL (2005), death certificate studies were conducted. Questionnaires about continuous deep sedation and other decisions were sent to the certifying physicians of each death from a stratified sample (Flanders, BE: n=6927; NL: n=6860). In the U.K. in 2007-2008, questionnaires were sent to 8857 randomly sampled physicians asking them about the last death attended.The total number of deaths studied was 11,704 of which 1517 involved continuous deep sedation. In Dutch hospitals, continuous deep sedation was significantly less often provided (11%) compared with hospitals in Flanders, BE (20%) and the U.K. (17%). In U.K. home settings, continuous deep sedation was more common (19%) than in Flanders, BE (10%) or NL (8%). In NL in both settings, continuous deep sedation more often involved benzodiazepines and lasted less than 24 hours. Physicians in Flanders combined continuous deep sedation with a decision to provide physician-assisted death more often. Overall, men, younger patients, and patients with malignancies were more likely to receive continuous deep sedation, although this was not always significant within each country.Differences in the prevalence of continuous deep sedation appear to reflect complex legal, cultural, and organizational factors more than differences in patients' characteristics or clinical profiles.

Design: Postal survey, conducted between May and July 1996, using a self-administered questionnaire based on the questionnaire used to determine medical end-of-life decisions in the Netherlands in 1995. Participants: A random sample of active medical practitioners from all Australian States and Territories selected from medical disciplines in which there were opportunities to be the attending doctor at non-acute patient deaths, and hence to make medical end-of-life decisions. Main outcome measure: Proportion of Australian deaths that involved a medical end-of-life decision, using ratio-to-size estimation based on the sampled doctors' responses to the questionnaire. The response rate was 64%. Results: The proportion of all Australian deaths that involved a medical end-of-life decision were: euthanasia, 1.8% (including physician-assisted suicide, 0.1%); ending of patient's life without patient's concurrent explicit request, 3.5%; withholding or withdrawing of potentially life-prolonging treatment, 28.6%; alleviation of pain with opioids in doses large enough that there was a probable life-shortening effect, 30.9%. In 30% of all Australian deaths, a medical end-of-life decision was made with the explicit intention of ending the patient's life, of which 4% were in response to a direct request from the patient. Overall, Australia had a higher rate of intentional ending of life without the patient's request than the Netherlands.

Prototype?,Jan Bernheim,Legalizing Euthanasia or Assisted Suicide: The Illusion of Safeguards and Controls,"[""Jos\u00e9 Pereira""]","Euthanasia or assisted suicide--and sometimes both-- have been legalized in a small number of countries and states. In all jurisdictions, laws and safeguards were put in place to prevent abuse and misuse of these practices. Prevention measures have included, among others, explicit consent by the person requesting euthanasia, mandatory reporting of all cases, administration only by physicians (with the exception of Switzerland), and consultation by a second physician. The present paper provides evidence that these laws and safeguards are regularly ignored and transgressed in all the jurisdictions and that transgressions are not prosecuted. For example, about 900 people annually are administered lethal substances without having given explicit consent, and in one jurisdiction, almost 50% of cases of euthanasia are not reported. Increased tolerance of transgressions in societies with such laws represents a social ""slippery slope,"" as do changes to the laws and criteria that followed legalization. Although the initial intent was to limit euthanasia and assisted suicide to a lastresort option for a very small number of terminally ill people, some jurisdictions now extend the practice to newborns, children, and people with dementia. A terminal illness is no longer a prerequisite. In the Netherlands, euthanasia for anyone over the age of 70 who is ""tired of living"" is now being considered. Legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide therefore places many people at risk, affects the values of society over time, and does not provide controls and safeguards.","Some took issue with the data and pragmatic considerations, arguing that the legal safeguards against abuse are insufficiently enforced (Materstvedt 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG 2011;Cohen-Almagor 2013), and others aimed to refute the conclusions on fundamental ideological grounds (Jaspers, M�_ller-Busch, and Nauck 2009;Kettler and Nauck 2010;Johnstone 2012;Materstvedt 2012).","['Since 2008 several papers have vigorously challenged this ""synergy"" article, with two main types of criticism.', 'Some took issue with the data and pragmatic considerations, arguing that the legal safeguards against abuse are insufficiently enforced (Materstvedt 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG 2011;Cohen-Almagor 2013), and others aimed to refute the conclusions on fundamental ideological grounds (Jaspers, M�_ller-Busch, and Nauck 2009;Kettler and Nauck 2010;Johnstone 2012;Materstvedt 2012).', 'The ""synergy"" paper proposed the concept of ""integral palliative care"" to denote the Federation of Palliative Care Flanders\' (FPCFl) endorsement and integration of euthanasia.', 'To date, worldwide, this is the only professional PC organisation to have done so (Federatie Palliatieve Zorg Vlaanderen 2003;Vanden Berghe et al. 2013).', 'We have also argued that some individual patients\' requests for euthanasia stem from their judgement that the initiation or pursuit of palliative care is ""futile.""', 'This is because PC does not or no longer meets the needs and wishes of those patients who prefer to have assistance to die rather than a protracted ""natural"" death in a palliative care program (however well-intentioned and however good the support and symptom control).', 'Both concepts of ""integral"" and ""futile"" palliative care have been ideologically challenged in the last few years (Jaspers, M�_ller-Busch, and Nauck 2009;Kettler and Nauck 2010;Johnstone 2012;Materstvedt 2012).', 'A response to these theoretical objections is in preparation.']",1,"['Some took issue with the data and pragmatic considerations, arguing that the legal safeguards against abuse are insufficiently enforced (Materstvedt 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG 2011;Cohen-Almagor 2013), and others aimed to refute the conclusions on fundamental ideological grounds (Jaspers, M�_ller-Busch, and Nauck 2009;Kettler and Nauck 2010;Johnstone 2012;Materstvedt 2012).']"

The certifying physician of each death was sent a questionnaire on end of life decision making in the death concerned.The rate of euthanasia cases reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee; physicians' reasons for not reporting cases of euthanasia; the relation between reporting and non-reporting and the characteristics of the physician and patient; the time by which life was shortened according to the physician; the labelling of the end of life decision by the physician involved; and differences in characteristics of due care between reported and unreported euthanasia cases.The survey response rate was 58.4% (3623/6202 eligible cases). The estimated total number of cases of euthanasia in Flanders in 2007 was 1040 (95% CI 970 to 1109), thus the incidence of euthanasia was estimated as 1.9% of all deaths (95% CI 1.6% to 2.3%).

However, it raises numerous medical, ethical, emotional and legal concerns, such as the reducing or removing of consciousness (and thus potentially causing 'subjective death'), the withholding of artificial nutrition and hydration, the proportionality of the sedation to the symptoms, its adequacy in actually relieving symptoms rather than simply giving onlookers the impression that the patient is undergoing a painless 'natural' death, and the perception that it may be functionally equivalent to euthanasia. This book brings together contributions from clinicians, ethicists, lawyers and social scientists, and discusses guidelines as well as clinical, emotional and legal aspects of the practice.

To emphasize the involvement of anaesthesiology in palliative care.Euthanasia has been legalized in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxemburg (BENELUX countries). A group from Belgium has now proposed using euthanasia in patients in whom palliative care has been deemed 'futile'. This practice of so-called 'integral palliative care' is strongly rejected in a study from Germany. Palliative sedation is an ethically different approach with no intention to kill the patient. The European Association of Palliative Care has proposed a framework for individual guidelines for palliative sedation. The important role of anaesthesiology in palliative care teams is emphasized.Palliative care is a powerful approach to patient care during terminal illness, emphasizing quality of life even if it may shorten the length of life. Traditionally, palliative care has been contrasted with active euthanasia, but a group from Belgium has challenged this concept recently, advocating the use of euthanasia in circumstances in which palliative care has become 'futile'. This new approach led to strong reactions by a group from Germany, stressing that killing on demand in palliative care should under no circumstances be justified. In contrast, palliative sedation is a common method in special cases to reduce intractable symptoms. A new framework for palliative sedation produced by the European Association of Palliative Care may encourage institutions to set up their own palliative sedation guidelines. Worldwide, anaesthesiologists have a significant role in palliative care due to their unique complex expertise mainly in pain therapy and including transient sedation of patients.","Some took issue with the data and pragmatic considerations, arguing that the legal safeguards against abuse are insufficiently enforced (Materstvedt 2009;Pereira 2011;Cohen-Almagor 2013), and others aimed to refute the conclusions on fundamental ideological grounds (Jaspers, M�_ller-Busch, and Nauck 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG and Nauck 2010;Johnstone 2012;Materstvedt 2012).","['Since 2008 several papers have vigorously challenged this ""synergy"" article, with two main types of criticism.', 'Some took issue with the data and pragmatic considerations, arguing that the legal safeguards against abuse are insufficiently enforced (Materstvedt 2009;Pereira 2011;Cohen-Almagor 2013), and others aimed to refute the conclusions on fundamental ideological grounds (Jaspers, M�_ller-Busch, and Nauck 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG and Nauck 2010;Johnstone 2012;Materstvedt 2012).', 'The ""synergy"" paper proposed the concept of ""integral palliative care"" to denote the Federation of Palliative Care Flanders\' (FPCFl) endorsement and integration of euthanasia.', 'To date, worldwide, this is the only professional PC organisation to have done so (Federatie Palliatieve Zorg Vlaanderen 2003;Vanden Berghe et al. 2013).', 'We have also argued that some individual patients\' requests for euthanasia stem from their judgement that the initiation or pursuit of palliative care is ""futile.""', 'This is because PC does not or no longer meets the needs and wishes of those patients who prefer to have assistance to die rather than a protracted ""natural"" death in a palliative care program (however well-intentioned and however good the support and symptom control).', 'Both concepts of ""integral"" and ""futile"" palliative care have been ideologically challenged in the last few years (Jaspers, M�_ller-Busch, and Nauck 2009;Kettler and Nauck 2010;Johnstone 2012;Materstvedt 2012).', 'A response to these theoretical objections is in preparation.']",1,"['Since 2008 several papers have vigorously challenged this ""synergy"" article, with two main types of criticism.', 'Some took issue with the data and pragmatic considerations, arguing that the legal safeguards against abuse are insufficiently enforced (Materstvedt 2009;Pereira 2011;Cohen-Almagor 2013), and others aimed to refute the conclusions on fundamental ideological grounds (Jaspers, M�_ller-Busch, and Nauck 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG and Nauck 2010;Johnstone 2012;Materstvedt 2012).', 'The ""synergy"" paper proposed the concept of ""integral palliative care"" to denote the Federation of Palliative Care Flanders\' (FPCFl) endorsement and integration of euthanasia.']"

These laws stipulate, among other things, that the attending physician should consult an independent colleague to judge whether the substantive criteria of due care have been met. In this context initiatives were taken in the Netherlands and Belgium to establish specialized services providing such consultants: Support and Consultation for Euthanasia in the Netherlands (SCEN) and Life End Information Forum (LEIF) in Belgium. The aim of this study is to describe and compare these initiatives.We studied and compared relevant documents concerning the Dutch and Belgian consultation service (e.g. articles of bye-laws, inventories of activities, training books, consultation protocols).In both countries, the consultation services are delivered by trained physicians who can be consulted in cases of a request for euthanasia and who offer support and information to attending physicians. The context in which the two organisations were founded, as well as the way they are organised and regulated, is different in each country. By providing information on all end-of-life care matters, the Belgian LEIF seems to have a broader consultation role than the Dutch SCEN. SCEN on the other hand has a longer history, is more regulated and organised on a larger scale and receives more government funding than LEIF. The number of training hours for physicians is equal. However, SCEN-training puts more emphasis on the consultation report, whereas LEIF-training primarily emphasizes the ethical framework of end-of-life decisions.In case of a request for euthanasia, in the Netherlands as well as in Belgium similar consultation services by independent qualified physicians have been developed. In countries where legalising physician-assisted death is being contemplated, the development of such a consultation provision could also be considered in order to safeguard the practice of euthanasia (as it can provide safeguards to adequate performance of euthanasia and assisted suicide).","In both the French-speaking Belgium Forum EOL (End of Life) and the Netherlands SCEN (Steun en Consultatie voor Euthanasie Nederland) doctors are available for this service (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009a, 2009b.","['In Flanders, physicians, many of whom are unfamiliar with the regulations and the clinical practice of euthanasia, can call on their colleagues from the Life-End Information Forum (LEIF) for both the legally required second-opinion consultation by an independent physician and for technical assistance in the practice of euthanasia.', 'In both the French-speaking Belgium Forum EOL (End of Life) and the Netherlands SCEN (Steun en Consultatie voor Euthanasie Nederland) doctors are available for this service (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009a, 2009b.', 'The consultation by an independent physician that is legally required is remunerated in the Netherlands, but not yet in Belgium.', 'More than 400 Flemish physicians have undertaken the LEIF training since 2003, the palliative care component of which is entrusted to the Palliative Care Federation of Flanders.', 'LEIF physicians are known to explicitly endorse euthanasia as one more option at the end of life.', 'About 1,000 physicians have followed palliative care training since 1998, partly theoretical, but mainly by means of case conferences and clinical placement experience.', 'The objective of training in palliative care is ""emancipatory,""']",2,"['In both the French-speaking Belgium Forum EOL (End of Life) and the Netherlands SCEN (Steun en Consultatie voor Euthanasie Nederland) doctors are available for this service (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009a, 2009b.']"
CC2389,81068384,Questions and Answers on the Belgian Model of Integral End-of-Life Care: Experiment? Prototype?,Jan Bernheim,How have you been Subjective quality of life QOL as an individual experiential emergent construct,"[""Jan L. Bernham""]","Medical, scientific and societal progress has been such that, in a universalist humanist perspective such as the WHO's, it has become an ethical imperative for the primary endpoints in evidence based health care research to be expressed in e.g. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The classical endpoints of discrete health-related functions and duration of survival are increasingly perceived as unacceptably reductionistic. The major problem in 'felicitometrics' is the measurement of the 'quality' term in QALYs. That the mental, physical and social domains, each containing many dimensions and items, all contribute to QOL is uncontroversial. What is controversial, is the weight of the different dimensions in overall QOL. It has been shown to be very different between different patient populations. In human individuals, assuredly complex systems, the many dimensions and items of QOL observably interact, probably sometimes in chaotic ways. In these conditions, the weights of isolated items in individuals become for all practical purposes meaningless. Therefore, the much used multi-item questionnaires at best describe, but do not evaluate QOL, neither in individuals, nor in populations. For example, allergic patients treated with cetirizine scored better than those on placebo on all dimensions of the SF-36, a standard QOL questionnaire. Here there is no serious doubt that the treatment improved QOL, because it is highly unlikely that any important dimension on which the patient groups would have scored otherwise is missing in the SF-36. However, whether piracetam treatment of acute stroke, which improved the surrogate endpoints neurological and functional scores, also improved QOL is plausible, but will be proven only when comprehensive QOL measurement will have been done. And suppose in randomised populations of end-stage metastatic solid cancer patients, one would compare palliative last-line chemotherapy with only palliative care, and one would, as can be expected, find no significant differences in average survival, and chemotherapy superior for the mental domain, but inferior for the physical comfort domain: we would not know which treatment, on aggregate, would be the better. The problem is that QOL is an individual and emergent construct, the resultant of a great many interactions, and of a different order than its contributing components. Overall QOL can therefore best be captured only as the Gestalt of a global self-assessment. Just as people in everyday life, while acting under uncertainty, make global assessments all the time, so they can seriously answer the serious question: 'How have you been?' A solemn, practical, non peer-relativistic, non-cultural, experiential, and well tolerated way to obtain such responses is Anamnestic Comparative Self Assessment (ACSA), in which the subjects' memories of the best and the worst times in their life experience define their individual scale of QOL. ACSA is thus both exquisitely idiosyncratic, and yet can in a universalist humanistic perspective be considered generic. Using both a multi-item questionnaire and a global assessment allows by one logistic regression, to estimate the weights of the dimensions and items in populations, and thus identify those whose improvement would most contribute to the QOL of the greatest number. A combined approach to measurement of QOL is necessary to maximise the utility of QOL interventions.","Applying Anamnestic Comparative Self Assessment (ACSA), a method to let respondents construct a personal scale of subjective well-being (#AUTHOR_TAG 1999b;Theuns, Hofmans;, as an instrument of spiritual care, Desmet asks his patient what was the happiest time in her life.","['The relationship between euthanasia and spiritual or existential caregiving to the patient has been examined in a study involving the last three months of life of patients of a representative panel of Belgian general practitioners (Van den Block et al. 2009).', 'When euthanasia was performed, there was clear evidence of exceptionally high levels of spiritual or existential care.', 'Religious or existential care is therefore not excluded at all from the care of people who request euthanasia but, rather, connected to it.', 'Since in Belgium, which predominantly has a Catholic tradition, this type of care is more often religious than secular, we can infer that religious beliefs often do not, as a matter of course, restrain many patients from presenting requests for euthanasia.', 'A new development is what we term ""solemn or ceremonial"" euthanasia, carried out at a predetermined time and place, among family loved ones and sometimes also in the presence of a pastor who has administered the last rites.', 'For example, a recent documentary followed a cancer patient over the last six months of her life in palliative care and ends with her euthanasia in the supportive company of her family and friends that takes place in her home and is carried out by her general practitioner (GP) and palliative care nurse (Lanssens 2011).', 'Another documentary showed a 90-year-old woman with refractory cancer symptoms preparing to undergo euthanasia and her interactions prior to doing so with Dr. Marc Desmet, a respected Belgian palliative care physician who is also a Jesuit priest (Gilsenan 2012).', 'Applying Anamnestic Comparative Self Assessment (ACSA), a method to let respondents construct a personal scale of subjective well-being (#AUTHOR_TAG 1999b;Theuns, Hofmans;, as an instrument of spiritual care, Desmet asks his patient what was the happiest time in her life.', '""Assisting my parents to die at home,"" she replies.', 'Patient and doctor communicate warmly.', ""When Dr. Desmet is asked by the interviewer Alan Gilsenan whether his religious beliefs are not an obstacle to granting euthanasia, the physician points out that according to Christian tradition one's conscience and compassion trump doctrine."", 'He will entrust the patient to a colleague rather than performing the euthanasia himself, but he will accompany his patients ""as far as he can go.""', 'Dr. Desmet had previously debated author JB and written a book opposing euthanasia (Desmet 2000).', 'He now heads the ethics group of the Flemish Association for Palliative Care (Vanden Berghe et al. 2013).']",4,"['Applying Anamnestic Comparative Self Assessment (ACSA), a method to let respondents construct a personal scale of subjective well-being (#AUTHOR_TAG 1999b;Theuns, Hofmans;, as an instrument of spiritual care, Desmet asks his patient what was the happiest time in her life.']"

Prototype?,Jan Bernheim,Organization Position Statements and the Stance of â€œStudied Neutralityâ€ on Euthanasia in Palliative Care,"[""Megan-Jane Johnstone""]","In recent years, palliative care and related organizations have increasingly adopted a stance of ""studied neutrality"" on the question of whether euthanasia should be legalized as a bona fide medical regimen in palliative care contexts. This stance, however, has attracted criticism from both opponents and proponents of euthanasia. Pro-euthanasia activists see the stance as an official position of indecision that is fundamentally disrespectful of a patient's right to ""choose death"" when life has become unbearable. Some palliative care constituents, in turn, are opposed to the stance, contending that it reflects an attitude of ""going soft"" on euthanasia and as weakening the political resistance that has hitherto been successful in preventing euthanasia from becoming more widely legalized. In this article, attention is given to examining critically the notion and possible unintended consequences of adopting a stance of studied neutrality on euthanasia in palliative care. It is argued that although palliative care and related organizations have an obvious stake in the outcome of the euthanasia debate, it is neither unreasonable nor inconsistent for such organizations to be unwilling to take a definitive stance on the issue.

M. van Delden""]","Background: Legalizing euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is a current topic of debate in many countries. The Netherlands is the only country where legislation covers both. Objectives: To study physicians' experiences and attitudes concerning the choice between euthanasia and PAS. Methods: A questionnaire including vignettes was sent to a random sample of 1955 Dutch general practitioners, elderly care physicians and medical specialists. Results: In total, 793 physicians (41%) participated. There was no clear preference for euthanasia (36%) or PAS (34%). Two thirds of physicians thought that PAS underlines the autonomy and responsibility of the patient and considered this a reason to choose PAS. Reasons for not choosing PAS were expected practical problems. A minority (22%) discussed the possibility of PAS with their patient in case of a request for assistance in dying. Patients receiving PAS more often experienced psychosocial suffering in comparison with patients receiving euthanasia. In vignettes of patients with a request for assistance in dying due to psychosocial suffering, physicians agreed more often with the performance of PAS than with euthanasia. Conclusion: Dutch physicians perceive a difference between euthanasia and PAS. Although they believe PAS underlines patient autonomy and responsibility, the option of PAS is rarely discussed with the patient. The more psychosocial in nature the patient's suffering, the more physicians choose PAS. In these cases, PAS seems to fulfil physicians' preferences to emphasize patient autonomy and responsibility. Expected technical problems and unfamiliarity with PAS also play a role. Paradoxically, the choice for PAS is predominantly a physician's one.

Furthermore, the idea of 'palliative futility' associated with the model is shown to be incoherent. In countries where assisted dying is legal, palliative care providers should refrain from participating in such practices if they are to remain true to the basic values of such care.
