CC801,52129671,Reliability of Objectively Measured Sedentary Time and Physical Activity in Adults,Eivind Aadland,Impact of accelerometer wear time on physical activity data: a NHANES semisimulation data approach,"[""Stephen D Herrmann"", ""Tiago V Barreira"", ""Minsoo Kang"", ""Barbara E Ainsworth""]","Current research practice employs wide-ranging accelerometer wear time criteria to identify a valid day of physical activity (PA) measurement.To evaluate the effects of varying amounts of daily accelerometer wear time on PA data.A total of 1000 days of accelerometer data from 1000 participants (age=38.7 +- 14.3 years; body mass index=28.2 +- 6.7 kg/m(2)) were selected from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Study data set. A reference data set was created using 200 random days with 14 h/day of wear time. Four additional samples of 200 days were randomly selected with a wear time of 10, 11, 12 and 13 h/day(1). These data sets were used in day-to-day comparison to create four semisimulation data sets (10, 11, 12, 13 h/day) from the reference data set. Differences in step count and time spent in inactivity (<100 cts/min), light (100-1951 cts/min), moderate (1952-5724 cts/min) and vigorous (>=5725 cts/min) intensity PA were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance and absolute percent error (APE).There were significant differences for moderate intensity PA between the reference data set and semisimulation data sets of 10 and 11 h/day. Differences were observed in 10-13 h/day(1) for inactivity and light intensity PA, and 10-12 h/day for steps (all p values <0.05). APE increased with shorter wear time (13 h/day=3.9-14.1%; 12 h/day=9.9-15.2%, 11 h/day=17.1-35.5%; 10 h/day=24.6-40.3%).These data suggest that using accelerometer wear time criteria of 12 h/day or less may underestimate step count and time spent in various PA levels.","This clearly indicates that wear time should be considered a crucial variable in data reduction and analysis of accelerometer data, which is consistent with findings of a recent study #AUTHOR_TAG.","['The present study is the first to investigate the week-by-week reliability of measurements of SED and PA, as obtained by accelerometry in adults, using absolute measures of reliability.', 'There was a clear difference in reliability for SED reported in terms of minutes/day (absolute measure) compared to as a percentage value of the valid wear time (relative measure), favoring the latter.', 'This disparate finding is caused by the strong relationship between wear time and SED.', 'Thus, adjustment for wear time reduced the variability in SED (min/day) considerably and left similar ICC as for SED (%).', 'Absolute measures of reliability showed that week-byweek differences must be expected to be substantial for all outcome variables.', 'Contrary to our hypothesis, the reliability of SED and PA were similar, or, when variability was reported relative to the mean values; considerably better for SED compared to PA.', 'Although wear time criteria differ between studies, many studies employ a wear time criteria of !10 hours/day for !3-5 days/week to constitute a valid accelerometer measurement in adults [22,16,14,17,13,12].', 'These criteria are in line with current recommendations [22,2].', 'The present findings suggest that the number of days to be considered a valid measurement might be increased to a full week or longer to achieve an ICC of 0.80, which is currently the most applied desired reliability level.', 'Consistent with previous studies [6,8], we found impaired reliability for SED (min/day) compared to PA.', 'This could indicate that SED is a behavior that are difficult to capture as it might vary more on a day-by-day basis than other activities that are performed on a higher intensity-level.', 'However, SED given as a relative measure (percentage of valid wear time) was superior to SED reported in absolute term (minutes/ day) (requiring 7 vs. 15 days of measurement for the !10 h criteria) in the present study.', 'This finding results from a considerable day-to-day variation in wear time, given the very strong relationship between wear time and SED (min/day) shown in the present study.', 'Using a !10 h !4d criteria, wear time must be expected to differ by >2 hours/day between subsequent weeks.', 'Given the strong relationship between wear time and SED (�_ = 0.709: i.e., 1 minute change in wear time would translate into~43 sec change in SED time), adjustment for wear time reduced the variability for SED by~37%.', 'A relatively strong relationship with wear time was also shown for LPA, whereas weaker (although statistically significant) relationships were found for other variables.', 'This clearly indicates that wear time should be considered a crucial variable in data reduction and analysis of accelerometer data, which is consistent with findings of a recent study #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Herrmann et al [33] showed patterns across 10 to 14 hours of wear time in a simulation study based on NHANES data which coincide with the present findings.', 'Thus, our findings, along with those of others, shows that SED and PA as determined by accelerometry, should be either reported as percentage values or, alternatively, analyses could be adjusted for wear time, which might be preferred if appropriate.', 'Studies that have investigated the association between SED and cardio-metabolic health vary considerable in their applied operationalization of SED, using absolute values without adjustment for wear time [14,19], absolute values with adjustment for wear time [15,17,20], percentage values [16,13] or a combination of several approaches [18,12].', 'Thus, variation in reliability might be one source to explain disparate findings across studies.']",0,"['This clearly indicates that wear time should be considered a crucial variable in data reduction and analysis of accelerometer data, which is consistent with findings of a recent study #AUTHOR_TAG.']"

Five algorithms, varying nonwear criteria (20 vs. 60 min of 0 counts) and minimum wear requirements (6 vs. 10 hrs/day for >= 4 days) and a separate algorithm requiring >= 3 counts per min and >= 2 hours per day, were used to process the accelerometer data.Processing the accelerometer data with different algorithms resulted in different levels of counts per day, sedentary, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.

CC803,52129671,Reliability of Objectively Measured Sedentary Time and Physical Activity in Adults,Eivind Aadland,Objectively measured light-intensity lifestyle activity and sedentary time are independently associated with metabolic syndrome: a cross-sectional study of Japanese adults,"[""Junghoon Kim"", ""Kai Tanabe"", ""Noriko Yokoyama"", ""Hirofumi Zempo"", ""Shinya Kuno""]","Reducing sedentary time and increasing lifestyle activities, including light-intensity activity, may be an option to help prevent metabolic syndrome (MetS). The purpose of the present study was to examine whether objectively measured light-intensity lifestyle activity and sedentary time is associated with MetS, independent of moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA).The participants in this cross-sectional study were 483 middle-aged Japanese adults, aged 30-64 years. The participants were divided into those with or without MetS according to the Japanese criteria for MetS. A triaxial accelerometer was used to measure light-intensity lifestyle activity [1.6-2.9 metabolic equivalents (METs)] and sedentary time (<=1.5 METs). Logistic regression was used to predict MetS from the levels of light-intensity lifestyle activity and sedentary time with age, sex, smoking, calorie intake, accelerometer wear time, and MVPA as covariates.The odds ratios (OR) for MetS in the highest and middle tertiles of light-intensity lifestyle activity were 0.44 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24 to 0.81] and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.29 to 0.89) relative to the lowest tertile, after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, calorie intake, accelerometer wear time and MVPA (Ptrend = 0.012). Sedentary time was also associated with the risk of MetS (Ptrend = 0.018). Among participants in the highest tertile of sedentary time, the risk of MetS was 2.27-times greater than that in the lowest tertile (95% CI: 1.25 to 4.11). The risk of MetS was not significantly increased in subjects in the middle tertile of sedentary time.We found that light-intensity lifestyle activity and sedentary time were significantly associated with the risk of MetS, independent of MVPA. The results of our study suggest that public health messages and guidelines should be refined to include increases in light-intensity lifestyle activity and/or decreases in sedentary time, alongside promoting MVPA, to prevent MetS.","Inconsistent conclusions across studies might amongst other reasons arrive from unreliable measurements of SED, as most of these studies have included !3-5 days of measurement [12][13][14][15][16][17], with some exceptions (!1 day [18]; !6-7 days [19,#AUTHOR_TAG]).","['In adults, !3-5 days of monitoring are normally considered appropriate, which is in accordance with recommendations given [2].', 'However, estimates of how many days of monitoring that should be included to obtain a reliable result vary considerably between studies [3-7, 2, 8], and might also vary between outcome variables of interest [6,8].', 'According to Matthews et al [6], inclusion of more days may be needed to arrive at reliable estimates (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) !0.80) for ""physical inactivity"" (<500 cpm from the Actigraph 7164) (!7 days), compared to PA (! 3-4 days).', 'A comparable finding has been shown in older adults, where 2-3 days was needed for PA, whereas 5 days of monitoring was needed for SED (<50 cpm from the Actigraph 7164).', 'The possible impaired reliability for SED compared to other variables may be of critical importance, given the increased interest in SED in the primary and secondary prevention of a range of chronic diseases as well as premature death [9][10][11].', 'Inconsistent conclusions across studies might amongst other reasons arrive from unreliable measurements of SED, as most of these studies have included !3-5 days of measurement [12][13][14][15][16][17], with some exceptions (!1 day [18]; !6-7 days [19,#AUTHOR_TAG]).', 'Moreover, as SED are likely to be related to wear time, correction for wear time might improve reliability.', 'Consistent with this hypothesis, percent SED has previously been shown to be superior to minutes of SED as a predictor of metabolic risk [18].']",0,"['Inconsistent conclusions across studies might amongst other reasons arrive from unreliable measurements of SED, as most of these studies have included !3-5 days of measurement [12][13][14][15][16][17], with some exceptions (!1 day [18]; !6-7 days [19,#AUTHOR_TAG]).']"

MetS was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Logistic regressions examined the associations between the subcomponents of physical activity and sedentary behavior and the odds of having MetS or individual risk factors.MetS was observed in 10.2% of men and 5.2% of women. Adults who spent >=60 min*d-1 in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were 68%-81% less likely to have abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL cholesterol compared with those with <30 min*d MVPA, independent of sex, age, education, smoking, alcohol consumption, and total sedentary time. The total sedentary time and the average duration of a sedentary bout were positively associated with MetS and most of its individual risk factors (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07-1.47). Breaks in sedentary time were inversely associated with abdominal obesity (OR = 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.55-0.91) and hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99). These associations were no longer significant after adjustment for MVPA (and total sedentary time). Light physical activity was not associated with MetS or any of the individual risk factors. Time spent in moderate, vigorous, total MVPA, and bouts of MVPA were associated with a reduced likelihood of abdominal obesity (OR = <0.01-0.48), hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 0.14-0.63), and low HDL cholesterol (OR = 0.02-0.43), independent of potential confounders and total sedentary time.Engagement in MVPA may be essential to prevent MetS and individual risk factors.","Inconsistent conclusions across studies might amongst other reasons arrive from unreliable measurements of SED, as most of these studies have included !3-5 days of measurement [12][13][14][15][16][17], with some exceptions (!1 day [18]; !6-7 days [#AUTHOR_TAG,20]).","['In adults, !3-5 days of monitoring are normally considered appropriate, which is in accordance with recommendations given [2].', 'However, estimates of how many days of monitoring that should be included to obtain a reliable result vary considerably between studies [3-7, 2, 8], and might also vary between outcome variables of interest [6,8].', 'According to Matthews et al [6], inclusion of more days may be needed to arrive at reliable estimates (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) !0.80) for ""physical inactivity"" (<500 cpm from the Actigraph 7164) (!7 days), compared to PA (! 3-4 days).', 'A comparable finding has been shown in older adults, where 2-3 days was needed for PA, whereas 5 days of monitoring was needed for SED (<50 cpm from the Actigraph 7164).', 'The possible impaired reliability for SED compared to other variables may be of critical importance, given the increased interest in SED in the primary and secondary prevention of a range of chronic diseases as well as premature death [9][10][11].', 'Inconsistent conclusions across studies might amongst other reasons arrive from unreliable measurements of SED, as most of these studies have included !3-5 days of measurement [12][13][14][15][16][17], with some exceptions (!1 day [18]; !6-7 days [#AUTHOR_TAG,20]).', 'Moreover, as SED are likely to be related to wear time, correction for wear time might improve reliability.', 'Consistent with this hypothesis, percent SED has previously been shown to be superior to minutes of SED as a predictor of metabolic risk [18].']",0,"['Inconsistent conclusions across studies might amongst other reasons arrive from unreliable measurements of SED, as most of these studies have included !3-5 days of measurement [12][13][14][15][16][17], with some exceptions (!1 day [18]; !6-7 days [#AUTHOR_TAG,20]).']"

Griffin"", ""Nicholas J. Wareham"", "" ""]","OBJECTIVE We sought to examine the independent associations between different dimensions of physical activity with intermediary and clustered metabolic risk factors in overweight individuals with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes to inform future preventive action.   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We measured total body movement and five other subcomponents of physical activity by accelerometry in 258 adults (aged 30-50 years) with a family history of type 2 diabetes. We estimated aerobic fitness from an incremental treadmill exercise test. We measured body composition by bioimpedance and waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, glucose, and insulin with standard methods. We constructed a standardized continuously distributed variable for clustered risk.   RESULTS Total body movement (counts . day(-1)) was significantly and independently associated with three of six risk factors (fasting triglycerides, insulin, and HDL) and with clustered metabolic risk (P = 0.004) after adjustment for age, sex, and obesity. Time spent at moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity (MPVA) was independently associated with clustered metabolic risk (P = 0.03). Five- and 10-min bouts of MVPA, time spent sedentary, time spent at light-intensity activity, and aerobic fitness were not significantly related with clustered risk after adjustment for confounding factors.   CONCLUSIONS Total body movement is associated with intermediary phenotypic risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic disease and with clustered metabolic risk independent of aerobic fitness and obesity. Increasing the total amount of physical activity in sedentary and overweight individuals may have beneficial effects on metabolic risk factors.","Inconsistent conclusions across studies might amongst other reasons arrive from unreliable measurements of SED, as most of these studies have included !3-5 days of measurement [12][13][14]#AUTHOR_TAG[16][17], with some exceptions (!1 day [18]; !6-7 days [19,20]).","['In adults, !3-5 days of monitoring are normally considered appropriate, which is in accordance with recommendations given [2].', 'However, estimates of how many days of monitoring that should be included to obtain a reliable result vary considerably between studies [3-7, 2, 8], and might also vary between outcome variables of interest [6,8].', 'According to Matthews et al [6], inclusion of more days may be needed to arrive at reliable estimates (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) !0.80) for ""physical inactivity"" (<500 cpm from the Actigraph 7164) (!7 days), compared to PA (! 3-4 days).', 'A comparable finding has been shown in older adults, where 2-3 days was needed for PA, whereas 5 days of monitoring was needed for SED (<50 cpm from the Actigraph 7164).', 'The possible impaired reliability for SED compared to other variables may be of critical importance, given the increased interest in SED in the primary and secondary prevention of a range of chronic diseases as well as premature death [9][10][11].', 'Inconsistent conclusions across studies might amongst other reasons arrive from unreliable measurements of SED, as most of these studies have included !3-5 days of measurement [12][13][14]#AUTHOR_TAG[16][17], with some exceptions (!1 day [18]; !6-7 days [19,20]).', 'Moreover, as SED are likely to be related to wear time, correction for wear time might improve reliability.', 'Consistent with this hypothesis, percent SED has previously been shown to be superior to minutes of SED as a predictor of metabolic risk [18].']",0,"['Inconsistent conclusions across studies might amongst other reasons arrive from unreliable measurements of SED, as most of these studies have included !3-5 days of measurement [12][13][14]#AUTHOR_TAG[16][17], with some exceptions (!1 day [18]; !6-7 days [19,20]).']"

WICKEL"", ""GREGORY J. WELK""]","Relative and absolute decisions in physical activity research are commonly based on a single assessment period that may not represent habitual activity behavior. This study used the generalizability theory to 1) quantify multiple sources of measurement error and 2) estimate the number of days and seasons needed to characterize long-term levels of activity.Between 2005 and 2006, youth participating in an intervention program were asked to wear a pedometer across seven consecutive days during three separate months (September, January, and May). Total variance in activity was partitioned and quantified according to differences among participants, inconsistency across days, relative differences among seasons, and the interactions among variables. Two coefficients (generalizability and phi) were calculated from multiple decision studies using a random and mixed design to determine the study protocol needed to achieve a reliability of 0.80 for relative and absolute decisions, respectively. Data were analyzed in 2009.Complete data were available for 42 boys and 38 girls. Residual variance accounted for the largest source of measurement error (55.64%), whereas smaller amounts were attributed to the participant (18.74%), season (6.59%), and day (2.67%) terms. Using a random design, both coefficients failed to reach an acceptable level of reliability using a single season. In contrast, using a mixed design, an acceptable level of reliability could be reached using 7-8 d from a single, fixed season.This study demonstrates the potential for using the generalizability theory to make decisions regarding the rank order of activity among individuals (relative decision) and compliance rates for physical activity recommendations (absolute decision).","However, such study designs have received critique for possibly leaving to optimistic results and should be interpreted with caution [23][24]#AUTHOR_TAG.","['Historically, sedentary behavior (SED) was conceptualized as the lower end of the PA spectrum, as opposed to moderate-to vigorous PA (MVPA), but is now increasingly being viewed as a behavior distinct from PA, defined as waking behavior characterized by an energy expenditure 1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) [21].', 'Although somewhat arbitrary, studies using Actigraph instruments mainly operationalize SED as the time spent <100 cpm.', 'This cutoff differs substantially from that used to define ""inactivity"" (<500 cpm) applied by Matthews et al [6].', 'Thus, besides the study of reliability of SED in older adults [8], to the best of our knowledge, reliability of SED obtained by accelerometry have not been investigated in adults, and should be prioritized [22].', 'Furthermore, no studies have determined the intra-individual week-by-week agreement of accelerometer outcomes using absolute measures of reliability (i.e., standard error of the measurement and limits of agreement).', 'Most evidence suggest that a reliability of !0.70-0.80 are achieved for PA with 3-7 days of monitoring by estimation of the number of days needed based on the Spearman Brown prophecy formula, when measurements are conducted over a single 7-day period [5-7, 2, 8].', 'However, such study designs have received critique for possibly leaving to optimistic results and should be interpreted with caution [23][24]#AUTHOR_TAG.', 'First, the results are in principle only generalizable to the included days, as inclusion of additional days, weeks or seasons will add variability.', 'Secondly, the assumption of compound symmetry (i.e., similar variances and co-variances) across days of measurement might not be fulfilled.', 'Additionally, ICC is the variance partitioning of subjects to the total variance, thus ICC is a relative and context-specific estimate that depends on the heterogeneity of the sample [26][27][28].', 'Thus, research targeting agreement of SED and PA measurements by means of absolute measures of reliability, which allow for a direct quantification of how much outcomes vary over time independent of the variability of observations should be given priority.']",2,"['However, such study designs have received critique for possibly leaving to optimistic results and should be interpreted with caution [23][24]#AUTHOR_TAG.']"

Biddle""]","Background: In recent years there has been a growing interest in the relationship between sedentary behaviour (sitting) and health outcomes. Only recently have there been studies assessing the association between time spent in sedentary behaviour and the metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study is to quantify the association between sedentary behaviour and the metabolic syndrome in adults using meta-analysis. Methodology/Principal Findings: Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched using medical subject headings and key words related to sedentary behaviours and the metabolic syndrome. Reference lists of relevant articles and personal databases were hand searched. Inclusion criteria were: (1) cross sectional or prospective design; (2) include adults &ge;18 years of age; (3) self-reported or objectively measured sedentary time; and (4) an outcome measure of metabolic syndrome. Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals for metabolic syndrome comparing the highest level of sedentary behaviour to the lowest were extracted for each study. Data were pooled using random effects models to take into account heterogeneity between studies. Ten cross-sectional studies (n = 21393 participants), one high, four moderate and five poor quality, were identified. Greater time spent sedentary increased the odds of metabolic syndrome by 73% (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.55-1.94, p&lt;0.0001). There were no differences for subgroups of sex, sedentary behaviour measure, metabolic syndrome definition, study quality or country income. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.61) or publication bias (Eggers test t = 1.05, p = 0.32). Conclusions: People who spend higher amounts of time in sedentary behaviours have greater odds of having metabolic syndrome.

Historically, seden-tary behaviour was conceptualized as one end of the physical activity spectrum but is increasingly being viewed as a behaviour distinct from physical activity. Methods Prospective studies examining the associations between screen time (watching television, watching videos and using a computer) and sitting time and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) were identified. These prospective studies relied on self-reported sedentary behaviour. Results The majority of prospective studies of screen time and sitting time has shown that greater sedentary time is associated with an increased risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD. Compared with the lowest levels of sedentary time, risk estimates ranged up to 1.68 for the highest level of sitting time and 2.25 for the highest level of screen time after adjustment for a series of covariates, including measures of physical activity. For six studies of screen time and CVD, the summary hazard ratio per 2-h increase was 1.17 (95% CI: 1.13-1.20). For two studies of sitting time, the summary hazard ratio per 2-h increase was 1.05 (95 % CI: 1.01-1.09). Conclusions Future prospective studies using more objective measures of seden-tary behaviour might prove helpful in quantifying better the risk between sedentary behaviour and CVD morbidity and mortality.

METHODS For each participant, we determined the daily minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA), and minutes of MVPA that occurred in bouts of 10 min. Participants were then categorized into patterns of activity, using LCA and adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics.   RESULTS For overall MVPA, five classes of physical activity were defined, including two least active classes, which averaged less than 25 min of MVPA per day and represented 78.7% of the total study population. The most active class averaged 134 min of MVPA per day and comprised 0.9% of the population. The results for bout minutes of MVPA were similar to the patterns produced for overall MVPA, with the exception of a ""weekend warrior"" class with moderate levels of physical activity Monday through Friday but with a much higher level of activity on the weekend, particularly on Sunday. This class represented 1.8% of the population. Only 1.4% of all days achieved 10 min or more of VPA, and in 91.1% of all days, participants accumulated less than 1 min of VPA. The LCA analysis of VPA did not produce stable results, because of the small number of participants registering any minutes of VPA.   CONCLUSION Our results indicate that a very large portion of the U.S. population may be classified into patterns of physical activity that represent low levels of MVPA throughout the week. The LCA analysis provided a novel approach for assessing patterns of objectively measured physical activity in epidemiologic studies.","Results were initially reported for overall PA level (CPM), as well as SED (<100 cpm), light PA (LPA) (100-2019 cpm), MPA (2020-5998 cpm), VPA (!5999 cpm) and MVPA (!2020 cpm) obtained from the vertical axis (axis 1) #AUTHOR_TAG, as well as the vector magnitude (VM) CPM.","['Results were initially reported for overall PA level (CPM), as well as SED (<100 cpm), light PA (LPA) (100-2019 cpm), MPA (2020-5998 cpm), VPA (!5999 cpm) and MVPA (!2020 cpm) obtained from the vertical axis (axis 1) #AUTHOR_TAG, as well as the vector magnitude (VM) CPM.', 'However, as the level of VPA were very low (median (interquartile range) 1.3 (9.0) min/day), MPA and VPA were collapsed and only MVPA were reported throughout the study.', 'Intensityspecific PA and SED were reported as minutes/day and as percentage values of daily valid wear time.']",0,"['Results were initially reported for overall PA level (CPM), as well as SED (<100 cpm), light PA (LPA) (100-2019 cpm), MPA (2020-5998 cpm), VPA (!5999 cpm) and MVPA (!2020 cpm) obtained from the vertical axis (axis 1) #AUTHOR_TAG, as well as the vector magnitude (VM) CPM.']"

Caloric intake, movement recorders (accelerometers and pedometers), and heart rate were the measurements studied in 30 subjects who were monitored during their waking hours for 7 continuous days. A repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant difference between days (P > 0.05) for any of the measures when only weekdays were compared. However, when weekend days were included a majority of the measures showed a significant F-ratio (P < 0.05). An estimate was made of the number of days required to measure a 7-d period with less than 5% error. The average for all the different measures was 4.9 d. It appears that at least 5 or 6 d are needed to minimize the intra-individual variance a reasonable degree.

We conducted a cross-sectional population-based multicenter study to describe the levels of PA and sedentary activity and to determine adherence to current national PA recommendations in Norwegian adults and older people. Methods: In 2008 and 2009, PA was assessed objectively for seven consecutive days using the ActiGraph GT1M accelerometer in 3867 participants age 20-85 yr. A total of 3267 participants provided valid PA assessments that met all inclusion criteria. Results: Women and men did not differ in the overall activity levels (335 and 342 counts per minute, respectively) or in steps per day (8113 and 7951 steps per day, respectively). However, for intensity-specific PA, men accumulated significantly more minutes of sedentary activity and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) compared with women (557 vs 533 min of sedentary activity, P ² 0.001 and 35 vs 33 min of MVPA, P = 0.01). Both overall activity levels and steps per day remained steady with age, until 65 yr, after which activity levels declined. Conclusions: Overall, the study sample spent 62% of their time being sedentary, 25% in low-intensity PA, 9% in lifestyle activity, and 4% in MVPA. One in five people met current national PA recommendations. These results suggest that adults and older people spend the majority of their time being sedentary and that adherence to PA recommendations is low.",The current sample was a convenience sample exhibiting a higher activity level (but with approximately similar heterogeneity as evaluated by SDs for the different outcome variables) as compared to population estimates for the corresponding age group #AUTHOR_TAG[35][36].,"['The present estimates of number of days needed to achieve a reliability of ICC = 0.80 for overall PA and MVPA, fall in between of previous estimates.', 'While several studies have found that 2-6 days are required [5,7,8,6,30], other studies have shown that 12 [4] and 16-23 days are needed [3].', 'Jerome et al [3] used a wear time criteria of !6 h, which might have led to the need for many days of measurement, in line with the trend across the wear time criteria applied in the present study.', 'Levin et al [4] applied a protocol with measurements during an entire year, which may have introduced greater variation (e.g., seasonal effects) than across subsequent days and weeks.', 'Nevertheless, as ICC is based on variance partitioning and depends on the relative difference in variances (inter-vs.', 'intra-individual sources of variance), the coefficient is context-specific.', 'Thus, it change with the range of observations (similar to the correlation coefficient), despite residual variance and absolute measures of reliability being unaffected [26][27][28].', 'The current sample was a convenience sample exhibiting a higher activity level (but with approximately similar heterogeneity as evaluated by SDs for the different outcome variables) as compared to population estimates for the corresponding age group #AUTHOR_TAG[35][36].', 'Thus, it could be argued that our estimates of ICC might be fairly generalizable to the general adult population.', 'Yet, previous studies have concluded that it does not seem to be any relationship between activity level and reliability [6,4].', 'Based on the heteroscedastic patterns of variability found for overall PA level and MVPA (Fig 1), the current study indicates otherwise.', 'Thus, the sample characteristics (exhibiting a high PA level) might be a likely explanation for the lower reliability found for PA compared to other studies.', 'This means that researchers should determine reliability in their specific samples to make appropriate decisions on valid wear criteria in a given study.', 'Yet, it could be hypothesized from the current study that SED are less influenced by sample characteristics than PA, as a homoscedastic pattern was evident for SED as opposed to the heteroscedastic pattern found for PA.']",0,['The current sample was a convenience sample exhibiting a higher activity level (but with approximately similar heterogeneity as evaluated by SDs for the different outcome variables) as compared to population estimates for the corresponding age group #AUTHOR_TAG[35][36].']

Data are described from 6329 participants who provided at least 1 d of accelerometer data and from 4867 participants who provided four or more days of accelerometer data. Results: Males are more physically active than females. Physical activity declines dramatically across age groups between childhood and adolescence and continues to decline with age. For example, 42% of children ages 6-11 yr obtain the recommended 60 min x d(-1) of physical activity, whereas only 8% of adolescents achieve this goal. Among adults, adherence to the recommendation to obtain 30 min x d(-1) of physical activity is less than 5%. Conclusions: Objective and subjective measures of physical activity give qualitatively similar results regarding gender and age patterns of activity. However, adherence to physical activity recommendations according to accelerometer-measured activity is substantially lower than according to self-report.

DATA SOURCE AND METHODS Exploratory analyses were conducted on an unweighted subsample (n=987) of the accelerometry data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey. Participants were asked to wear an accelerometer for 7 consecutive days. Calibration, reliability, biological plausibility and compliance issues were explored using descriptive statistics.   RESULTS Ongoing calibration is an effective method for identifying malfunctioning accelerometers. The percentage of files deemed viable for analysis depends on participant compliance, the allowable interruption period chosen and the minimum wear-time-per-day criterion. A 60-minute allowable interruption period and 10-hours-per-day wear time criteria resulted in 95% of the subsample having at least 1 valid day, and 84% having at least 4 valid days.   INTERPRETATION Before the derivation of physical activity outcomes, accelerometry data should undergo standardized quality control and data reduction procedures to prevent mis-representation of the results. Incomplete accelerometry data should be handled carefully, and strategies to improve compliance in the field are warranted.","However, the number of observations left for analyses declined with increased wear time criteria, as shown previously #AUTHOR_TAG.","['Nevertheless, our findings suggest that 6-9 days of measurement might be needed to reliably capture SED and PA, given a wear time criteria of 10-12 h/day.', 'This necessitates an increased monitoring length, compared to that of 7 days that is usually applied.', 'Although this might improve validity of study conclusions, the burden for subjects should be kept minimal to maximize response rate and adherence to the monitoring protocol.', 'Feedback from our subjects clearly indicated that 21 days of monitoring was a lengthy measurement.', 'However, 14 days would be appropriate, under the assumption that subjects obtain 4-5 valid days per week.', 'Still, this is a matter of the research question posed, as population-estimates on a group level requires less reliability than individual-level estimates.', 'Also, an increased wear time per day is an option.', 'However, the number of observations left for analyses declined with increased wear time criteria, as shown previously #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Thus, the choice of wear time criteria is a trade-off between reliability and power, of which both are of crucial importance to arrive at valid conclusions, as the loss of both will bias conclusions towards the null-hypothesis.', 'As noise in predictor (x-) variables will lead to attenuation of regression coefficients by biasing coefficients towards the null (regression dilution bias), and noise in outcome (y-) variables will increase standard errors and increase the likelihood of performing type II errors [1], unreliable measures will weaken researchers ability to make valid conclusions in PA epidemiology.', 'If PA is modeled as an exposure variable, increased sample size on the expense of reliability will only make the results more precisely wrong [1].']",0,"['Nevertheless, our findings suggest that 6-9 days of measurement might be needed to reliably capture SED and PA, given a wear time criteria of 10-12 h/day.', 'However, the number of observations left for analyses declined with increased wear time criteria, as shown previously #AUTHOR_TAG.']"

To allow the inversion of the covariance operator we make the assumption that the dependency between the component functions lies in a finite-dimensional subspace. In this subspace we define fourth cross-cumulant operators and use them to construct the two novel, Fisher consistent methods for solving the independent component problem for vector-valued functions.

Specifically, this model explains how top management mediates the impact of external institutional pressures on the degree of usage of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. The hypotheses were tested using survey data from companies that have already implemented ERP systems. Results from partial least squares (PLS) analyses suggest that mimetic pressures positively affect top management beliefs, which then positively affects top management participation in the ERP assimilation process. In turn, top management participation is confirmed to positively affect the degree of ERP usage. Results also suggest that coercive pressures positively affect top management participation without the mediation of top management beliefs.

Gattiker"", ""Craig R. Carter""]","Abstract A key enabler of environmental projects is the ability of the project champion to gain commitment to the project from other stakeholders in his or her organization. This paper develops a model of commitment-gaining success that is based on intra-organizational influence theory. The model also includes project payback, customer pressure, government regulation, top management support and the project champion's position in the organizational hierarchy. The model was tested using survey data from 241 environmental professionals describing their attempts to gain the buy-in of purchasing managers, operations managers, industrial engineers and others for environmental projects. The results (obtained from hierarchical regression analysis) show that intra-organizational commitment is positively associated with the project champion's influence behavior--in particular, the champion's use of three influence tactics (inspirational appeals, consultation and rational persuasion) and avoidance of a fourth tactic (ingratiation). Commitment is also positively associated with project payback and with top management support for the environment and negatively associated with environmental regulation. The paper contributes to the OM knowledge base on environmental project implementation by bringing new theory to bear on the topic, by focusing on individual-level, rather than organization-level, variables and by taking a confirmatory, large sample approach which complements extant exploratory research. In addition, the paper contributes to the OM field by evaluating various antecedents to cross-functional integration. The results also provide specific guidance to those who champion environmental projects within their companies.","Top management commitment (TMC)-Top management commitment is vital to organizations and supply chain partners aiming to implement green and sustainable practices (Liang et al., 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG and Carter, 2010;Foerstl et al., 2015).","['Top management commitment (TMC)-Top management commitment is vital to organizations and supply chain partners aiming to implement green and sustainable practices (Liang et al., 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG and Carter, 2010;Foerstl et al., 2015).', 'The importance of top management beliefs, practices, and commitment has been hence highlighted in the literature (Abdulrahman et al., 2014;Bag and Anand, 2014;Jabbour and Jabbour, in press).', 'Hence, without support from higher management it is impossible to make use of cleaner and greener resources in the supply chain.', 'Management should be proactive rather than reactive in going green in every aspect possible.', 'Recent research supports our assumption that top management commitment is an important enabler (Deif, 2011;Despeisse et al., 2012;Law and Gunasekaran, 2012;Singh et al., 2012;Dues et al., 2013;van Hoof and Lyon, 2013;Dubey et al., 2015).']",5,"['Top management commitment (TMC)-Top management commitment is vital to organizations and supply chain partners aiming to implement green and sustainable practices (Liang et al., 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG and Carter, 2010;Foerstl et al., 2015).']"

And whether the CER collaborations could improve the performance of participants is another focus of our study. This paper provides a questionnaire survey about CER inter-firm collaborations on energy intensive industries in China. Three regression models including Multiple Linear Regression, Binary Choice Model, and Ordinal Choice Regression are employed to identify the determinants that drive or impede the implementation of CER collaborations. The results show that inter-firm CER collaborations are generally at an infancy stage in China. The main driver for CER collaborations derives from the CER demands of other stakeholders in the industrial chains. And the lack of infrastructure and mechanism is the main barrier that impedes the inter-firm collaborations. Moreover, CER collaborations through industrial symbiosis play a positive role in improving economic performance. However, the effects are to a large extent related to the improved environmental performance through the CER collaborations.

We use structural equation modeling for testing our research hypotheses on a large sample of Italian firms, and estimate the structural paths between constructs by means of both covariance- and component-based approaches. The use of both estimation methods allows us contributing to the recent debate about the specification of the ""performance"" construct as an emerging rather than as a latent variable, and then using formative rather than reflective indicators. Formative indicators are used whenever a construct does not exist without its measures, any change in one of the indicators causes a change in the construct, and the measures are ingredients of the construct rather than being caused by it. For instance, economic performance is an emerging construct since economic measures (e.g., profits and market share) contribute to forming the construct rather than reflecting the behavior of the latent variable. We show that the correct model specification changes the estimates of the path coefficients and leads to research findings aligned to the literature. Our results indicate that being green internally is a prerequisite for collaboration into a green supply chain, internal EM contributes to increasing performance more than external EM, while performing the environment does not lead to a higher economic performance.","Bell et al., 2012;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2012;Hollos et al., 2012;de Jong, 2011 andAwaysheh andKlassen, 2010), looking at, for instance, the effect of internal or external environmental practices on the triple bottom line (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2012) and economic performance (Giovanni and Vinzi, 2012) or the role of supplier collaboration in sustainable performance (Hollos et al., 2012).","['There is growing trend among the companies to link green practices with their corporate strategies (see Gallear, 2012 andSarkis et al., 2011).', 'Green manufacturing, or more precisely the green supply chain, has attracted interest among management researchers, environmentalists and practitioners in the last decade (Gunasekaran social and environmental measures in their models (e.g.', 'Bell et al., 2012;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2012;Hollos et al., 2012;de Jong, 2011 andAwaysheh andKlassen, 2010), looking at, for instance, the effect of internal or external environmental practices on the triple bottom line (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2012) and economic performance (Giovanni and Vinzi, 2012) or the role of supplier collaboration in sustainable performance (Hollos et al., 2012).']",4,"['Bell et al., 2012;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2012;Hollos et al., 2012;de Jong, 2011 andAwaysheh andKlassen, 2010), looking at, for instance, the effect of internal or external environmental practices on the triple bottom line (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2012) and economic performance (Giovanni and Vinzi, 2012) or the role of supplier collaboration in sustainable performance (Hollos et al., 2012).']"

While the literature has concentrated on why downstream original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and retailers become ""sustainable,"" much less is known regarding why and how upstream suppliers implement sustainability practices. Based on findings from a cross-case analysis of eight first-tier (FT) suppliers and an integration of resource dependency theory (RDT), this study explores the drivers and mechanisms of FT supplier engagement in sustainable supply chain management. Suppliers need to understand the sustainability priorities of customers and stakeholders to derive the effective focus and depth of further upstream integration with subsuppliers. Therefore, the integration between the two functions that manage the relevant external interfaces, namely marketing (downstream and stakeholder communication) and procurement (upstream), appears to be the essential cornerstone to move beyond FT supplier compliance to actual commitment to sustainability practices. We present findings on how (1) stakeholder-related, (2) process-related, and (3) product-related drivers influence the choice and effectiveness of the procurement-marketing integration (PM integration) mechanisms. Stakeholder pressures are considered to be the principal drivers of sustainability efforts. However, on their own, they rarely provide sufficient grounds for permanent and embedded PM integration initiatives at FT suppliers. Evidence suggests that suppliers' commitment to PM integration is motivated by the opportunity to leverage sustainability initiatives in their product offerings and sustainability certificates recognizable by customers and secondary stakeholders.","Top management commitment (TMC)-Top management commitment is vital to organizations and supply chain partners aiming to implement green and sustainable practices (Liang et al., 2007;Gattiker and Carter, 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2015).","['Top management commitment (TMC)-Top management commitment is vital to organizations and supply chain partners aiming to implement green and sustainable practices (Liang et al., 2007;Gattiker and Carter, 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2015).', 'The importance of top management beliefs, practices, and commitment has been hence highlighted in the literature (Abdulrahman et al., 2014;Bag and Anand, 2014;Jabbour and Jabbour, in press).', 'Hence, without support from higher management it is impossible to make use of cleaner and greener resources in the supply chain.', 'Management should be proactive rather than reactive in going green in every aspect possible.', 'Recent research supports our assumption that top management commitment is an important enabler (Deif, 2011;Despeisse et al., 2012;Law and Gunasekaran, 2012;Singh et al., 2012;Dues et al., 2013;van Hoof and Lyon, 2013;Dubey et al., 2015).']",5,"['Top management commitment (TMC)-Top management commitment is vital to organizations and supply chain partners aiming to implement green and sustainable practices (Liang et al., 2007;Gattiker and Carter, 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2015).']"

The researcher both maps and assesses the relevant intellectual territory in order to specify a research question which will further develop the knowledge hase. However, traditional 'narrative' reviews frequently lack thoroughness, and in many cases are not undertaken as genuine pieces of investigatory science. Consequently they can lack a means for making sense of what the collection of studies is saying. These reviews can he hiased by the researcher and often lack rigour. Furthermore, the use of reviews of the available evidence to provide insights and guidance for intervention into operational needs of practitioners and policymakers has largely been of secondary importance. For practitioners, making sense of a mass of often-contrad ictory evidence has hecome progressively harder. The quality of evidence underpinning decision-making and action has heen questioned, for inadequate or incomplete evidence seriously impedes policy formulation and implementation. In exploring ways in which evidence-informed management reviews might be achieved, the authors evaluate the process of systematic review used in the medical sciences. Over the last fifteen years, medical science has attempted to improve the review process hy synthesizing research in a systematic, transparent, and reproducihie manner with the twin aims of enhancing the knowledge hase and informing policymaking and practice. This paper evaluates the extent to which the process of systematic review can be applied to the management field in order to produce a reliable knowledge stock and enhanced practice by developing context-sensitive research.

Among the three pillars of sustainability consisting of environmental, social and economic longevity and foresight of a firm, we focus on the environmental component. Specifically, basing our arguments on the resource-based view of the firm, we hypothesize the impact of environmental management on plant performance. Environmental initiatives considered include ISO 14000 certification, pollution prevention, recycling of materials, and waste reduction; plant performance is assessed with the dimensions of the four competitive capabilities of quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost. Further, building on the theory of performance frontiers, we investigate these relationships across plants located in different economic regions of the world (plants are classified into emerging, developing and industrialized regions). We suggest that recent emphasis on these environmental initiatives has been greatest among plants located in emerging economies, compared to their counterparts in industrialized and developing nations. In addition, we contend that the influence of these initiatives is greatest for plants located in emerging and developing economies when compared to plants in industrialized nations. These notions are tested with data collected from 1211 plants located in these three economic regions.

In a real sense however, the benefits of RL implementation is not yet fully realized in the emerging economies. This paper proposes a theoretical RL implementation model and empirically identifies significant RL barriers with respect to management, financial, policy and infrastructure in the Chinese manufacturing industries such as automotive, electrical and electronic, plastics, steel/construction, textiles and paper and paper based products. Key barriers from our study, with respect to these four categories, are: within management category a lack of reverse logistics experts and low commitment, within financial category a lack of initial capital and funds for return monitoring systems, within policy category a lack of enforceable laws and government supportive economic policies and, finally, within infrastructure category a the lack of systems for return monitoring. Contingency effect of ownership was carried out to understand the similarities and differences in RL barriers among the multinational firms and domestic firms investigated","The importance of top management beliefs, practices, and commitment has been hence highlighted in the literature (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014;Bag and Anand, 2014;Jabbour and Jabbour, in press).","['Top management commitment (TMC)-Top management commitment is vital to organizations and supply chain partners aiming to implement green and sustainable practices (Liang et al., 2007;Gattiker and Carter, 2010;Foerstl et al., 2015).', 'The importance of top management beliefs, practices, and commitment has been hence highlighted in the literature (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014;Bag and Anand, 2014;Jabbour and Jabbour, in press).', 'Hence, without support from higher management it is impossible to make use of cleaner and greener resources in the supply chain.', 'Management should be proactive rather than reactive in going green in every aspect possible.', 'Recent research supports our assumption that top management commitment is an important enabler (Deif, 2011;Despeisse et al., 2012;Law and Gunasekaran, 2012;Singh et al., 2012;Dues et al., 2013;van Hoof and Lyon, 2013;Dubey et al., 2015).']",0,"['Top management commitment (TMC)-Top management commitment is vital to organizations and supply chain partners aiming to implement green and sustainable practices (Liang et al., 2007;Gattiker and Carter, 2010;Foerstl et al., 2015).', 'The importance of top management beliefs, practices, and commitment has been hence highlighted in the literature (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014;Bag and Anand, 2014;Jabbour and Jabbour, in press).', 'Hence, without support from higher management it is impossible to make use of cleaner and greener resources in the supply chain.']"

Mathiyazhagan"", ""Kannan Govindan"", ""A. NoorulHaq"", ""Yong Geng""]","As customers are becoming more environmental conscious and governments are making stricter environmental regulations, the industries need to reduce the environmental impact of their supply chain. Indian auto component manufacturing industries especially SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) are focused to cleaner production by implementing Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) in their industries. But they are struggling to implement GSCM concept. The present research analyzes the barriers for the implementation of GSCM concept which has been divided into two phases such as identification of barriers and qualitative analysis. The study has used three different research phases: identification of barriers from the literature, interviews with various department managers and a survey of auto component manufacturing industries. The identification phase led to the selection of twenty-six barriers based on literature and in consultation with industrial experts and academicians. The Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) qualitative analysis was used to understand the mutual influences amongst the twenty-six barriers by survey. This study seeks to identify which barrier is acting as the most dominant one for the adoption of green supply chain management and this result is helpful for industries to make easier the adoption of green concept in their supply chain by removing the dominant barrier. It indicates that different Indian auto component manufacturing industries have differing barriers for the implementation of green supply chain management. However, in their GSCM implementation, especially for maintaining the environmental awareness, the supplier barrier is the dominant one. Finally the approach has been applied to ten auto components manufacturing industries in Tamilnadu, South India.","There is a rich body of literature on enablers of GSCM implementation and their interrelationships (Ali and Govindan, 2011;Large and Thomsen, 2011;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013) highlighting the role of GSCM in achieving sustainability Hsu et al.

We employ input-output data as well as data from a company survey to give a comprehensive picture of servitization across countries and industries.  The share of services in the output of manufacturing industries increased in the large majority of European countries between 1995 and 2005 and between 2000 and 2005. Service output of manu-facturing, however, is still small compared to the output of physical products. The highest service shares are found in small countries with a high degree of openness and R&D intensity. EU-12 Member States have lower shares of service output compared to the EU-15.  There is a strong link between servitization and technological innovation at different levels. Countries with the highest shares of services on manufacturing output have also the highest R&D intensities at the aggregate level. The service output of these countries consists predominantly of knowledge-intensive services. Highly innovative sectors reveal also the highest share of firms that offer services and the highest turnover generated with services. Examples are electrical and optical equipment, machinery, or the chemical and pharmaceutical industry.   At the firm level, we find a U-shaped relationship between firm size and service output, which indicates that small, but also large manufacturing firms have advantages in servitization. Producers of complex, customized products tend to have a higher share of services in output than producers of simple, mass-produced goods. Moreover, firms which have launched products new to the market during the last two years are more likely to realize higher shares of turnover from services compared to companies which launched no products new to the market.","SLR is a quite popular methodology in medical science, however in recent years it has seen significant growth in management fields (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013), to synthesize and organize research findings from multiple studies.","['We conducted our systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the key enablers of GSCM and their interrelationships, following the principles set out by Tranfield et al.

CC857,74390377,Green Supply Chain Management Enablers: Mixed Methods Research,Rameshwar Dubey,Performance measurement of supplier relationships Supply Chain Management,"[""Mihalis Giannakis""]","Purpose Ð The purpose of this paper is to develop an analytical model for assessing the performance of supplier relationships (SRs). The majority of performance measurement models incorporate hard quantitative measures that are not appropriate for the soft features of business relationships. As they are usually designed by the customer organisation, they are imposed on suppliers, they do not take into account the relationship as a unit of analysis and therefore they carry a bias in their interpretation. Design/methodology/approach Ð For the development of the model, the nature of a SR is conceptualised in terms of two typologies: one based on the level of its analysis and one based on its genesis and development and the methodology of gap analysis is used. Findings Ð The performance of SRs is assessed in terms of several disparities that exist between the participating parties' perceptions of the nature and their performance to the relationship as well as their perception of their partners' performance to the relationship. The proposed model can be utilised with qualitative (interviews) as well as quantitative (survey) data. The aim of any improvement strategy for the performance of SRs should be to minimise the gaps in partners' perceptions and pursuit the role that the parties play in the relationship and identify those factors that have greater importance to the relationship. Appropriate strategies should be then selected to minimise the gaps in the perceptions of the individuals against these factors. Research limitations/implications Ð The usefulness of the model in assessing SRs' performance lies in the fact that a holistic view of SRs is achieved by taking into account both soft and hard dimensions of SRs. Contrasting the model to other performance management models its major limitation is that it cannot be used as a ÒscientificÓ diagnostic tool for suggestion of best practices. Further research is required to identify the causes behind poor performance in a particular area and then devise appropriate strategies. Practical implications Ð The proposed model can be used in different context (manufacturing or services), does not require specialised knowledge or external consulting and provides scope for improvement of relationships between departments within an organisation. Originality/value Ð This paper emphasises the importance of performance measurement of SRs and proposes an innovative for performance measurement model, which overcomes the limitations of existing tools and can be applied in several contexts.","Firms that engage in establishing strong relationships with suppliers enjoy superior performance (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007;Reuter et al., 2010;Gimenez and Tachizawa, 2012;Burritt and Schaltegger, 2012).","['Our hypotheses were all supported; in particular our study highlights the importance of institutional pressures Schroeder, 2004, Ketchen andHult, 2007;Liu et al., 2010;Sarkis et al., 2011;Bhakoo and Choi, 2013;Kauppi, 2013;Dubey et al., 2014) and top management commitment (Liang et al., 2007;Gattiker and Carter, 2010;Foerstl et al., 2015;Jabbour and Jabbour, in press) in the management of both suppliers and customers within the context of GSCM.', 'Firms that engage in establishing strong relationships with suppliers enjoy superior performance (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007;Reuter et al., 2010;Gimenez and Tachizawa, 2012;Burritt and Schaltegger, 2012).', 'In our study, we did not show that CRM and SRM are directly influencing performance (either environmental or financial) but that they enable GTA and TQM and then influence environmental and financial performance.', 'Furthermore, we extended those studies illustrating the role of TMC in mediating the relationships between institutional pressures and intention to adopt best sustainability practices, in that we showed that TMC mediates the relationship between institutional pressures (either external or internal) and customer relationship management.', ""Hence TMC may 'translate' different pressures into initiatives with target particular customers and aim to maintain relationship with them."", 'In this vein, our study highlights the role of developing appropriate strategies that translate pressures into management and foster collaboration with suppliers and customers (Hsu and Hu, 2009;Ku et al., 2010;Hoejmose et al., 2012;Shaw et al., 2012;Caniels et al., 2013;Govindan et al., 2013;Zhu and Geng, 2013).']",5,"['Firms that engage in establishing strong relationships with suppliers enjoy superior performance (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007;Reuter et al., 2010;Gimenez and Tachizawa, 2012;Burritt and Schaltegger, 2012).']"

Volumes of methodological texts are matched with a massive amount of empirical research that seeks to apply and further develop case research as a scientific method. What is missing from this literature is a treatment of the methodological diversity of case research. In this paper, we seek to unveil this heterogeneity by describing three distinct methodological accounts of case study: theory generation, theory testing, and theory elaboration. Each approach has its own idiosyncrasies, in particular when it comes to the interplay between theory and empirics. A typical case research incorporates both existing theories and empirical data to varying degrees. In light of this heterogeneity, we re-interpret key aspects of extant contributions and discuss guidelines for future case research. We propose that ultimately, case research rigor is determined by attention to idiosyncrasy and transparency of reasoning. We conclude by arguing that we have witnessed in the past 25 years in organization research what amounts to the Renaissance of case research.","In recent years the use of the case study approach has attracted interest in the operations and supply chain management community (#AUTHOR_TAG and Choi, 2014).","['In recent years the use of the case study approach has attracted interest in the operations and supply chain management community (#AUTHOR_TAG and Choi, 2014).', 'Pagell and Wu (2009) have used 10 cases to build comprehensive theory.', 'However, in spite of their merits, case studies have significant demerits as identified by Meredith (1998).', 'Scholars have criticized the case study research approach on the grounds of ""ambiguity of inferred hypotheses"" and the ""selective bias"" (Bitektine, 2008: 161;Barratt et al., 2011), and in that there is risk that the researcher would look for data that fits hypotheses stated a priori (Barratt et al., 2011).', 'These criticisms have stemmed mainly from scholars who are not familiar with qualitative methods (Bitektine, 2008;Roth, 2007).', 'However, rather than continuing the never-ending debate between quantitative or qualitative research, in this paper we argue for the use of mixed-method research which may employ both qualitative and quantitative methods in order to build theory, in the context of GSCM, driven by the endorsement of scholars to build robust methodological approaches and techniques that consider the dynamic environment of OM and SCM (and in our case GSCM).', 'Furthermore, there is need for more studies looking at green supply chain initiatives in emerging economies, which ""is still an under-researched area"" (Hsu et al., 2013, p. 656).']",4,"['In recent years the use of the case study approach has attracted interest in the operations and supply chain management community (#AUTHOR_TAG and Choi, 2014).', 'Pagell and Wu (2009) have used 10 cases to build comprehensive theory.', 'However, in spite of their merits, case studies have significant demerits as identified by Meredith (1998).', 'Scholars have criticized the case study research approach on the grounds of ""ambiguity of inferred hypotheses"" and the ""selective bias"" (Bitektine, 2008: 161;Barratt et al., 2011), and in that there is risk that the researcher would look for data that fits hypotheses stated a priori (Barratt et al., 2011).', 'These criticisms have stemmed mainly from scholars who are not familiar with qualitative methods (Bitektine, 2008;Roth, 2007).', 'However, rather than continuing the never-ending debate between quantitative or qualitative research, in this paper we argue for the use of mixed-method research which may employ both qualitative and quantitative methods in order to build theory, in the context of GSCM, driven by the endorsement of scholars to build robust methodological approaches and techniques that consider the dynamic environment of OM and SCM (and in our case GSCM).']"

In particular, neo-institutional arguments can shed light on the determinants of manufacturing practice adoption and implementation. We juxtapose both theoretically and empirically three different theoretical perspectives that can be used to address the phenomenon: strategic contingency, structural contingency and neo-institutional arguments.

This paper presents a qualitative study that considered how clinicians constructed the role of the 'ethical' in their everyday practice. We use the concept of ethical boundary-work to develop a theory of 'settled' and 'controversial' morality to illuminate how infertility clinicians drew boundaries between different conceptions of the role ethics played in their practice. An attention to areas of settled morality, usually rendered invisible by their very nature, enables us to see how clinicians manage the 'ethical' in their practice. We argue that by creating a space of 'no-ethics' in their practice--part of a settled morality that does not require articulation--the informants re-appropriate an area of their practice from 'outside' influences and control. Bringing these elements to light can help 'outsiders' to challenge and question these distinctions and therefore bring additional perspectives to debates over morality in the infertility clinic.

The critique overlooks, however, the ways that everyday, emergent moral discourse is influenced--over time and through several mediations--by formal ethical notions. High-order ethical pronouncements become sedimented into the conditions of work, illustrated in this article by a two-year ethnographic study of Assertive Community Treatment (ACT), a popular mode of outpatient psychiatric services. ACT clinicians' moral unease when they break the confidentiality of patients is connected to high-order debates, dating back 35 years, about ensuring patients' autonomy without abandoning them. These debates originally spurred the invention of ACT, and they get braided into today's moral discourse through several mediations: regulatory paperwork, the mandates and micropolitics of staff-patient interactions, and the idealized self-image of front-line staff. This article shows how everyday moral talk is coproduced by both the immediate contexts of clinical work and the categories of formal bioethics.","As anthropologist Paul Brodwin #AUTHOR_TAG has demonstrated, for instance, professional ethics and moral discourse intertwine in US psychiatry: sedimenting within clinical work, transforming practice, and being reshaped in the process.","['From Implications to Dimensions STS, then, is useful for bioethicists to engage with on account of the fresh light it casts on the implications of new biomedical techniques and practices, but also as a consequence of the novel and under-examined issues it directs the bioethical gaze towards.', ""However, from a co-productionist perspective, STS and other work in the social sciences also illuminates that though ethical reasoning is most evidently located in discourses on the 'implications' of biomedicine, it is also a constitutive dimension of scientific and medical knowledge and practice."", 'As anthropologist Paul Brodwin #AUTHOR_TAG has demonstrated, for instance, professional ethics and moral discourse intertwine in US psychiatry: sedimenting within clinical work, transforming practice, and being reshaped in the process.', ""Recognising this ''essential entanglement of the moral and the factual'' [19: 471] is a necessary step to take in order to grapple with bioethical questions that have long been a concern to many in the field, including how scientists and clinicians ''actually solve ethical problems and make ethical decisions'' [4: 96].""]",0,"['As anthropologist Paul Brodwin #AUTHOR_TAG has demonstrated, for instance, professional ethics and moral discourse intertwine in US psychiatry: sedimenting within clinical work, transforming practice, and being reshaped in the process.']"

Because it is so prevalent and context specific, improving priority setting in a health system entails improving it in the institutions that constitute the system. But, how should this be done? Normative approaches are necessary because they help identify key values that clarify policy choices, but insufficient because different approaches lead to different conclusions and there is no consensus about which ones are correct, and they are too abstract to be directly used in actual decision making. Empirical approaches are necessary because they help to identify what is being done and what can be done, but are insufficient because they cannot identify what should be done. Moreover, to be really helpful, an improvement strategy must utilize rigorous research methods that are able to analyze and capture experience so that past problems are corrected and lessons can be shared with others. Therefore, a constructive, practical and accessible improvement strategy must be research-based and combine both normative and empirical methods. In this paper we propose a research-based improvement strategy that involves combining three linked methods: case study research to describe priority setting; interdisciplinary research to evaluate the description using an ethical framework; and action research to improve priority setting. This describe-evaluate-improve strategy is a generalizable method that can be used in different health care institutions to improve priority setting in that context.","As bioethicists Martin and Singer #AUTHOR_TAG point out, priority setting in medicine must include some form of descriptive analysis, and empirical STS research can help to create a new vantage point from which the use of resources can be viewed.","['In regards to the former, methods of visualising the interior of the body-such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-have been shown to be ascribed an authority which encourages their use even when they are costly and do not demonstrate clear therapeutic benefit [31].', 'In turn, articulations of benefit itself come to be a function of the nature of disease as mediated and understood through biomedical technique [46].', 'Such findings prompt further reflection and debate over health care rationing and resource allocation, and access to biomedical innovation.', 'As bioethicists Martin and Singer #AUTHOR_TAG point out, priority setting in medicine must include some form of descriptive analysis, and empirical STS research can help to create a new vantage point from which the use of resources can be viewed.']",0,"['As bioethicists Martin and Singer #AUTHOR_TAG point out, priority setting in medicine must include some form of descriptive analysis, and empirical STS research can help to create a new vantage point from which the use of resources can be viewed.']"

Recently, papers have begun to appear that show that a feminist analysis can be brought to bear on any subject traditional bioethics discusses. So far, however, feminist bioethics has not been brought to bear on psychiatry. There have been feminist critiques of psychiatry and feminist discussions of certain diagnostic categories that disproportionately affect women, but these are concerned with women's issues within psychiatry and how psychiatry has been used to oppress women. Certainly these are important, but what has been missing is a discussion of psychiatry in the sense that feminist bioethics suggests a general critique of psychiatry and the rethinking of the practice of psychiatry, regardless of whether the specific instances involved are women's issues.

This is not based on an assumption that non-scientists are 'ignorant' and are thus unable to 'appropriately' use or debate science; rather, it is underpinned by an empirically-grounded observation that some individuals may be unfamiliar with certain specificities of particular modes of research and ethical frameworks, and, as a consequence, have their autonomy compromised when invited to participate in biomedical investigations. Drawing on the perspectives of participants in my own sociological research on the social and ethical dimensions of neuroscience, I argue that public understanding of biomedical research and its ethics should be developed both at the community level and within the research moment itself in order to enhance autonomy and promote more socially robust science.

In this paper, we explore the dynamics of expertise and their implications for the lay-expert divide at a series of public events about the new genetics. We examine participants ' claims to expertise and consider how this relates to their claims to credibility and legitimacy and the way in which these events unfolded. Using a combination of ethnographic and discursive analysis, we found that participants supplemented technical expertise with other expert and lay perspectives. We can also link participants ' claims to expertise to their generally positive appraisal of genetic research and services. The colonization of lay positions by expert speakers and the hybrid positioning of lay-experts was characteristic of the consensus and conservatism that emerged.

Nonetheless, this body of work remains quite marginalized. I believe that there are (at least) two reasons for this. First, many people are still confused about feminism. Second, many people are unconvinced that significant sexism still exists and are therefore unreceptive to arguments that it should be remedied if there is no larger benefit. In this essay I argue for a thin, ""core"" conception of feminism that is easy to understand and difficult to reject. Core feminism would render debate within feminism more fruitful, clear the way for appropriate recognition of differences among women and their circumstances, provide intellectually compelling reasons for current non-feminists to adopt a feminist outlook, and facilitate mutually beneficial cooperation between feminism and other progressive social movements. This conception of feminism also makes it clear that feminism is part of a larger egalitarian moral and political agenda, and adopting it would help bioethics focus on the most urgent moral priorities. In addition, integrating core feminism into bioethics would open a gateway to the more speculative parts of feminist work where a wealth of creative thinking is occurring. Engaging with this feminist work would challenge and strengthen mainstream approaches: it should also motivate mainstream bioethicists to explore other currently marginalized parts of bioethics.","bioethics that it is 'too close' to science recall some internal critiques, including those from feminist bioethicists who have sought especially deep critical engagement with biomedical institutions and practices [44,59,60] and bioethical scholarship itself [42,#AUTHOR_TAG,58].","['Nevertheless, challenges remain.', 'Both STS and bioethics are highly diverse fields which lack coherent and uncontested disciplinary identities; this can make mutual understanding difficult, not least because scholars from and within each tradition may approach the same problem quite differently in terms of methods, conceptual underpinnings, and normative agenda.', ""Ironically, in cases where the same or a similar 'solution' is reached, the different routes to it that were taken could lead to professional boundary-work and institutional distance rather than further collaboration."", ""This is especially significant at a time when academics are increasingly encouraged to compete for scarce resources and demonstrate the 'impact' of their work (for instance, through involvement with regulatory and advisory bodies)."", ""Furthermore, the sociology of bioethics is likely to continue to be perceived as an 'attack' by some bioethicists (and, indeed, perhaps even intended as such by some STS analysts)."", 'Accordingly, the apparent differences between bioethics and STS will need to bear careful and honest scrutiny; in so doing, the disciplines may be found to be less dissimilar than at first appears.', 'For instance, STS indictments of It should not be forgotten that the rise of empirical bioethics itself presents an interesting case for STS to explore.', 'For a related point, see Ashcroft [3].', ""bioethics that it is 'too close' to science recall some internal critiques, including those from feminist bioethicists who have sought especially deep critical engagement with biomedical institutions and practices [44,59,60] and bioethical scholarship itself [42,#AUTHOR_TAG,58]."", ""Indeed, STS critiques of bioethics being 'too close' to science are, in a sense, normative assertions about the ways that bioethics should (not) be carried out, and thus ultimately claims about how biomedicine should be governed."", 'Is this, we might ask, just another way of doing bioethics?', 'For some, these and related questions pertaining to the convergences and divergences of bioethics and STS will be irrelevant or mundane-but to others they will be anathema.', 'It is precisely because of this that they will need to be articulated and explored, in order that the opportunities and disincentives to collaboration between STS and bioethics are appropriately engaged with and interrogated, and the potential benefits to scholarship realised.']",0,"[""bioethics that it is 'too close' to science recall some internal critiques, including those from feminist bioethicists who have sought especially deep critical engagement with biomedical institutions and practices [44,59,60] and bioethical scholarship itself [42,#AUTHOR_TAG,58].""]"

Svendsen"", ""Lene Koch""]","In 2003 it became legal to carry out human embryonic stem (hES) cell research in Denmark using embryos that are considered 'spare' in connection with fertility treatment. The public debate preceding the change of the Fertility Act presented the 'spare' embryo as a biological fact and discussed whether it was possible and morally acceptable to connect a given stock of 'spare' embryos to the stem cell lab. This paper tells a different story. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in a fertility clinic in Copenhagen and among stem cell researchers, we argue that 'spare' embryos are not straightforward biological facts. Rather, complex decision-making processes constitute embryos as 'spare' and thus as possible objects of exchange between couples in fertility treatment, stem cell researchers and future citizens in need of regenerative medicine. The ongoing fact-making of the 'spare' embryo in the fertility clinic reveals the network of relationships and conflicting responsibilities in which clinicians are positioned. Using the spatial metaphor of a moral landscape we explore how clinicians try out new moral pathways when seeking alternative ways to obtain and classify embryos as 'spare'. We argue that changing moral landscapes and 'spare' embryos are being co-produced in the development of hES cell research.","Within this field, the collection of 'spare embryos' is central to research; yet, the construal of an embryo as 'spare' must be achieved through careful ethical argumentation and deliberation which is itself experimental [14,#AUTHOR_TAG].","[""We can see likewise see that research trajectories and designs are powerfully impacted not only by formal governance and legislation, but also by the everyday ethics of researchers-as well as by study coordinators and managers who may attempt to use ''informal ethical practices'' in attempt to ''reinsert care into research'' [16: 689]."", 'The significance of everyday ethics has been documented, for instance, in studies of controversial areas of investigations such as stem cell science.', ""Within this field, the collection of 'spare embryos' is central to research; yet, the construal of an embryo as 'spare' must be achieved through careful ethical argumentation and deliberation which is itself experimental [14,#AUTHOR_TAG]."", ""Here, as elsewhere, boundaries between un/ethical forms of investigations are discursively constructed which at one ''define and defend the work of scientists involved in ethically sensitive research'' [67: 745].""]",0,"[""Within this field, the collection of 'spare embryos' is central to research; yet, the construal of an embryo as 'spare' must be achieved through careful ethical argumentation and deliberation which is itself experimental [14,#AUTHOR_TAG].""]"

This suggests they possess moral expertise even if they do not exercise it directly and without constraint. Moral expertise is defined, and four arguments given in support of scepticism about their possession of such expertise are considered and rejected: the existence of extreme disagreement between moral philosophers about moral matters; the lack of a means clearly to identify moral experts; that expertise cannot be claimed in that which lacks objectivity; and that ordinary people do not follow the advice of moral experts. I offer a better reason for scepticism grounded in the relation between moral philosophy and common-sense morality: namely that modern moral philosophy views even a developed moral theory as ultimately anchored in common-sense morality, that set of basic moral precepts which ordinary individuals have command of and use to regulate their own lives. Even if moral philosophers do nevertheless have a limited moral expertise, in that they alone can fully develop a set of moral judgments, I sketch reasons - grounded in the values of autonomy and of democracy - why moral philosophers should not wish non-philosophers to defer to their putative expertise",Several other terms and phrases used in STS that a range of practitioners from other disciplines may be familiar with also have specific meanings when deployed within the field's specialist journals #AUTHOR_TAG ,"[""Several other terms and phrases used in STS that a range of practitioners from other disciplines may be familiar with also have specific meanings when deployed within the field's specialist journals #AUTHOR_TAG ""]",0,"[""Several other terms and phrases used in STS that a range of practitioners from other disciplines may be familiar with also have specific meanings when deployed within the field's specialist journals #AUTHOR_TAG ""]"

Reconstructing the history of these critiques, John H. Zammito argues that while so-called postpositivist theories of science are very often invoked, they actually provide little support for fashionable postmodern approaches to science studies. Zammito shows how problems that Quine and Kuhn saw in the philosophy of the natural sciences inspired a turn to the philosophy of language for resolution. This linguistic turn led to claims that science needs to be situated in both historical and social contexts, but the claims of recent ""science studies"" only deepened the philosophical quandary. In essence, Zammito argues that none of the problems with positivism provides the slightest justification for denigrating empirical inquiry and scientific practice, delivering quite a blow to the ""discipline"" postmodern science studies. Filling a gap in scholarship to date, A Nice Derangement of Epistemes will appeal to historians, philosophers, philosophers of science, and the broader scientific community.","As the so-called 'Science Wars' of the 1990 s might remind us #AUTHOR_TAG, influential individuals do not always take kindly to having the 'black box' [55] of their work unpacked and its contents inspected.","['It is likewise unsurprising that some bioethicists might take STS in general and the sociology of bioethics in particular to be critical of their enterprise.', ""As the so-called 'Science Wars' of the 1990 s might remind us #AUTHOR_TAG, influential individuals do not always take kindly to having the 'black box' [55] of their work unpacked and its contents inspected."", ""Furthermore, it is clear that STS scholarship in this area does often contain critique; for instance, bioethics has been read as being 'too close' to science, compromising its objectivity, and providing legitimacy for controversial scientific endeavours. 3"", ""More generally, the emphasis of STS on expertise might also be deemed problematic to bioethics; research orientated towards deconstructing not only the knowledge claims of bioethicists but also who is legitimately entitled to expound them leads to the 'problem' of potentially undermining the status of the bioethicist as an expert who occupies a privileged role in the governance of biomedicine. 4"", 'though we know from STS itself that objectivity is a social and culturally embedded construct and achievement rather than something that pre-exists attempts to practice it [8]. 4', 'Of course, bioethicists are no unreflecitive in regards to their own claims to expertise; see, for instance, Archard [2] and Ives and Dunn [28].']",0,"[""As the so-called 'Science Wars' of the 1990 s might remind us #AUTHOR_TAG, influential individuals do not always take kindly to having the 'black box' [55] of their work unpacked and its contents inspected."", ""Furthermore, it is clear that STS scholarship in this area does often contain critique; for instance, bioethics has been read as being 'too close' to science, compromising its objectivity, and providing legitimacy for controversial scientific endeavours. 3""]"

It raises difficult questions about clients' and service providers' autonomy and responsibility and about which human illnesses, conditions, and characteristics ought to be the subject of research and testing. In particular, we show how differences in the amount and type of information and advice available to clients of genetic testing, the level of social support to people with particular conditions, and people's perception of stigma, suffering, and quality of life, make drawing the line highly problematic. We end by discussing the implications of our analysis for policy making, considering how the ambiguities and tensions in lay accounts might enable, as opposed to stifle, greater democratization of the new genetics.","As STS scholars have shown, publics can be both knowledgeable about biomedicine and willing to engage in sustained debate and analysis about issues that bioethicists are grappling with [#AUTHOR_TAG,56]; limiting participation is thus unfortunate not only for democractic reasons, but also because potentially 'useful' contributions from those outside the academiy remain unheard.","['The attention of STS to lived experience may also widen the bioethical gaze in regards to public engagement.', 'Activities in this vein are often used as fora within which to educate non-scientists about biomedical developments whilst also promoting wider discussion of their social and ethical aspects.', 'Yet, often an expert-lay divide is perpetuated which closes down opportunities for more reflexive debate [35].', ""Accordingly, the fresh perspectives that might be gleaned from public participants and which might have salience to bioethicists are 'framed out'."", 'In so doing, opportunities for more democratic forms of bioethical deliberation are also restricted [53].', ""As STS scholars have shown, publics can be both knowledgeable about biomedicine and willing to engage in sustained debate and analysis about issues that bioethicists are grappling with [#AUTHOR_TAG,56]; limiting participation is thus unfortunate not only for democractic reasons, but also because potentially 'useful' contributions from those outside the academiy remain unheard."", 'However, some investigators working within bioethics are drawing on STS research and explicitly seeking to enrol wider publics into ethical analysis (e.g.', '[41,63]).', 'Such work has the potential to enrich both STS studies of expertise and deliberation, and bioethical frameworks for thinking about the impacts and acceptable limits of biomedical innovation.']",3,"[""As STS scholars have shown, publics can be both knowledgeable about biomedicine and willing to engage in sustained debate and analysis about issues that bioethicists are grappling with [#AUTHOR_TAG,56]; limiting participation is thus unfortunate not only for democractic reasons, but also because potentially 'useful' contributions from those outside the academiy remain unheard.""]"

However, in the three sites reported on here, which received this funding, most of the embryos used for hESC research came from long term cryopreservation storage and/or outside clinics. In this paper we explore some of the clinical, technical, social and ethical factors that might help to explain this situation. We report from our qualitative study of the ethical frameworks for approaching women/couples for donation of embryos to stem cell research.

Social and ethical factors include acknowledging and responding to uncertainty in classifying embryos; retaining 'fluidity' in the grading system to give embryos 'every chance'; tensions between standardisation and variation in enacting a 'fair' grading system; enhancement of patient choice and control, and prevention of regret; and incorporation of patients' values in construction of ethically acceptable embryo 'spareness' ('frozen' embryos, and embryos determined through preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to be genetically 'affected'). We argue that the success of the 'built moral environment' of ACU with adjoining stem cell laboratories building projects intended to facilitate the 'IVF-stem cell interface' may depend not only on architecture, but also on the part such social and ethical factors play in configuration of embryos as particular kinds of moral work objects.","Within this field, the collection of 'spare embryos' is central to research; yet, the construal of an embryo as 'spare' must be achieved through careful ethical argumentation and deliberation which is itself experimental [#AUTHOR_TAG,66].","[""We can see likewise see that research trajectories and designs are powerfully impacted not only by formal governance and legislation, but also by the everyday ethics of researchers-as well as by study coordinators and managers who may attempt to use ''informal ethical practices'' in attempt to ''reinsert care into research'' [16: 689]."", 'The significance of everyday ethics has been documented, for instance, in studies of controversial areas of investigations such as stem cell science.', ""Within this field, the collection of 'spare embryos' is central to research; yet, the construal of an embryo as 'spare' must be achieved through careful ethical argumentation and deliberation which is itself experimental [#AUTHOR_TAG,66]."", ""Here, as elsewhere, boundaries between un/ethical forms of investigations are discursively constructed which at one ''define and defend the work of scientists involved in ethically sensitive research'' [67: 745].""]",0,"[""Within this field, the collection of 'spare embryos' is central to research; yet, the construal of an embryo as 'spare' must be achieved through careful ethical argumentation and deliberation which is itself experimental [#AUTHOR_TAG,66].""]"

Expectations of how pharmacogenetics might emerge in each of these arenas are actively shaping the trajectory of this nascent technology and its potential socio-economic consequences.","Particular foci of work in this vein are explorations of the place, role and impact of public bioethics in policy and biomedicine [32,48,61,62], and examinations of the mutual reinforcement-and perhaps co-production-of social and epistemic innovation in regards to controversial and/or promissory technoscience [22,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['One particular focus of STS literature has been the sociology of bioethics; that is, the study of the social life of bioethical problems, the role of knowledge and technology in structuring and defining these, the political economy of the solutions reached, and the methods by which they are achieved.', 'Particular foci of work in this vein are explorations of the place, role and impact of public bioethics in policy and biomedicine [32,48,61,62], and examinations of the mutual reinforcement-and perhaps co-production-of social and epistemic innovation in regards to controversial and/or promissory technoscience [22,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'Here, the reciprocal formation of neuroscience and neuroethics is a salient case in point [6,7].']",5,"['Particular foci of work in this vein are explorations of the place, role and impact of public bioethics in policy and biomedicine [32,48,61,62], and examinations of the mutual reinforcement-and perhaps co-production-of social and epistemic innovation in regards to controversial and/or promissory technoscience [22,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'Here, the reciprocal formation of neuroscience and neuroethics is a salient case in point [6,7].']"

The aim was to have a mix of presentations from postgraduates, themed into sections that were headed up by plenary talks from more established academics. The secondary aim, and the one on which I shall focus here, was to explore the possibilities of interdisciplinary work in bioethics, specifically what is increasingly becoming known as 'empirical bioethics'. Empirical bioethics is arguably evolving as a field in response to the social science critique of bioethics (see, for example, [11]), which charges traditional (read 'philosophical') bioethics as being too abstract, too general, and insensitive to social realities and context. Empirical bioethics seeks to meet that challenge by developing ways of contextualising philosophical moral theorising, and locating it within a discourse that draws on empirical data (generally qualitative) and moral theory. The idea is to produce a contextualised ethical analysis, which is both sensitive to the lived experiences of stakeholders and yet still critically normative.

Fixation associated with plant roots or in soil and peat samples had little or no significance for nitrogen input to the ecosystem. The ability to support an epiphytic flora of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria varied greatly between bryophyte species.Calliergon richardsonii andSanionia uncinata seemed especially well adapted for harbouring epiphytic cyanobacteria, but the extent of nitrogen fixation varied with the growing location. The rate of nitrogen fixation was greatly influenced by grazing by geese. In a geese-grazing area values were found with a maximum of 693.6±1.5 nmol C2H4h_1 g (dry weight)_1 while the maximum value for ungrazed areas was 65.3±16.6 nmol C2H4h_1 g (dry weight)_1. In the grazed area cyanobacteria were also found fixing nitrogen epiphytically on grass. The high plant productivity, supporting heavy grazing, clearly indicates an effective transfer of fixed nitrogen to the plant community.

Its limited availability frequently constrains growth and productivity, both of individual organisms, such as lichens (Chapter 13 and Crittenden et al. 1994), and of ecosystems as a whole. On the other hand, nitrogen may also be present in excessive amounts in some regions, such as those affected by high deposition of ammonia associated with fertilizer use and/or animal husbandry. Because nitrogen is not part of the Earth's crust's material, rock weathering and subsequent soil formation do not provide a nitrogen source, as they do for many other elements. Rather the principal pool of nitrogen is atmospheric nitrogen N2, which is not readily utilized by most organisms. Nitrate (NO3_) and ammonia (NH3, or ammonium ions, NH4+) are the inorganic forms of nitrogen that are universally processed by organisms, and their availability is critical to growth and survival of green-algal lichens (Chapter 10). With chlorolichens, nitrogen concentrations can often be related to atmospheric deposition of these ions (HyvŠrinen and Crittenden 1998a). At least some cyanolichens are part of the small group of organisms, including some bacteria and actinomycetes, capable of utilizing atmospheric N2 directly. As a result cyanolichens have higher total N concentrations (2.2Ð4.7%) than chlorolichens (0.4Ð0.85%) (Rai 1988). Because cyanolichens are abundant in a number of ecosystems, their potential contribution to nitrogen fixation in these ecosystems has led to attempts to quantify the rate of nitrogen fixation by these lichens and to understand the environmental and physiological factors limiting their fixation rates.","In lichens, cyanobacteria are a symbiont which provide their fungal partner with nitrogen from fixed atmospheric N in exchange for physical protection and-in the case of tripartite lichens-from carbohydrates in the fungi (#AUTHOR_TAG 1996).","['Through the quantification of interspecific variation in plant functional traits, comparative plant ecology has gained momentum in explaining species distributions, tradeoffs in biochemistry and physiology, as well as whole-ecosystem processes (Westoby and Wright 2006).', 'Lavorel et al.

Isotopic fractionations during soil N transformations and possibly during plant N uptake could lead to observed differences in 15N contents among plant species and between plants and soils. Patterns of variation in 15N content among species indicate that tundra plants acquire nitrogen in extremely nutrient-poor environments by competitive partitioning of the overall N pool.

They form symbiotic relationships with a broad range of eukaryotic hosts including plants, fungi, and animals such as corals, sponges, and ascidians (sea squirts). The plant and fungal symbioses are the subject of this chapter. Within the host, the cyanobacterial symbionts (cyanobionts) are protected from environmental extremes and predation, in turn supplying the host with fixed nitrogen and, in the case of nonphotosynthetic hosts, fixed carbon. Many cyanobacteria are facultative heterotrophs, enabling them to occupy regions of the host receiving little or no light, such as the roots of plants, where they receive fixed carbon from their photosynthetic partner. In the vast majority of these symbioses, the cyanobionts are capable of independent growth, but in symbiosis they often undergo morphological and physiological modifications. In many filamentous cyanobionts, nitrogen fixation occurs in specialized cells known as heterocysts which, in free-living cyanobacteria, constitute less than 10 % of total cells.

The percentage of total annual ecosystem N input due to biological nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria might be as high as 80% and the contribution to total annual N uptake by plants up to 20%. A possible reduction of nitrogen fixation raises serious concerns about already nutrient impoverished plant communities. This review shows that nitrogen fixation by moss-associated cyanobacteria in arctic vegetation was dramatically reduced after six years of exposure to enhanced UV-B radiation. In subarctic vegetation, nitrogen fixation activity of moss-associated cyanobacteria was not affected by 6 years of enhanced UV-B radiation. However, a 50% increase of summer precipitation resulted in a 5- to 6-fold increase in activity. Long-term effects of UV-B radiation on nitrogen fixation activity have been examined only in two lichens, giving contrasting results. Peltigera aphthosa (L.) Willd., having external cephalodia, experienced a significant reduction, whereas Peltigera didactyla (With.) J.R. Laudon, having cyanobacteria in the photobiont layer below the upper cortex, did not experience any changes due to radiation regimes. The difference is probably related to the location of the cyanobacteria. While the Nostoc cells are protected by the fungal, melanized upper cortex in P. didactyla, they are exposed and unprotected in P. aphthosa, and their own synthesis of UV-B absorbing compounds appears to be low. Under certain environmental conditions, an increasing UV-B radiation will dramatically affect nitrogen fixation in arctic tundra vegetation, which in turn may have severe influence on the nitrogen budget in these environments. Further long-term studies are necessary to conclude if these effects are temporal and how concurrent climatic changes will influence the nitrogen balance of the ecosystem.

Some mosses and liverworts produce significant levels of vitamin B2 and tocopherols, as well as prostaglandin-like highly unsaturated fatty acids.

Are the health and productivity of Sweden's forests at risk from too much nitrogen from acid deposition? We evaluated this question by posing a number of specific questions, and synthesized information from the extensive research in Sweden on N deposition, fertilization and forest growth. We addressed the questions: Have Swedish forest soils acidified in recent decades? Are Swedish forest saturated with N, or do they have an excess of N? Will excessive N lead to forest decline? Will liming or vitalisation fertilization improve forest nutrition and health? We examined the ideas behind these questions, the available evidence, and whether the evidence supported or refuted the ideas. Several studies have documented reductions in soil pH (measured in water) in Swedish forests over periods of several decades. This acidification has been accompanied by increases in ionic strength of soil solutions, reduced base saturation and increased soil organic matter. The importance of each of these acidifying processes has not been investigated directly, but evidence supports a substantial role for each mechanism in at least some cases. Current expectations about rates of mineral weathering are not consistent with the evidence; rates of weathering appear to be greater than expected, and to differ depending on tree species. Swedish forests are not saturated with N; only a few stands near the southwest coast (with the highest deposition rates) show leaching losses of N that rival N deposition rates. Across all regions of Sweden, inadequate supplies of N limit forest growth. Within each region, some stands fail to respond to N fertilization (or respond with a decrease in growth), which is common for other forest types in other countries. Stands that have received heavy fertilization with N may become responsive to further fertilization with phosphorus (P) or base cations, and fertilization with trace amounts of boron (B) may be important on some soils. No evidence supports any widespread responsiveness of the forests to fertilization with other elements unless N is also added. Vitalisation fertilization (with non-N nutrients) has not demonstrated substantial improvements in tree growth, although most experiments have focused on N-limited sites rather than N-excess sites. Liming studies from Sweden and around Scandinavia indicate that forest health typically suffers after liming, including growth losses of 5 to 10% lasting one or more decades. The forests of Sweden averaged about 30% greater growth per hectare in the 1990s than in the 1950s, and extensive forest inventories show no indication of abnormal forest declines within this overall picture of improving growth. Hypotheses of declining forest growth as a function of the ratio of base cations to aluminum in soil solution can be tested with N fertilization experiments. The cation ratios uniformly declined with N fertilization, but growth typically increased, refuting the idea that cation ratios can represent changes in forest productivity. We conclude that no evidence supports the hypothesis of past or current deposition of N has reduced the health or productivity of Sweden's forests; the opposite may have occurred. We also stress that several important questions cannot be addressed satisfactorily with current information. In particular, we recommend additional research on sites where N leaching rivals N deposition, elucidating mechanisms controlling N leaching and responses of trees to excessive levels of soil N","In comparison, atmospheric deposition levels of nitrate (NO y ) and ammonia (NH x ), as reported in a survey by the Swedish Environmental Research Institute, are less than 0.4 g N m 2 yr 1 for the region of North Sweden (#AUTHOR_TAG and Hogberg 1997)","['In comparison, atmospheric deposition levels of nitrate (NO y ) and ammonia (NH x ), as reported in a survey by the Swedish Environmental Research Institute, are less than 0.4 g N m 2 yr 1 for the region of North Sweden (#AUTHOR_TAG and Hogberg 1997)']",0,"['In comparison, atmospheric deposition levels of nitrate (NO y ) and ammonia (NH x ), as reported in a survey by the Swedish Environmental Research Institute, are less than 0.4 g N m 2 yr 1 for the region of North Sweden (#AUTHOR_TAG and Hogberg 1997)']"

There is also growing consensus about a shortlist of plant traits that should underlie such functional plant classifications, because they have strong predictive power of important ecosystem responses to environmental change and/or they themselves have strong impacts on ecosystem processes.

Yet these organisms are paramount determinants of biogeochemistry in several biomes, particularly cold biomes and tropical rainforests, where they: (1) contribute substantially to above-ground biomass (lichens, bryophytes); (2) host nitrogen-fixing bacteria, providing major soil N input (lichens, bryophytes); (3) control soil chemistry and nutrition through the accumulation of recalcitrant polyphenols (bryophytes) and through their control over soil and vegetation hydrology and temperatures; (4) both promote erosion (rock weathering by lichens) and prevent it (biological crusts in deserts); (5) provide a staple food to mammals such as reindeer (lichens) and arthropodes, with important feedbacks to soils and biota; and (6) both facilitate and compete with vascular plants.Here we review current knowledge about interspecific variation in cryptogam traits with respect to biogeochemical cycling and discuss to what extent traits and measuring protocols needed for bryophytes and lichens correspond with those applied to vascular plants. We also propose and discuss several new or recently introduced traits that may help us understand and predict the control of cryptogams over several aspects of the biogeochemistry of ecosystems.Whilst many methodological challenges lie ahead, comparative cryptogam ecology has the potential to meet some of the important challenges of understanding and predicting the biogeochemical and climate consequences of large-scale environmental changes driving shifts in the cryptogam components of vegetation composition.","Indeed, bryophytes and lichens are of particular importance in cold biomes such as the Arctic tundra (Longton 1997), where they are key contributors to green biomass and control soil hydrology, temperatures and chemistry (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2007).","['Through the quantification of interspecific variation in plant functional traits, comparative plant ecology has gained momentum in explaining species distributions, tradeoffs in biochemistry and physiology, as well as whole-ecosystem processes (Westoby and Wright 2006).', 'Lavorel et al.

The nitrogenase activity in Stereocaulon paschale mats in spruce-lichen woodland of central subarctic Canada has been examined in relation to thallus water content, temperature and incident radiation. The results revealed that while the level of activity at any point in time is dependent upon operative levels of these environmental factors, it can also be strongly influenced by pretreatment. It is suggested that simple predictive models are not yet able to accurately describe levels of nitrogenase activity in nature and that estimates of N-input on an annual or seasonal basis may be precarious. Leaching of metabolites from, and decomposition of the thallus are the two principal potential pathways for nitrogen, subsequent to fixation by cyanophilic lichens. Quantitative information on the operation of these pathways in nature is required. Lichenized blue-green algae are probably among the principal agents of nitrogen (N2) fixation in drier terrestrial habitats of the Arctic and Subarctic (Schell & Alexander, 1973; Kallio & Kallio, 1975; Crittenden, 1975; Huss-Danell, 1977). Several investigators working in boreal-arctic systems have used measurements of nitrogenase activity in lichens obtained either under field conditions or in the laboratory to derive estimates of N-input per unit area by the lichen biomass in situ on a seasonal or annual basis. Estimates have been produced for cryptogamic communities on polygonal tundra at Barrow, Alaska, containing species of Peltigera and Stereocaulon (Alexander, 1974) and for Nephroma arcticum and Stereocaulon paschale in subarctic forests and heathlands in Fennoscandia (Kallio & Kallio, 1975; Huss-Danell, 1977). Similarly, Horne (1972) predicted annual N2 fixation by Collema pulposum (= C. tenax) on mossy gravel surfaces of Signy Island, Antarctica. The accurate determination of N-input is clearly of value in assessing the role of lichens in the nitrogen cycle and primary production in these habitats, a topic that is of considerable interest in view of sug1 Paper presented at the Second International Mycological Congress, Tampa, Florida, 1977, forming a part of the symposium entitled ""The Role of Lichens in Ecosystems."" 2 We are indebted to Dr. D.

The major shortcoming of such estimates is that their accuracy is unknown: the results of in situ measurements of nitrogenase activity over long periods have not been compared with those of predictive procedures applied to the same period. We have recently been examining the N2 fixing capabilities of S. paschale mats in spruce-lichen woodland in the Abitau-Dunvegan Lakes region of the Northwest Territories (60?21'N, 106'54'W). In this paper the results of in situ measurements of nitrogenase activity are discussed with particular reference to the problems associated with predictive modelling of N2 fixation by lichens. The probable pathways for nitrogen subsequent to fixation by lichens are also considered. NITROGEN FIXATION BY STEREOCAULON PASCHALE IN SPRUCE-LICHEN WOODLAND--A CASE STUDY The importance of Stereocaulon paschale as a major component of spruce-lichen woodland in central subarctic Canada has been reviewed by Kershaw (1977). The maintenance of large areas of open Stereocaulon-spruce woodland in this region is dependent upon the high frequency of forest fire, the latter being a natural facet of the environment in the boreal forest (see, e.g. Johnson & Rowe, 1975). In the AbitauDunvegan Lakes region the periodicity of fire is such that spruce woodland older than 200 y is infrequently encountered on drier terrain and the average reburn interval is less than 100 y (Maikawa & Kershaw, 1976). Stereocaulon paschale usually dominates the lichen synusia in spruce-lichen woodland of between 60 and 130 y old where almost pure carpets of this lichen may occur (Fig. 1). The acetylene (C2H2-) reduction technique (Stewart, Fitzgerald & Burris, 1967) with modifications after Stewart et al. (1971) was used to examine diurnal variation in rates of nitrogenase activity in a S. paschale mat in relation to thallus water content, temperature and incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR-photon flux density in the 400-700 nm wavelength range). The field studies were conducted in typical S. paschale woodland estimated by Maikawa (1976) to have been last burned in 1898. Sequential C2H2-reduction assays were performed during periods of natural diffuse radiation to avoid the acute problem of excessive elevation of thallus temperature within the incubation bottles that occurs at high levels of irradiance and each assay was begun within 2 min of removing the pseudopodetium from the lichen mat. Intensive monitoring programs of this kind were conducted on five occasions: 24-25 June, 6-7, 10-11 and 18-19 August 1976 and 10-11 May 1977. The results of two of these studies are presented here. On 17 August 1976 the lichen mat was wetted by rainfall commencing at 04.15 h and monitoring of nitrogenase activity began at 14.30 h the following day. Thallus temperature within the lichen mat was measured with micro-thermocouples (42 gauge wire) arranged in thermopiles and with the junctions embedded in the main stem of pseudopodetia within the upper 15 mm of the lichen canopy (Fig. 2a). A similar method was employed to monitor thallus temperature within the incubation bottles (Fig. 2b) thus providing a check on the extent of deviations from operative temperature in situ. Photosynthetically active radiation (Fig. 2b) was measured with a quantum sensor (Lambda Instruments Corporation), and pseudopodetia were weighed on an electrobalance immediately prior to incubation in order that water content could be determined after dry weight estimates had been obtained (Fig. 2c).

The boreal forests of Eurasia and North America lack any significant, widespread symbiotic N-fixing plants. With the exception of scattered stands of alder in early primary successional forests, N-fixation in boreal forests is considered to be extremely limited. Nitrogen-fixation in northern European boreal forests has been estimated at only 0.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1); however, organic N is accumulated in these ecosystems at a rate of 3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (ref. 8). Our limited understanding of the origin of boreal N is unacceptable given the extent of the boreal forest region, but predictable given our imperfect knowledge of N-fixation. Herein we report on a N-fixing symbiosis between a cyanobacterium (Nostoc sp.) and the ubiquitous feather moss, Pleurozium schreberi (Bird) Mitt. that alone fixes between 1.5 and 2.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in mid- to late-successional forests of northern Scandinavia and Finland.

Scattered intermittently over these landscapes are areas of cryptogamic crust development that are associated with increased vascular plant abundance. Since nutrient limitation, especially nitrogen, is significant in these ecosystems, I wished to examine the role of these cryptogamic crusts in the supply of fixed nitrogen and the constraints to that fixation. Nitrogen fixation rates (as measured by acetylene reduction) were highest in sites with a well-developed cryptogamic crust, lowest in sites with only bare mineral soil, and intermediate in sites with a partially developed crust. Highest rates of acetylene reduction (i.e., nitrogen fixation) were seen within a few days of snowmelt (late June to early July) and declined as the season progressed, until near the end of the growing season (1Ð5 August) when rates were approximately 50% of early season rates. Late season precipitation events restored acetylene reduction rates to near original levels. In manipulative experiments, acetylene reduction rates dropped dramatically as crust moisture content declined and rates increased as soil surface temperature increased to 24¡C. A significant finding was that acetylene reduction at 3¡C was 40% of that found at 12 to 13¡C. Thus, there is a potential for nitrogen accumulation even during the colder periods of the growing season. As calculations show, the quantity of nitrogen fixed by these cryptogamic crusts was adequate to support the nitrogen needs of the mosses and vascular plants of these developing ecosystems.",Most bryophytes have a high water retention capacity and thus provide a stable and favourable habitat for cyanobacterial growth and N fixation activity (#AUTHOR_TAG 2000).,"['Through the quantification of interspecific variation in plant functional traits, comparative plant ecology has gained momentum in explaining species distributions, tradeoffs in biochemistry and physiology, as well as whole-ecosystem processes (Westoby and Wright 2006).', 'Lavorel et al.

Many different approaches for statistical modelling of cumulative disease progression have been proposed in the literature, including simple path models up to complex restricted Bayesian networks. Important fields of application are diseases such as cancer and HIV. Tumour progression is measured by means of chromosome aberrations, whereas people infected with HIV develop drug resistances because of genetic changes of the HI-virus. These two very different diseases have typical courses of disease progression, which can be modelled partly by consecutive and partly by independent steps. This paper gives an overview of the different progression models and points out their advantages and drawbacks. Different models are compared via simulations to analyse how they work if some of their assumptions are violated. In a simulation study, we evaluate how models perform in terms of fitting induced multivariate probability distributions and topological relationships.

Inference of a temporal ordering on the level of genes is challenging because clinically and histologically identical tumors often have few mutated genes in common. This heterogeneity may at least in part be due to mutations in different genes having similar phenotypic effects by acting in the same functional pathway. We estimate the constraints on the order in which alterations accumulate during cancer progression from cross-sectional mutation data using a probabilistic graphical model termed Hidden Conjunctive Bayesian Network (H-CBN). The possible orders are analyzed on the level of genes and, after mapping genes to functional pathways, also on the pathway level. We find stronger evidence for pathway order constraints than for gene order constraints, indicating that temporal ordering results from selective pressure acting at the pathway level. The accumulation of changes in core pathways differs among cancer types, yet a common feature is that progression appears to begin with mutations in genes that regulate apoptosis pathways and to conclude with mutations in genes involved in invasion pathways. H-CBN models provide a quantitative and intuitive model of tumorigenesis showing that the genetic events can be linked to the phenotypic progression on the level of pathways.","For example, in colorectal cancer APC mutations are an early event that precedes mutations in KRAS [4][5]#AUTHOR_TAG.","['Cancer progression is caused by the sequential accumulation of somatic mutations, including changes in copy number (structural variants), single nucleotides (SNP variants) and DNA methylation patterns during the life of an individual [1][2][3].', 'Among the mutations causally responsible for the development of cancer (drivers) not all possible orders of accumulation seem equally likely, and the fixation of some mutations can depend on the presence of other mutations.', 'For example, in colorectal cancer APC mutations are an early event that precedes mutations in KRAS [4][5]#AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Understanding the restrictions in the temporal order of accumulation of driver mutations not only provides insights into cancer biology, but can help identify early markers of disease as well as therapeutic targets [5][6][7][8][9], and can be an instrumental tool in the search for the ""Achilles\' Heel"" of oncogene addiction [3,10,11].', 'In addition, understanding the correct order of events is necessary for the assessment of the validity of the genetic context of cell lines and animal models of human cancer [7,8].']",0,"['Cancer progression is caused by the sequential accumulation of somatic mutations, including changes in copy number (structural variants), single nucleotides (SNP variants) and DNA methylation patterns during the life of an individual [1][2][3].', 'Among the mutations causally responsible for the development of cancer (drivers) not all possible orders of accumulation seem equally likely, and the fixation of some mutations can depend on the presence of other mutations.', 'For example, in colorectal cancer APC mutations are an early event that precedes mutations in KRAS [4][5]#AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Understanding the restrictions in the temporal order of accumulation of driver mutations not only provides insights into cancer biology, but can help identify early markers of disease as well as therapeutic targets [5][6][7][8][9], and can be an instrumental tool in the search for the ""Achilles\' Heel"" of oncogene addiction [3,10,11].']"

Pepper"", ""Carlo C. Maley""]","The canonical route from normal tissue to cancer occurs through sequential acquisition of somatic mutations. Many studies have constructed a linear genetic model for tumorigenesis using the genetic alterations associated with samples at different stages of neoplastic progression from cross-sectional data. The common interpretation of these models is that they reflect the temporal order within any given tumor. Linear genetic methods implicitly neglect genetic heterogeneity within a neoplasm; each neoplasm is assumed to consist of one dominant clone. We modeled neoplastic progression of colorectal cancer using an agent-based model of a colon crypt and found clonal heterogeneity within our simulated neoplasms, as observed in vivo. Just 7.3% of cells within neoplasms acquired mutations in the same order as the linear model. In 41% of the simulated neoplasms, no cells acquired mutations in the same order as the linear model. We obtained similarly poor results when comparing the temporal order with oncogenetic tree models inferred from cross-sectional data. However, when we reconstructed the cell lineage of mutations within a neoplasm using several biopsies, we found that 99.7% cells within neoplasms acquired their mutations in an order consistent with the cell lineage mutational order. Thus, we find that using cross-sectional data to infer mutational order is misleading, whereas phylogenetic methods based on sampling intratumor heterogeneity accurately reconstructs the evolutionary history of tumors. In addition, we find evidence that disruption of differentiation is likely the first lesion in progression for most cancers and should be one of the few regularities of neoplastic progression across cancers.",This problem is highlighted by Sprouffske et al. #AUTHOR_TAG: referring to oncogenetic tree models they say (p.,"['Finally, development and evaluation of methods of reconstruction of order restrictions are conducted without consideration for the evolutionary model of tumor progression (but see [7,8] and Discussion).', 'This problem is highlighted by Sprouffske et al. #AUTHOR_TAG: referring to oncogenetic tree models they say (p.', '1136) ""This is not an evolutionary model because the oncogenetic tree does not represent ancestral relationships within a neoplasm but rather a summary of the observed co-occurrences of mutations across independent neoplasms"".', 'This lack of consideration for the evolutionary model is also unfortunate since it does not provide a clear mechanistic interpretation of (nor a simple mechanistically-based procedure for generating) deviations from the restrictions encoded in the graph.', 'Of particular interest is monotonicity (a mutation in a driver gene can only be observed if the preceding parent mutations in the graph have occurred), because deviations from it can easily arise when a mutation behaves as a driver or as a passenger depending on the genetic context -i.e., depending on which other genes are mutated [30,38].']",1,"['This problem is highlighted by Sprouffske et al. #AUTHOR_TAG: referring to oncogenetic tree models they say (p.', '1136) ""This is not an evolutionary model because the oncogenetic tree does not represent ancestral relationships within a neoplasm but rather a summary of the observed co-occurrences of mutations across independent neoplasms"".']"

Of special importance are changes that occur early during malignant transformation because they may result in oncogene addiction and thus represent promising targets for therapeutic intervention. We have previously described a computational approach, called Retracing the Evolutionary Steps in Cancer (RESIC), to determine the temporal sequence of genetic alterations during tumorigenesis from cross-sectional genomic data of tumors at their fully transformed stage. Since alterations within a set of genes belonging to a particular signaling pathway may have similar or equivalent effects, we applied a pathway-based systems biology approach to the RESIC methodology. This method was used to determine whether alterations of specific pathways develop early or late during malignant transformation. When applied to primary glioblastoma (GBM) copy number data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, RESIC identified a temporal order of pathway alterations consistent with the order of events in secondary GBMs. We then further subdivided the samples into the four main GBM subtypes and determined the relative contributions of each subtype to the overall results: we found that the overall ordering applied for the proneural subtype but differed for mesenchymal samples. The temporal sequence of events could not be identified for neural and classical subtypes, possibly due to a limited number of samples. Moreover, for samples of the proneural subtype, we detected two distinct temporal sequences of events: (i) RAS pathway activation was followed by TP53 inactivation and finally PI3K2 activation, and (ii) RAS activation preceded only AKT activation. This extension of the RESIC methodology provides an evolutionary mathematical approach to identify the temporal sequence of pathway changes driving tumorigenesis and may be useful in guiding the understanding of signaling rearrangements in cancer development.(c) 2012 Cheng et al.","Understanding the restrictions in the temporal order of accumulation of driver mutations not only provides insights into cancer biology, but can help identify early markers of disease as well as therapeutic targets [5][6]#AUTHOR_TAG[8][9], and can be an instrumental tool in the search for the ""Achilles' Heel"" of oncogene addiction [3,10,11].","['Cancer progression is caused by the sequential accumulation of somatic mutations, including changes in copy number (structural variants), single nucleotides (SNP variants) and DNA methylation patterns during the life of an individual [1][2][3].', 'Among the mutations causally responsible for the development of cancer (drivers) not all possible orders of accumulation seem equally likely, and the fixation of some mutations can depend on the presence of other mutations.', 'For example, in colorectal cancer APC mutations are an early event that precedes mutations in KRAS [4][5][6].', 'Understanding the restrictions in the temporal order of accumulation of driver mutations not only provides insights into cancer biology, but can help identify early markers of disease as well as therapeutic targets [5][6]#AUTHOR_TAG[8][9], and can be an instrumental tool in the search for the ""Achilles\' Heel"" of oncogene addiction [3,10,11].', 'In addition, understanding the correct order of events is necessary for the assessment of the validity of the genetic context of cell lines and animal models of human cancer [7,8].']",0,"['Understanding the restrictions in the temporal order of accumulation of driver mutations not only provides insights into cancer biology, but can help identify early markers of disease as well as therapeutic targets [5][6]#AUTHOR_TAG[8][9], and can be an instrumental tool in the search for the ""Achilles\' Heel"" of oncogene addiction [3,10,11].']"

Unlike simple path models of oncogenesis, our models allow dependencies to exist between specific genetic changes and allow for multiple, divergent paths in tumor progression. A variety of genetic events can be used with the graph models including chromosome breaks, losses or gains of large DNA regions, small mutations and changes in methylation.

Many passengers, however, fall within protein coding genes and other functional elements and can possibly have deleterious effects on cancer cells. Here we investigate a potential of mildly deleterious passengers to accumulate and alter the course of neoplastic progression. Our approach combines evolutionary simulations of cancer progression with the analysis of cancer sequencing data. In our simulations, individual cells stochastically divide, acquire advantageous driver and deleterious passenger mutations, or die. Surprisingly, despite selection against them, passengers accumulate and largely evade selection during progression. Although individually weak, the collective burden of passengers alters the course of progression leading to several phenomena observed in oncology that cannot be explained by a traditional driver-centric view. We tested predictions of the model using cancer genomic data. We find that many passenger mutations are likely to be damaging and that, in agreement with the model, they have largely evaded purifying selection. Finally, we used our model to explore cancer treatments that exploit the load of passengers by either 1) increasing the mutation rate; or 2) exacerbating their deleterious effects. While both approaches lead to cancer regression, the later leads to less frequent relapse. Our results suggest a new framework for understanding cancer progression as a balance of driver and passenger mutations.Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures and Supplemental Informatio","The second set of models, called ""McF_4"" and ""McF_6"", are based on McFarland et al's work #AUTHOR_TAG and lead to logistic-like behavior, as death rate depends on total population size.","['Simulated data were generated using different models of tumor progression.', 'The purpose of using several models is not to compare models of tumor development, but to use a range of plausible ones so that we can examine how the true underlying model could impact the inference of restrictions.', 'Two of the models used, called here ""Bozic"" (as it is based on [41]) and ""exp"" have no density dependence and lead to exponential growth.', 'The second set of models, called ""McF_4"" and ""McF_6"", are based on McFarland et al\'s work #AUTHOR_TAG and lead to logistic-like behavior, as death rate depends on total population size.', 'Table 2 summarizes the main parameters used for the models.']",5,"['Simulated data were generated using different models of tumor progression.', 'The purpose of using several models is not to compare models of tumor development, but to use a range of plausible ones so that we can examine how the true underlying model could impact the inference of restrictions.', 'Two of the models used, called here ""Bozic"" (as it is based on [41]) and ""exp"" have no density dependence and lead to exponential growth.', 'The second set of models, called ""McF_4"" and ""McF_6"", are based on McFarland et al\'s work #AUTHOR_TAG and lead to logistic-like behavior, as death rate depends on total population size.', 'Table 2 summarizes the main parameters used for the models.']"

Datta"", ""Alice Gutteridge"", ""Charles Swanton"", ""Carlo C. Maley"", ""Trevor A. Graham""]","The role of genetic instability in driving carcinogenesis remains controversial. Genetic instability should accelerate carcinogenesis by increasing the rate of advantageous driver mutations; however, genetic instability can also potentially retard tumour growth by increasing the rate of deleterious mutation. As such, it is unclear whether genetically unstable clones would tend to be more selectively advantageous than their genetically stable counterparts within a growing tumour. Here, we show the circumstances where genetic instability evolves during tumour progression towards cancer. We employ a Wright-Fisher type model that describes the evolution of tumour subclones. Clones can acquire both advantageous and deleterious mutations, and mutator mutations that increase a cell's intrinsic mutation rate. Within the model, cancers evolve with a mutator phenotype when driver mutations bestow only moderate increases in fitness: very strong or weak selection for driver mutations suppresses the evolution of a mutator phenotype. Genetic instability occurs secondarily to selectively advantageous driver mutations. Deleterious mutations have relatively little effect on the evolution of genetic instability unless selection for additional driver mutations is very weak or if deleterious mutations are very common. Our model provides a framework for studying the evolution of genetic instability in tumour progression. Our analysis highlights the central role of selection in shaping patterns of mutation in carcinogenesis.","Enforcing monotonicity is equivalent to considering such a mutation as a mutation in an essential housekeeping gene, which can be modeled setting s h , in the notation of #AUTHOR_TAG, to ___ (so fitness of such clones is zero).","['its dependencies satisfied) will lead to an increase in fitness (through its increase of the value j, for number of drivers, as shown in Table 2).', 'What about mutations in driver genes that do not have their dependencies satisfied?', 'Enforcing monotonicity is equivalent to considering such a mutation as a mutation in an essential housekeeping gene, which can be modeled setting s h , in the notation of #AUTHOR_TAG, to ___ (so fitness of such clones is zero).', 'Deviations from monotonicity can arise, however, if such mutation is similar to a passenger mutation: it confers no fitness benefits (and if it has no deleterious effect s h = 0, similar to setting s p = 0 in [42]).', 'Of course, in none of these two cases (restrictions not satisfied) would the value of j be increased (because a driver only increases fitness if its dependencies are satisfied).', 'In the simulations reported here I considered two extreme scenarios: a) no deviations from the graph of the oncogenetic model are allowed, which I will refer to as ""sh=Inf "" (from ___) ; b) drivers without dependencies satisfied are equivalent to passengers with no deleterious effects, which I will refer to as ""sh=0"".', 'Note that the implementations I used to infer CBN and OT incorporate errors [6,31,32] and the OT model explicitly allows for errors due to the occurrence of genetic events outside the model implied by the graph of the oncogenetic model [45].', 'DiProg (DiP), the method to infer Progression Networks models [12], explicitly incorporates deviations from monotonicity with the parameter ��.']",0,"['Enforcing monotonicity is equivalent to considering such a mutation as a mutation in an essential housekeeping gene, which can be modeled setting s h , in the notation of #AUTHOR_TAG, to ___ (so fitness of such clones is zero).']"

Whether presented as a processing step in a clinical experiment or treated in a stand-alone publication, novel bioinformatic algorithms are often not subjected to the thorough comparative evaluation endured by their counterparts in other closely related fields--such as computer science--where an algorithm unevaluated against extant methods is considered unpublishable. Two audiences are interested in algorithmic publications: the practitioner, who may use the algorithm, and the researcher, who will work to develop solutions superior to those extant. We argue that failure during the review/publication process to require comparative evaluation for novel algorithms is detrimental to both parties. To demonstrate the dilemma, we conducted a case study of novel LC-MS alignment algorithms.

Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points.

Mutations that confer a fitness advantage to the cell are known as driver mutations and are causally related to tumorigenesis. Other mutations, however, do not change the phenotype of the cell or even decrease cellular fitness. While much experimental effort is being devoted to the identification of the functional effects of individual mutations, mathematical modeling of tumor progression generally considers constant fitness increments as mutations are accumulated. In this paper we study a mathematical model of tumor progression with random fitness increments. We analyze a multi-type branching process in which cells accumulate mutations whose fitness effects are chosen from a distribution. We determine the effect of the fitness distribution on the growth kinetics of the tumor.

They were used to model HIV progression by accumulation of resistance mutations in the viral genome under drug pressure and cancer progression by accumulation of chromosomal aberrations in tumor cells. From the mixture models a genetic progression score (GPS) can be derived that estimates the genetic status of single patients according to the corresponding progression along the tree models. GPS values were shown to have predictive power for estimating drug resistance in HIV or the survival time in cancer. Still, the reliability of the exact values of such complex markers derived from graphical models can be questioned.In a simulation study, we analyzed various aspects of the stability of estimated mutagenetic trees mixture models. It turned out that the induced probabilistic distributions and the tree topologies are recovered with high precision by an EM-like learning algorithm. However, only for models with just one major model component, also GPS values of single patients can be reliably estimated.It is encouraging that the estimation process of mutagenetic trees mixture models can be performed with high confidence regarding induced probability distributions and the general shape of the tree topologies. For a model with only one major disease progression process, even genetic progression scores for single patients can be reliably estimated. However, for models with more than one relevant component, alternative measures should be introduced for estimating the stage of disease progression.","The results of #AUTHOR_TAG of course highlight that if different subjects have different sets of order restrictions, then no single OT will capture these patterns, a limitation that is already recognized in the early literature on ongenetic trees [14,15], and that has prompted the development of mixtures of oncogenetic trees [24,25,72].","['Sprouffske et al.

A major challenge in the interpretation of these data is to distinguish functional ""driver mutations"" important for cancer development from random ""passenger mutations."" A common approach for identifying driver mutations is to find genes that are mutated at significant frequency in a large cohort of cancer genomes. This approach is confounded by the observation that driver mutations target multiple cellular signaling and regulatory pathways. Thus, each cancer patient may exhibit a different combination of mutations that are sufficient to perturb these pathways. This mutational heterogeneity presents a problem for predicting driver mutations solely from their frequency of occurrence. We introduce two combinatorial properties, coverage and exclusivity, that distinguish driver pathways, or groups of genes containing driver mutations, from groups of genes with passenger mutations. We derive two algorithms, called Dendrix, to find driver pathways de novo from somatic mutation data. We apply Dendrix to analyze somatic mutation data from 623 genes in 188 lung adenocarcinoma patients, 601 genes in 84 glioblastoma patients, and 238 known mutations in 1000 patients with various cancers. In all data sets, we find groups of genes that are mutated in large subsets of patients and whose mutations are approximately exclusive. Our Dendrix algorithms scale to whole-genome analysis of thousands of patients and thus will prove useful for larger data sets to come from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other large-scale cancer genome sequencing projects.","Thus, it probably pays off to try to use other approaches that incorporate information about non-silent mutation rates, pathway information together with combinatorial properties of drivers in pathwayws, or functional consequences of mutations to differentiate drivers from passengers [73][74][75][76][77]#AUTHOR_TAG.","['In more detail, OT and OT-A are the best methods, except if we are particularly interested in minimizing PND and we suspect conjunctions are present (when we might want to consider CBN) or FPF (when we might want to consider DiProg -recalling that FPF is generally of minor value compared to measures PND and PFD).', 'Since it is impossible for OT to return any conjunctions, further research on computationally efficient methods to recover conjunctions is sorely needed.', '3.

Driver mutations generally target cellular signaling and regulatory pathways consisting of multiple genes. This heterogeneity complicates the identification of driver mutations by their recurrence across samples, as different combinations of mutations in driver pathways are observed in different samples. We introduce the Multi-Dendrix algorithm for the simultaneous identification of multiple driver pathways de novo in somatic mutation data from a cohort of cancer samples. The algorithm relies on two combinatorial properties of mutations in a driver pathway: high coverage and mutual exclusivity. We derive an integer linear program that finds set of mutations exhibiting these properties. We apply Multi-Dendrix to somatic mutations from glioblastoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer samples. Multi-Dendrix identifies sets of mutations in genes that overlap with known pathways - including Rb, p53, PI(3)K, and cell cycle pathways - and also novel sets of mutually exclusive mutations, including mutations in several transcription factors or other genes involved in transcriptional regulation. These sets are discovered directly from mutation data with no prior knowledge of pathways or gene interactions. We show that Multi-Dendrix outperforms other algorithms for identifying combinations of mutations and is also orders of magnitude faster on genome-scale data.

In the absence of a full understanding of the neural correlates of consciousness, even a normal activation in response to passive sensory stimulation cannot be considered as proof of the presence of awareness in these patients. In contrast, predicted activation in response to the instruction to perform a mental imagery task would provide evidence of voluntary task-dependent brain activity, and hence of consciousness, in non-communicative patients. However, no data yet exist to indicate which imagery instructions would yield reliable single subject activation. The aim of the present study was to establish such a paradigm in healthy volunteers. Two exploratory experiments evaluated the reproducibility of individual brain activation elicited by four distinct mental imagery tasks. The two most robust mental imagery tasks were found to be spatial navigation and motor imagery. In a third experiment, where these two tasks were directly compared, differentiation of each task from one another and from rest periods was assessed blindly using a priori criteria and was correct for every volunteer. The spatial navigation and motor imagery tasks described here permit the identification of volitional brain activation at the single subject level, without a motor response.

Acquired motor skills offer a unique way to test this question, since people differ widely in the actions they have learned to perform. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study differences in brain activity between watching an action that one has learned to do and an action that one has not, in order to assess whether the brain processes of action observation are modulated by the expertise and motor repertoire of the observer. Experts in classical ballet, experts in capoeira and inexpert control subjects viewed videos of ballet or capoeira actions. Comparing the brain activity when dancers watched their own dance style versus the other style therefore reveals the influence of motor expertise on action observation. We found greater bilateral activations in premotor cortex and intraparietal sulcus, right superior parietal lobe and left posterior superior temporal sulcus when expert dancers viewed movements that they had been trained to perform compared to movements they had not. Our results show that this 'mirror system' integrates observed actions of others with an individual's personal motor repertoire, and suggest that the human brain understands actions by motor simulation.","Some studies have made use of the motor expertise model to investigate the link between the action execution and action perception network (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005;Calvo-Merino et al., 2006;Orgs et al., 2008) and motor learning (Cross et al. 2006).","['Cognitive neuroscience research has also investigated the neural mechanisms of motor imagery in the control of action (e.g.', 'see deLange, Roelofs & Toni, 2008).', 'In the same way that visual imagery and visual perception recruit similar brain regions (Ganis et al., 2004), several studies have shown that during imagination of a movement, the same sensorimotor regions are activated as when we observe a movement or actually execute it ourselves (Decety et al., 1994;Gr��zes & Decety, 2001).', 'Some studies have made use of the motor expertise model to investigate the link between the action execution and action perception network (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005;Calvo-Merino et al., 2006;Orgs et al., 2008) and motor learning (Cross et al. 2006).', 'Other studies have focused on the underlying neural mechanisms of creativity in realms other than dance (Jung et al., 2010), especially in music (Limb and Braun, 2008) and drawing (Bhattacharya & Petsche, 2005).', ""The bulk of these studies have been based upon the researchers' expectations concerning motor responses, rather than seeking to correlate activity with subjective reports of motor imagery, so while they have focused upon motor or movement related brain processes, wide ranging networks are implicated and the possible involvement of multiple forms of imagery in such tasks remains to be clarified.""]",5,"['Some studies have made use of the motor expertise model to investigate the link between the action execution and action perception network (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005;Calvo-Merino et al., 2006;Orgs et al., 2008) and motor learning (Cross et al. 2006).']"

Limb"", ""Allen R. Braun""]","To investigate the neural substrates that underlie spontaneous musical performance, we examined improvisation in professional jazz pianists using functional MRI. By employing two paradigms that differed widely in musical complexity, we found that improvisation (compared to production of over-learned musical sequences) was consistently characterized by a dissociated pattern of activity in the prefrontal cortex: extensive deactivation of dorsolateral prefrontal and lateral orbital regions with focal activation of the medial prefrontal (frontal polar) cortex. Such a pattern may reflect a combination of psychological processes required for spontaneous improvisation, in which internally motivated, stimulus-independent behaviors unfold in the absence of central processes that typically mediate self-monitoring and conscious volitional control of ongoing performance. Changes in prefrontal activity during improvisation were accompanied by widespread activation of neocortical sensorimotor areas (that mediate the organization and execution of musical performance) as well as deactivation of limbic structures (that regulate motivation and emotional tone). This distributed neural pattern may provide a cognitive context that enables the emergence of spontaneous creative activity.","Other studies have focused on the underlying neural mechanisms of creativity in realms other than dance (Jung et al., 2010), especially in music (#AUTHOR_TAG and Braun, 2008) and drawing (Bhattacharya & Petsche, 2005).","['Cognitive neuroscience research has also investigated the neural mechanisms of motor imagery in the control of action (e.g.', 'see deLange, Roelofs & Toni, 2008).', 'In the same way that visual imagery and visual perception recruit similar brain regions (Ganis et al., 2004), several studies have shown that during imagination of a movement, the same sensorimotor regions are activated as when we observe a movement or actually execute it ourselves (Decety et al., 1994;Gr��zes & Decety, 2001).', 'Some studies have made use of the motor expertise model to investigate the link between the action execution and action perception network (Calvo-Merino et al., 2005;Calvo-Merino et al., 2006;Orgs et al., 2008) and motor learning (Cross et al. 2006).', 'Other studies have focused on the underlying neural mechanisms of creativity in realms other than dance (Jung et al., 2010), especially in music (#AUTHOR_TAG and Braun, 2008) and drawing (Bhattacharya & Petsche, 2005).', ""The bulk of these studies have been based upon the researchers' expectations concerning motor responses, rather than seeking to correlate activity with subjective reports of motor imagery, so while they have focused upon motor or movement related brain processes, wide ranging networks are implicated and the possible involvement of multiple forms of imagery in such tasks remains to be clarified.""]",0,"['Other studies have focused on the underlying neural mechanisms of creativity in realms other than dance (Jung et al., 2010), especially in music (#AUTHOR_TAG and Braun, 2008) and drawing (Bhattacharya & Petsche, 2005).']"

Such refinements may rely on common or on distinct processes and representations. Multi-level theories of cognition and affect make distinctions between qualitatively different types of representations often dealing with bodily, affective and cognitive attributes of self-related meanings. This paper will adopt a particular multi-level perspective on mental architecture and show how a mechanism of subsystem differentiation could have allowed an evolutionarily ""old"" role for emotion in the control of action to have altered into one more closely coupled to meaning systems.

To this purpose, we studied multichannel electroencephalograph (EEG) signals from two broad groups (all participants were females): artists (professionally trained in visual arts) and non-artists (without any training in art). To assess the underlying synchronization, which is assumed to be the platform for general cognitive integration between different cortical regions, three measures inspired by nonlinear dynamical system theory were applied as follows: (1) index based on generalized synchronization; (2) index based on mean phase coherence; and (3) index of phase synchrony based on entropy. Results consistent over all three measures were as follows: comparing the tasks to rest, the artists showed significantly stronger short- and long-range delta band synchronization, whereas the non-artists showed enhancement in short-range beta and gamma band synchronization primarily in frontal regions; comparing the two groups during the tasks, the artists showed significantly stronger delta band synchronization and alpha band desynchronization than did the non-artists. Strong right hemispheric dominance in terms of synchronization was found in the artists. In artists, the higher synchrony in the low-frequency band is possibly due to the involvement of a more advanced long-term visual art memory and to extensive top-down processing. The results demonstrate that in artists, patterns of functional cooperation between cortical regions during mental creation of drawings were significantly different from those in non-artists.","Moreover, several studies have examined the brain activity of creative artists (#AUTHOR_TAG  Fink, Graif & Neubauer, 2009), and data obtained in this way offers the prospect of investigating the neural underpinnings of choreographic practice.","['Mental Imagery has been extensively investigated both in cognitive and neuroscience laboratories (Kosslyn, Ganis & Thompson, 2009) and in applied settings, for example to improve performance in competitive sports (Murphy, 1990).', 'Studies of internal mental states such as imagery are controversial precisely because they have long been seen as subjective, and not open to objective quantification.', 'Modern brain scanning techniques offer the prospect of providing collateral evidence for the involvement of different forms of imagery, since they enable us to test whether activity in function-specific brain regions known to be involved in, for example, visuo-spatial experiences, motor control or decision making is correlated with subjective reports of the use of that imagery.', ""Owen & Coleman (2008), for example, used the detection of neural activity associated with different forms of imagined activity (playing tennis, or walking around one's home) to show that a patient in a vegetative state, who could not respond physically, could respond mentally to oral instructions."", 'Moreover, several studies have examined the brain activity of creative artists (#AUTHOR_TAG  Fink, Graif & Neubauer, 2009), and data obtained in this way offers the prospect of investigating the neural underpinnings of choreographic practice.']",0,"['Moreover, several studies have examined the brain activity of creative artists (#AUTHOR_TAG  Fink, Graif & Neubauer, 2009), and data obtained in this way offers the prospect of investigating the neural underpinnings of choreographic practice.']"

One such cognitive process Ð divergent thinking Ð is the process by which one extrapolates many possible answers to an initial stimulus or target data set. We sought to link well established measures of divergent thinking and creative achievement (Creative Achievement Questionnaire Ð CAQ) to cortical thickness in a cohort of young (23.7 ± 4.2 years), healthy subjects. Three independent judges ranked the creative products of each subject using the consensual assessment technique (Amabile, 1982) from which a Òcomposite creativity indexÓ (CCI) was derived. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was obtained at 1.5 Tesla Siemens scanner. Cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation were performed with the FreeSurfer image analysis suite. A region within the lingual gyrus was negatively correlated with CCI; the right posterior cingulate correlated positively with the CCI. For the CAQ, lower left lateral orbitofrontal volume correlated with higher creative achievement; higher cortical thickness was related to higher scores on the CAQ in the right angular gyrus. This is the first study to link cortical thickness measures to psychometric measures of creativity.

What is the contribution of the extrastriate body area (EBA) to this network? In particular, is the EBA involved in constructing a dynamic representation of observed actions? We scanned 16 participants with fMRI while they viewed two kinds of stimulus sequences. In the coherent condition, static frames from a movie of a single, intransitive whole-body action were presented in the correct order. In the incoherent condition, a series of frames from multiple actions (involving one actor) were presented. ROI analyses showed that the EBA, unlike area MT + and the posterior superior temporal sulcus, responded more to the incoherent than to the coherent conditions. Whole brain analyses revealed increased activation to the coherent sequences in parietal and frontal regions that have been implicated in the observation and control of movement. We suggest that the EBA response adapts when succeeding images depict relatively similar postures (coherent condition) compared to relatively different postures (incoherent condition). We propose that the EBA plays a unique role in the perception of action, by representing the static structure, rather than dynamic aspects, of the human form.","This region is thought to hold a human body representation (Downing et al., 2001) as well as a dynamic action representation (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2006) that may have contributed to both imagery creation and static movement creation.","['Our fMRI data showed that the spatial-praxis and emotional imagery tasks shared activations in orbitofrontal cortex, middle temporal regions and  occipital cortex.', 'The orbitofrontal cortex has often been linked to sensory integration, in representing the affective value of reinforcers, and in decisionmaking and expectation (Kringelbach, 2005).', 'Common brain activations in middle temporal regions may reflect perceptual expertise responses usually associated with the nearby extrastriate cortex.', 'This region is thought to hold a human body representation (Downing et al., 2001) as well as a dynamic action representation (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2006) that may have contributed to both imagery creation and static movement creation.', 'Spatial-praxis imagery creation showed additional activation in the premotor and parietal cortices suggesting that sensorimotor representations were being used, even though motor behaviour was not being explicitly imagined.', 'Although based on a single dancer, our results are nonetheless in broad agreement with previous motor imagery studies (Iacoboni et al., 1999;Gr��zes and Decety, 2001;Calvo-Merino et al., 2005).', 'The activity related to static movement creation showed a very similar pattern of activity to the imagery creation tasks, showing how important imagery creation is in movement creation.', 'Analysis of the peak coordinates indicated that brain regions participating here were the same as those in studies where expert dancers watch familiar dance movements (Calvo-Merino et al., 2005).', 'The only major difference found between movement creation and imagery creation was an increased activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus, which has been associated with representations of goal directed actions in movement observation and execution (Iacoboni et al., 1999).', 'Moreover, this area has also been related to inhibition of prepotent responses (Christopoulos, Tobler, Bossaerts et al., 2009), but also in the multiple-demand network (Duncan, 2010), which is activated by many different cognitive demands including perceptual difficulty, novelty, and response conflict.', 'While it is possible that this activity reflects the novelty for our dancer of creating movement while remaining stationary, and having to inhibit her own movement, it could also reflect the need to synthesise different and novel ideas about movement to complete the movement creation task, as the subjective reports from Experiment 1 suggested.', 'While these data do provide some general support for the idea that both imagery and movement creation tasks are grounded in some elements of physical or action based thinking, they also raise some key questions concerning the wider mental context in which such thinking occurs and, given the clear limitations of the current fMRI and experience sampling work, how future research might usefully be directed.', ""The variety of strategies adopted within each task by our very creative dancer, which prevented our direct comparison of spatial-praxic and emotional movement creation tasks, also shows that it is necessary either to impose clearer constraints upon the experimental tasks (e.g., to adopt a first-person perspective for one's own dance, rather than a third-person perspective of other dancers), or if time and resources allow, to collect data from several runs in order to maximize task specific variations in relation to general variation in brain activity."", 'An interesting illustration of how our findings might be further pursued concerns creativity.', 'The neuroscience literature has given rise to considerable speculation concerning the role in creativity of the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral frontal areas implicated here in imagery and movement creation.', 'For example, Jung et al.

Cross"", ""Antonia F. de C. Hamilton"", ""Scott T. Grafton""]","Research on action simulation identifies brain areas that are active while imagining or performing simple overlearned actions. Are areas engaged during imagined movement sensitive to the amount of actual physical practice? In the present study, participants were expert dancers who learned and rehearsed novel, complex whole-body dance sequences 5 h a week across 5 weeks. Brain activity was recorded weekly by fMRI as dancers observed and imagined performing different movement sequences. Half these sequences were rehearsed and half were unpracticed control movements. After each trial, participants rated how well they could perform the movement. We hypothesized that activity in premotor areas would increase as participants observed and simulated movements that they had learnt outside the scanner. Dancers' ratings of their ability to perform rehearsed sequences, but not the control sequences, increased with training. When dancers observed and simulated another dancer's movements, brain regions classically associated with both action simulation and action observation were active, including inferior parietal lobule, cingulate and supplementary motor areas, ventral premotor cortex, superior temporal sulcus and primary motor cortex. Critically, inferior parietal lobule and ventral premotor activity was modulated as a function of dancers' ratings of their own ability to perform the observed movements and their motor experience. These data demonstrate that a complex motor resonance can be built de novo over 5 weeks of rehearsal. Furthermore, activity in premotor and parietal areas during action simulation is enhanced by the ability to execute a learned action irrespective of stimulus familiarity or semantic label.","Some studies have made use of the motor expertise model to investigate the link between the action execution and action perception network (Calvo-Merino et al., 2005;Calvo-Merino et al., 2006;Orgs et al., 2008) and motor learning (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2006).","['Cognitive neuroscience research has also investigated the neural mechanisms of motor imagery in the control of action (e.g.', 'see deLange, Roelofs & Toni, 2008).', 'In the same way that visual imagery and visual perception recruit similar brain regions (Ganis et al., 2004), several studies have shown that during imagination of a movement, the same sensorimotor regions are activated as when we observe a movement or actually execute it ourselves (Decety et al., 1994;Gr��zes & Decety, 2001).', 'Some studies have made use of the motor expertise model to investigate the link between the action execution and action perception network (Calvo-Merino et al., 2005;Calvo-Merino et al., 2006;Orgs et al., 2008) and motor learning (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2006).', 'Other studies have focused on the underlying neural mechanisms of creativity in realms other than dance (Jung et al., 2010), especially in music (Limb and Braun, 2008) and drawing (Bhattacharya & Petsche, 2005).', ""The bulk of these studies have been based upon the researchers' expectations concerning motor responses, rather than seeking to correlate activity with subjective reports of motor imagery, so while they have focused upon motor or movement related brain processes, wide ranging networks are implicated and the possible involvement of multiple forms of imagery in such tasks remains to be clarified.""]",0,"['Some studies have made use of the motor expertise model to investigate the link between the action execution and action perception network (Calvo-Merino et al., 2005;Calvo-Merino et al., 2006;Orgs et al., 2008) and motor learning (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2006).', 'Other studies have focused on the underlying neural mechanisms of creativity in realms other than dance (Jung et al., 2010), especially in music (Limb and Braun, 2008) and drawing (Bhattacharya & Petsche, 2005).']"

Economic decision theory suggests that value, risk, and risk aversion influence choice behavior. Although previous studies identified neural correlates of decision parameters, the contribution of these correlates to actual choices is unknown. In two different experiments, participants chose between risky and safe options. We identified discrete blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) correlates of value and risk in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate, respectively. Notably, increasing inferior frontal gyrus activity to low risk and safe options correlated with higher risk aversion. Importantly, the combination of these BOLD responses effectively decoded the behavioral choice. Striatal value and cingulate risk responses increased the probability of a risky choice, whereas inferior frontal gyrus responses showed the inverse relationship. These findings suggest that the BOLD correlates of decision factors are appropriate for an ideal observer to detect behavioral choices.

Such antecedents may include cognitions, environmental stimuli, social interactions, and affective states. Current ED theories suggest that the relationships between antecedents and eating behavior may be complex, including interaction associations, time-lagged effects, and associations that persist only for brief periods of time. Similarly, these theories often include the consequences of behavior-influencing variables of interest (e.g., short-term reductions in negative affect). Careful examination of such theories, however, has been limited by a reliance on data collection methods not appropriate for testing these effects. Method: This study examines alternative methods for data collection and analysis that overcome previously noted limitations, using data collected in several studies with eating-disordered participants. Results: The development of a technique called ecological momentary assessment (EMA) allows the ongoing study of behavior in its natural context and reduces biases associated with retrospective recall. The development of technology that allows the sophisticated collection and storage of such data (e.g., palm-top computers), along with statistical procedures for analyzing hierarchically nested, repeated measures data, allow precise testing of complex theoretical models. Discussion: We demonstrate several important features of this research: (1) patients are willing and able to engage in EMA studies, (2) data not possible to collect using other designs are obtainable, (3) complex theoretical models can be evaluated using these data and appropriate statistical methods, and (4) the collection and analysis of EMA data present unique difficulties to ED researchers.

Semantic search promises to produce precise answers to user queries by taking advantage of the availability of explicit semantics of information in the context of the semantic web. Existing tools have been primarily designed to enhance the performance of traditional search technologies but with little support for naive users, i.e., ordinary end users who are not necessarily familiar with domain specific semantic data, ontologies, or SQL-like query languages. This paper presents SemSearch, a search engine, which pays special attention to this issue by hiding the complexity of semantic search from end users and making it easy to use and effective. In contrast with existing semantic-based keyword search engines which typically compromise their capability of handling complex user queries in order to overcome the problem of knowledge overhead, SemSearch not only overcomes the problem of knowledge overhead but also supports complex queries. Further, SemSearch provides comprehensive means to produce precise answers that on the one hand satisfy user queries and on the other hand are self-explanatory and understandable by end users. A prototype of the search engine has been implemented and applied in the semantic web portal of our lab.

Natural language interfaces offer end-users a familiar and convenient option for querying ontology-based knowledge bases. Several studies have shown that they can achieve high retrieval performance as well as domain independence. This paper focuses on usability and investigates if NLIs are useful from an end-user's point of view. To that end, we introduce four interfaces each allowing a different query language and present a usability study benchmarking these interfaces. The results of the study reveal a clear preference for full sentences as query language and confirm that NLIs are useful for querying Semantic Web data.","Kaufmann [11,#AUTHOR_TAG] chose the Mooney dataset (see Sec. 5.2) as the ontological knowledge base for this study, since they include geographical domain knowledge about the USA which provides a simple, well-known, easily understandable and limited area which enables casual end-users to pose questions quickly; additionally, a large predefined set of natural language test questions was already available.","['Kaufmann [11,#AUTHOR_TAG] chose the Mooney dataset (see Sec. 5.2) as the ontological knowledge base for this study, since they include geographical domain knowledge about the USA which provides a simple, well-known, easily understandable and limited area which enables casual end-users to pose questions quickly; additionally, a large predefined set of natural language test questions was already available.', 'Furthermore, its use allowed the possibility of making the findings comparable with other evaluations of tools in this area, such as Cocktail [18], PANTO [17] and PRECISE [17].']",2,"['Kaufmann [11,#AUTHOR_TAG] chose the Mooney dataset (see Sec. 5.2) as the ontological knowledge base for this study, since they include geographical domain knowledge about the USA which provides a simple, well-known, easily understandable and limited area which enables casual end-users to pose questions quickly; additionally, a large predefined set of natural language test questions was already available.']"

Each ACE query is translated into a discourse representation structure - a variant of the language of first-order logic - that is then translated into an N3-based semantic web querying language using an ontology-based rewriting framework. As the validation shows, our approach offers great potential for bridging the gap between the logic-based semantic web and its real-world users, since it allows users to query the semantic web without having to learn an unfamiliar formal language. Furthermore, we found that users liked our approach and designed good queries resulting in a very good retrieval performance (100 % precision and 90 % recall).","Searching the Semantic Web lies at the core of many activities that are envisioned for the Semantic Web; many researchers have investigated means for indexing and searching the Semantic Web [1][2]#AUTHOR_TAG[4]6,9,13,14,16].

Yet NLIs are only usable if they map natural language questions to SQL queries correctly. We introduce the Precise NLI [2], which reduces the semantic interpretation challenge in NLIs to a graph matching problem. Precise uses the max-flow algorithm to efficiently solve this problem. Each max-flow solution corresponds to a possible semantic interpretation of the sentence. precise collects max-flow solutions, discards the solutions that do not obey syntactic constraints and retains the rest as the basis for generating SQL queries corresponding to the question q. The syntactic information is extracted from the parse tree corresponding to the given question which is computed by a statistical parser [1]. For a broad, well-defined class of semantically tractable natural language questions, Precise is guaranteed to map each question to the corresponding SQL querySemantically tractable questions correspond to a natural, domain-independent subset of English that can be efficiently and accurately interpreted as nonrecursive Datalog clauses. Precise is transportable to arbitrary databases, such as the Restaurants,Jobs and Geography databases used in our implementation. Examples of semantically tractable questions include: ""What Chinese restaurants with a 3.5 rating are in Seattle?"", ""What are the areas of US states with large populations?"", ""What jobs require 4 years of experience and desire a B.S.CS degree?"".Given a question which is not semantically tractable, Precise recognizes it as such and informs the user that it cannot answer it.Given a semantically tractable question, Precise computes the set of non-equivalent SQL interpretations corresponding to the question. If a unique such SQL interpretation exists, Precise outputs it together with the corresponding result set obtained by querying the current database. If the set contains more than one SQL interpretation, the natural language question is ambiguous in the context of the current database. In this case, Precise asks for the user's help in determining which interpretation is the correct one.Our experiments have shown that Precise has high coverage and accuracy over common English questions. In future work, we plan to explore increasingly broad classes of questions and include Precise as a module in a full-fledged dialog system. An important direction for future work is helping users understand the types of questions Precise cannot handle via dialog, enabling them to build an accurate mental model of the system and its capabilities. Also, our own group's work on the EXACT natural language interface [3] builds on Precise and on the underlying theoretical framework.

This, in turn, means that there are no absolute measures of usability, since, if the usability of an artefact is defined by the context in which that artefact is used, measures of usability must of necessity be defined by that context too. Despite this, there is a need for broad general measures which can be used to compare usability across a range of contexts. In addition, there is a need for ""quick and dirty "" methods to allow low cost assessments of usability in industrial systems evaluation. This chapter describes the System Usability Scale (SUS) a reliable, low-cost usability scale that can be used for global assessments of systems usability. Usability and context Usability is not a quality that exists in any real or absolute sense. Perhaps it can be best summed up as being a general quality of the appropriateness to a purpose of any particular artefact. This notion is neatly summed up by Terry Pratchett in his novel ""Moving Pictures"": ""  'Well, at least he keeps himself fit, ' said the Archchancellor nastily. 'Not like the rest of you fellows. I went into the Uncommon Room this morning and it was full of chaps snoring!' 'That would be the senior masters, Master, ' said the Bursar. 'I would say they are supremely fit, myself.' 'Fit? The Dean looks like a man who's swallered a bed!' 'Ah, but Master, ' said the Bursar, smiling indulgently, 'the word ""fit"",as I understand it, means ""appropriate to a purpose"", and I would say that the body of the Dean is supremely appropriate to the purpose of sitting around all day and eating big heavy meals. ' The Dean permitted himself a little smile. "" (Pratchett, 1990) In just the same way, the usability of any tool or system has to be viewed in terms of the context in which it is used, and its appropriateness to that context.

The casual user is typically overwhelmed by the formal logic of the Semantic Web. The gap between the end user and the logic-based scaffolding has to be bridged if the Semantic Web's capabilities are to be utilized by the general public. This paper proposes that controlled natural languages offer one way to bridge the gap. We introduce GINO, a guided input natural language ontology editor that allows users to edit and query ontologies in a language akin to English. It uses a small static grammar, which it dynamically extends with elements from the loaded ontologies. The usability evaluation shows that GINO is well-suited for novice users when editing ontologies. We believe that the use of guided entry overcomes the habitability problem, which adversely affects most natural language systems. Additionally, the approach's dynamic gram-mar generation allows for easy adaptation to new ontologies.","Searching the Semantic Web lies at the core of many activities that are envisioned for the Semantic Web; many researchers have investigated means for indexing and searching the Semantic Web #AUTHOR_TAG[2][3][4]6,9,13,14,16].

Histopathologic grading of acute inflammation with the acute inflammatory score (AIS) (on the basis of mucosal ulceration, edema, and quantity and depth of neutrophilic infiltration) and the degree of fibrostenosis was performed at each site, and results were compared with MR imaging features. Data were analyzed by using linear regression with robust standard errors of the estimate.AIS was positively correlated with mural thickness and mural/CSF signal intensity ratio on T2-weighted fat-saturated images (P < .001 and P = .003, respectively) but not with mural enhancement at 30 and 70 seconds (P = .50 and P = .73, respectively). AIS was higher with layered mural enhancement (P < .001), a pattern also commonly associated with coexisting fibrostenosis (75%). Mural/CSF signal intensity ratio on T2-weighted fat-saturated images was higher in histologically edematous bowel than in nonedematous bowel (P = .04).

Methods: MRE of 95 consecutive pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) examined in 2006-2009 were retrospectively analyzed, with documentation of findings based on type and location of the small bowel (SB) disease. Results: In all, 51 were boys and 44 girls. 54 had CD, 31 non-CD IBD, and 10 no IBD. The most common site of SB involvement in CD was the terminal ileum seen in 29 (53.7%) patients, followed by ileum in 10 (18.5%) and jejunum in 9 (16.7%) patients. Solitary jejunal inflammation (3.7%), SB stenoses (1.9%), fistula formation (0.95%), and abscess (0.95%) were much less common. Perienteric lymphadenopathy was seen in 30 (55.6%) patients and fatty proliferation in 9 (16.7%). The most common manifestation of SB inflammation was increased contrast enhancement of bowel wall (93.5%), thickening of the bowel wall (90.3%), and derangement of bowel shape with saccular formations (25.8%). Conclusions: MRE in the pediatric population often demonstrates increased contrast uptake, bowel wall thickening, and perienteral lymphadenopathy in CD.

These generalizations are algebraic structures in which the two entries Lie bracket has been replaced by a bracket with n entries. Each type of n-ary bracket satisfies a specific characteristic identity which plays the r\^ole of the Jacobi identity for Lie algebras. Particular attention will be paid to generalized Lie algebras, which are defined by even multibrackets obtained by antisymmetrizing the associative products of its n components and that satisfy the generalized Jacobi identity (GJI), and to Filippov (or n-Lie) algebras, which are defined by fully antisymmetric n-brackets that satisfy the Filippov identity (FI). Three-Lie algebras have surfaced recently in multi-brane theory in the context of the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson model. Because of this, Filippov algebras will be discussed at length, including the cohomology complexes that govern their central extensions and their deformations (Whitehead's lemma extends to all semisimple n-Lie algebras). When the skewsymmetry of the n-Lie algebra is relaxed, one is led the n-Leibniz algebras. These will be discussed as well, since they underlie the cohomological properties of n-Lie algebras.   The standard Poisson structure may also be extended to the n-ary case. We shall review here the even generalized Poisson structures, whose GJI reproduces the pattern of the generalized Lie algebras, and the Nambu-Poisson structures, which satisfy the FI and determine Filippov algebras. Finally, the recent work of Bagger-Lambert and Gustavsson on superconformal Chern-Simons theory will be briefly discussed. Emphasis will be made on the appearance of the 3-Lie algebra structure and on why the A_4 model may be formulated in terms of an ordinary Lie algebra, and on its Nambu bracket generalization.Comment: Invited topical review for JPA Math.Theor. v2: minor changes,   references added. 120 pages, 318 reference","Its appearance in Physics was due to the pioneering work of Nambu [4], and more recently, the work of Bagger and Lambert [5] renewed interest in ternary algebras in the Theoretical Physics community (see also the review article #AUTHOR_TAG).","['The subject of ternary algebras, a special case of n-Lie algebras is generally attributed to Fillipov [1], but Filippov was following up on earlier studies that had appeared in the mathematics literature, primarily by Kurosh [2] (as remarked in [3]).', 'Its appearance in Physics was due to the pioneering work of Nambu [4], and more recently, the work of Bagger and Lambert [5] renewed interest in ternary algebras in the Theoretical Physics community (see also the review article #AUTHOR_TAG).', 'In general, a Ternary Bracket is a composition law for three operators, which is completely antisymmetric in the three operators; as for example Nambu Brackets, which are an extension of the idea of Poisson Brackets to three functions.', 'In this article we study the purely algebraic structure of the algebra, with a product structure for the operators clearly in mind, and we refer to such brackets as ternutators.']",0,"['The subject of ternary algebras, a special case of n-Lie algebras is generally attributed to Fillipov [1], but Filippov was following up on earlier studies that had appeared in the mathematics literature, primarily by Kurosh [2] (as remarked in [3]).', 'Its appearance in Physics was due to the pioneering work of Nambu [4], and more recently, the work of Bagger and Lambert [5] renewed interest in ternary algebras in the Theoretical Physics community (see also the review article #AUTHOR_TAG).', 'In general, a Ternary Bracket is a composition law for three operators, which is completely antisymmetric in the three operators; as for example Nambu Brackets, which are an extension of the idea of Poisson Brackets to three functions.', 'In this article we study the purely algebraic structure of the algebra, with a product structure for the operators clearly in mind, and we refer to such brackets as ternutators.']"
CC1029,9551787,Renewing the Link between Cognitive Archeology and Cognitive Science,Chris Thornton,Reconstructing the Cognitive World The Next Step,"[""Michael Wheeler""]","In Reconstructing the Cognitive World, Michael Wheeler argues that we should turn away from the generically Cartesian philosophical foundations of much contemporary cognitive science research and proposes instead a Heideggerian approach. Wheeler begins with an interpretation of Descartes. He defines Cartesian psychology as a conceptual framework of explanatory principles and shows how each of these principles is part of the deep assumptions of orthodox cognitive science (both classical and connectionist). Wheeler then turns to Heidegger's radically non-Cartesian account of everyday cognition, which, he argues, can be used to articulate the philosophical foundations of a genuinely non-Cartesian cognitive science. Finding that Heidegger's critique of Cartesian thinking falls short, even when supported by Hubert Dreyfus's influential critique of orthodox artificial intelligence, Wheeler suggests a new Heideggerian approach. He points to recent research in ""embodied-embedded"" cognitive science and proposes a Heideggerian framework to identify, amplify, and clarify the underlying philosophical foundations of this new work. He focuses much of his investigation on recent work in artificial intelligence-oriented robotics, discussing, among other topics, the nature and status of representational explanation, and whether (and to what extent) cognition is computation rather than a noncomputational phenomenon best described in the language of dynamical systems theory. Wheeler's argument draws on analytic philosophy, continental philosophy, and empirical work to ""reconstruct"" the philosophical foundations of cognitive science in a time of a fundamental shift away from a generically Cartesian approach. His analysis demonstrates that Heideggerian continental philosophy and naturalistic cognitive science need not be mutually exclusive and shows further that a Heideggerian framework can act as the ""conceptual glue"" for new work in cognitive science.","Indeed, they are often seen to be philosophically flawed (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2005).","['Conceptions of cognition in which symbolic reasoning takes charge are increasingly questioned (Thelen and Smith, 1993;Ballard, 1991).', 'Indeed, they are often seen to be philosophically flawed (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2005).', 'The essence of the charge is that they are ideomorphic, i.e., dependent on conceptual projection.', 'Where a set of ideas are found to deal effectively with the behaviour of a system, there is the temptation to assume they must pick out physical or functional constituents.', 'In practice, there may be no correlation whatsoever.', 'Yet any such scheme will seem to be explanatory purely as a result of the deployment of familiar concepts.']",0,"['Conceptions of cognition in which symbolic reasoning takes charge are increasingly questioned (Thelen and Smith, 1993;Ballard, 1991).', 'Indeed, they are often seen to be philosophically flawed (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2005).', 'The essence of the charge is that they are ideomorphic, i.e., dependent on conceptual projection.', 'Where a set of ideas are found to deal effectively with the behaviour of a system, there is the temptation to assume they must pick out physical or functional constituents.', 'In practice, there may be no correlation whatsoever.', 'Yet any such scheme will seem to be explanatory purely as a result of the deployment of familiar concepts.']"

We need to make explicit reference to past cognition when interpreting the archaeological record and to draw inferences from that data concerning ancient minds . Did, for instance, Homo habilis have language, Homo erectus self-awareness or Neanderthals the capacity for analogical reasoning? While fossil endocasts may inform about brain structure, the character of past cognition must be largely inferred from the archaeological record. And to draw such inferences archaeologists need to engage with, or rather become participants in, the cognitive sciences - just as Bloch (1991) has recently argued for anthropology. This is essential since we cannot pretend to understand the ancient mind without entering debates concerning the character of the modern mind. In this paper I focus on one of these debates, that concerning whether the mind is a general purpose learning mechanism or composed of a series of relatively independent mental modules - psychological mechanisms dedicated to specific tasks or behavioural domains. My review of this debate suggests that a major feature of human cognitive evolution has been increased accessibility between mental modules resulting in a generalized intelligence, though one remaining within a modular architecture. I consider whether the Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transition may have constituted a phase in human evolution during which there was a significant development from domain specific to generalized intelligence.","In this theory (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1993), the domain-specific entities are understood to be specialized intelligences, along the lines of (Gardner, 1993).","[""Prominent among accounts of this type is Mithen's 'cathedral' model."", 'In this theory (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1993), the domain-specific entities are understood to be specialized intelligences, along the lines of (Gardner, 1993).', ""Seeing these as broadly analogous to the chapels of a cathedral, Mithen equates general intelligence with the cathedral's nave."", 'It is a central area through which the multiple intelligences come to be connected.', 'The ultimate effect is a unified, cognitively fluid system of general intelligence (Mithen, 1996b, p. 72).']",0,"['In this theory (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1993), the domain-specific entities are understood to be specialized intelligences, along the lines of (Gardner, 1993).', ""Seeing these as broadly analogous to the chapels of a cathedral, Mithen equates general intelligence with the cathedral's nave.""]"

The performance of a series of codes is evaluated by, as the block lengths approach infinity, whether their error probabilities decay to zero, whether their rates converge to capacity, and whether their growth in complexities stays under control. Over any discrete memoryless channel, I build codes such that: (1) their error probabilities and rates scale like random codes; and (2) their en/decoding complexities scale like polar codes. Quantitatively, for any constants $p,r>0$ s.t. $p+2r0$ s.t. $2r<1$, I construct a series of codes with block length $N$ approaching infinity, error probability $\exp(-(\log N)^t)$, rate $N^{-r}$ less than the capacity, and en/decoding complexity $O(N\log(\log N))$ per block. The two aforementioned results are built upon two pillars: a versatile framework that generates codes on the basis of channel polarization, and a calculus-probability machinery that evaluates the performances of codes. The framework that generates codes and the machinery that evaluates codes can be extended to many other scenarios in network information theory.

Here, they are labelled Types 1 and 2, and their characteristics are outlined. This discussion creates a more than usually rigorous perspective of the subject, from which past work and future prospects are briefly reviewed. Artificial Intelligence is the study of complex information processing problems that often have their roots in some aspect of biological information processing. The goal of the subject is to identify interesting and solvable information processing problems, and solve them. The solution to an information processing problem divides naturally into two parts. In the first, the underlying nature of a particular computation is characterized, and its basis in the physical world is understood. One can think of this part as an abstract formulation of what is being computed and why, and I shall refer to it as the &amp;quot;theory &amp;quot; of a computation. The second part consists of particular algorithms for implementing a computation, and so it specifies how. The choice of algorithm usually depends upon the hardware in which the process is to run, and there may be many algorithms that implement the same computation. The theory of a com-putation, on the other hand, depends only on the nature of the problem to which it is a solution.

Beginning with their own research in motor, perceptual, and cognitive development, Thelen and Smith raise fundamental questions about prevailing assumptions in the field. They propose a new theory of the development of cognition and action, unifying recent advances in dynamic systems theory with current research in neuroscience and neural development. In particular, they show how by processes of exploration and selection, multimodal experiences form the bases for self-organizing perception-action categories. Thelen and Smith offer a radical alternative to current cognitive theory, both in their emphasis on dynamic representation and in their focus on processes of change. Among the first attempt to apply complexity theory to psychology, they suggest reinterpretations of several classic issues in early cognitive development. The book is divided into three sections. The first discusses the nature of developmental processes in general terms, the second covers dynamic principles in process and mechanism, and the third looks at how a dynamic theory can be applied to enduring puzzles of development.","Conceptions of cognition in which symbolic reasoning takes charge are increasingly questioned (#AUTHOR_TAG and Smith, 1993;Ballard, 1991).","['Conceptions of cognition in which symbolic reasoning takes charge are increasingly questioned (#AUTHOR_TAG and Smith, 1993;Ballard, 1991).', 'Indeed, they are often seen to be philosophically flawed (Wheeler, 2005).', 'The essence of the charge is that they are ideomorphic, i.e., dependent on conceptual projection.', 'Where a set of ideas are found to deal effectively with the behaviour of a system, there is the temptation to assume they must pick out physical or functional constituents.', 'In practice, there may be no correlation whatsoever.', 'Yet any such scheme will seem to be explanatory purely as a result of the deployment of familiar concepts.']",0,"['Conceptions of cognition in which symbolic reasoning takes charge are increasingly questioned (#AUTHOR_TAG and Smith, 1993;Ballard, 1991).']"

To fulfil this aim, standard cognitive neuropsychological tests and experimental paradigms have been applied in an intensive series of measurements, consisting five sessions. Each of the cognitive functionings in focus (complex, verbalised naive theory of mind, executive functions and working memory) were measured repeatedly within and across these sessions, with various measure tools (2-3 times per specific tool). A test group of high functioning young adults with autism spectrum disorder (N=20) and a neurotypical control group (N=20) were matched along age, sex and IQ. A group of developmental controls (neurotypical adolescents, N=10) was also involved, in order to control if patterns of stability in the autism group mirror delayed maturation of these cognitive skills, or a qualitatively atypical pattern. Although more complex and fine-grained analyses are still in progress, preliminary findings suggest that short-term cognitive instability may be a relevant factor in the understanding of autism spectrum conditions; the autism spectrum appears to be heterogeneous in terms of short-term cognitive stability/instability, and repeated measurements show patterns of performance partly different from those observed in both of the control groups",(This might be in the manner envisaged by #AUTHOR_TAG (2002).),"['The proposal does not dispute the salience of a symbolic style of thought.', 'It contends only that symbolism is on a continuum.', ""Instead of there being a rigid distinction between 'what is symbolic' and 'what is not symbolic', concepts are seen to become relatively more symbolic, as they become more abstract, more precisely defined and more broad in generalization."", 'The proposal also does not intend to downplay the potential significance of language.', ""As Tattersall comments 'it's as certain as anything inferential can be that language and the mental abilities directly associated with it loom large indeed behind the capacity to think, on which our species' success is founded (Tattersall, 1998, p. 227)."", 'Nothing in the present proposal contradicts that idea.', 'Taking the transition to symbolic thought to involve information-oriented generalization is in no way inconsistent with evolution of language being intertwined.', '(This might be in the manner envisaged by #AUTHOR_TAG (2002).)', 'It is more a functional reduction of the mechanisms assumed to mediate the process.']",0,"['(This might be in the manner envisaged by #AUTHOR_TAG (2002).)', 'It is more a functional reduction of the mechanisms assumed to mediate the process.']"

We support this thought and also propose that utilizing that the world is rich on information is essential. We develop this idea to show how attention and figure-ground segmentation by an active observer using multiple cues can be separated from analyzing and recognizing what is seen in a consistent way. Continuous operation over time and early use of three dimensional cues are important in this context.

Most of this debate has been over the empirical record for the appearance and distribution of a set of traits that have come to be accepted as indicators of behavioral modernity. This debate has resulted in a series of competing models that we explicate here, and the traits are typically used as the test implications for these models. However, adequate tests of hypotheses and models rest on robust test implications, and we argue here that the current set of test implications suffers from three main problems: (1) Many are empirically derived from and context-specific to the richer European record, rendering them problematic for use in the primarily tropical and subtropical African continent. (2) They are ambiguous because other processes can be invoked, often with greater parsimony, to explain their character. (3) Many lack theoretical justification.

CC1053,9551787,Renewing the Link between Cognitive Archeology and Cognitive Science,Chris Thornton,"Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference, and Consciousness","[""P Johnson-Laird""]","Excerpts available on Google Books.Mental Models offers nothing less than a unified theory of the major properties of mind: comprehension, inference, and consciousness. In spirited and graceful prose, Johnson-Laird argues that we apprehend the world by building inner mental replicas of the relations among objects and events that concern us. The mind is essentially a model-building device that can itself be modeled on a digital computer. This book provides both a blueprint for building such a model and numerous important illustrations of how to do it. In several key areas of cognition, Johnson-Laird shows how an explanation based on mental modeling is clearly superior to previous theory. For example, he argues compellingly that deductive reasoning does not take place by tacitly applying the rules of logic, but by mentally manipulating models of the states of affairs from which inferences are drawn. Similarly, linguistic comprehension is best understood not as a matter of applying inference rules to propositions derived from sentences, but rather as the mind's effort to construct and update a model of the situation described by a text or a discourse. Most provocative, perhaps, is Johnson-Laird's theory of consciousness: the mind's necessarily incomplete model of itself allows only a partial control over the many unconscious and parallel processes of cognition. This an extraordinarily rich book, providing a coherent account of much recent experimental work in cognitive psychology, along with lucid explanations of relevant theory in linguistics, computer science, and philosophy Not since Miller, Galanter, and Pribram's classic Plans and the Structure of Behavior has a book in cognitive science combined such sweep, style, and good sense. Like its distinguished predecessor, Mental Models may well serve to fix a point of view for a generation.

Health professionals working with specific patient groups are often aware of these difficulties and their detrimental effect on quality of life and wellbeing. However, many health professionals lack knowledge and skills on how to support patients, either within the team or via referral to relevant service providers who have expertise in managing appearance-related distress. This is mainly owing to a lack of information about screening, assessment measures and available interventions. The aim of this article is to consider how health professionals can support patients who experience distress as a result of living with a long-term physical health condition that has altered their appearance. This article summarises the challenges for patients and health professionals surrounding body image, altered appearance and associated distress. Gaps in relation to screening measures, differing types of intervention, appearance-related skills training for healthcare teams, care pathways and access to services are identified. A summary of the limited range of interventions currently available has been mapped onto a stepped model of care, ranging from self-help to intensive therapies. Finally, readers are pointed to helpful resources for understanding, identifying, addressing and signposting patients with appearance-related distress.","The resultant psychological distress and dysfunction associated with visible differences associated with disease, traumatic injury and congenital and developmental abnormality has similarly been increasingly documented over recent years (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012b).","['The subjective experience of living with a different appearance has been well reported.', 'Visibly different people are subject to staring and unwelcome attention, avoidance, through to overt teasing, hostility and rejection (e.g., MacGregor et al., 1953;Lansdown et al., 1997;Bundy, 2012).', 'The resultant psychological distress and dysfunction associated with visible differences associated with disease, traumatic injury and congenital and developmental abnormality has similarly been increasingly documented over recent years (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012b).', 'Difficulties reported include social avoidance, fear of negative evaluation, shame, and anxiety (Rosser, Moss & Rumsey, 2010).', 'Applied psychologists, including health, clinical, and counseling psychologists have been at the forefront of developing interventions to support people with psychological needs arising from visible differences (Bessell et al., 2012a;Bessell et al., 2012b), and in developing a clearer understanding of the differentiating factors and processes between those who adjust well, and those who struggle to cope and manage with differing appearances.', 'It is clear that the objective severity of appearance differences has little impact on the psychological adjustment to visible differences (Moss, 2005).', 'The underlying processes which do mediate and moderate individual differences in adjustment include the perception and use of social support, the availability of negative self views within the self-concept, and attentional biases towards appearance related information in the external environment (cf.', 'Moss & Rosser, 2012).', 'Within the literature on body image in the wider population, the tripartite influence model of adjustment highlights the social impacts of peers, family and the media on body image, including the internalization of social ideals about appearance, and engagement in social comparison processes (Thompson et al., 1999).', 'An extensive literature exists based on these predictors, the relationships between them and identifying factors which intervene between these predictors, psychosocial outcomes, and appearance related behaviours.']",0,"['The subjective experience of living with a different appearance has been well reported.', 'Visibly different people are subject to staring and unwelcome attention, avoidance, through to overt teasing, hostility and rejection (e.g., MacGregor et al., 1953;Lansdown et al., 1997;Bundy, 2012).', 'The resultant psychological distress and dysfunction associated with visible differences associated with disease, traumatic injury and congenital and developmental abnormality has similarly been increasingly documented over recent years (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012b).', 'Difficulties reported include social avoidance, fear of negative evaluation, shame, and anxiety (Rosser, Moss & Rumsey, 2010).', 'Applied psychologists, including health, clinical, and counseling psychologists have been at the forefront of developing interventions to support people with psychological needs arising from visible differences (Bessell et al., 2012a;Bessell et al., 2012b), and in developing a clearer understanding of the differentiating factors and processes between those who adjust well, and those who struggle to cope and manage with differing appearances.', 'It is clear that the objective severity of appearance differences has little impact on the psychological adjustment to visible differences (Moss, 2005).', 'The underlying processes which do mediate and moderate individual differences in adjustment include the perception and use of social support, the availability of negative self views within the self-concept, and attentional biases towards appearance related information in the external environment (cf.', 'Moss & Rosser, 2012).', 'Within the literature on body image in the wider population, the tripartite influence model of adjustment highlights the social impacts of peers, family and the media on body image, including the internalization of social ideals about appearance, and engagement in social comparison processes (Thompson et al., 1999).', 'An extensive literature exists based on these predictors, the relationships between them and identifying factors which intervene between these predictors, psychosocial outcomes, and appearance related behaviours.']"

There is dearth of literature regarding the quality of sexual life after burn as well as sexual rehabilitation; it is fully known that a healthy sexual life is intricately related to a person's mental well being and a sexually compromised person can never be totally happy. The objective of this study was to ascertain the degree of satisfaction in postburn patients regarding their sexual lives, parameters associated with sexual dissatisfaction, if present, and ways to address the same. Quality of sexual life was investigated by making burn patients answer the Maudsley Marital Questionnaire (the sexual scale only) 6 months after burn. A control group of nonburn patients matched with the cases was made to answer the same and values were compared for significance. Results of the Maudsley Marital Questionnaire sexual scale were obtained for both groups and compared by means of a kh test (Pearson).

Lee""]","The goal of this book is to foster a basic understanding of factor analytic techniques so that readers can use them in their own research and critically evaluate their use by other researchers. Both the underlying theory and correct application are emphasized. The theory is presented through the mathematical basis of the most common factor analytic models and several methods used in factor analysis. On the application side, considerable attention is given to the extraction problem, the rotation problem, and the interpretation of factor analytic results. Hence, readers are given a background of understanding in the the theory underlying factor analysis and then taken through the steps in executing a proper analysis -- from the initial problem of design through choice of correlation coefficient, factor extraction, factor rotation, factor interpretation, and writing up results. This revised edition includes introductions to newer methods -- such as confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling -- that have revolutionized factor analysis in recent years. To help remove some of the mystery underlying these newer, more complex methods, the introductory examples utilize EQS and LISREL. Updated material relating to the validation of the Comrey Personality Scales also has been added. Finally, program disks for running factor analyses on either an IBM-compatible PC or a mainframe with FORTRAN capabilities are available. The intended audience for this volume includes talented but mathematically unsophisticated advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and research workers seeking to acquire a basic understanding of the principles supporting factor analysis.","Sample size was based on recommendations by Comrey and Lee on minimum sample size in factor analysis (#AUTHOR_TAG & Lee, 1992).","['Sample size was based on recommendations by Comrey and Lee on minimum sample size in factor analysis (#AUTHOR_TAG & Lee, 1992).', 'They indicate that more than 500 is very good, whilst 1,000 or more observations is excellent.', 'For the current study, increasing sample sizes beyond 1,000 served to enhance power and provided the opportunity to obtain a wide sample over multiple clinical groupings.']",5,"['Sample size was based on recommendations by Comrey and Lee on minimum sample size in factor analysis (#AUTHOR_TAG & Lee, 1992).']"

Results based on self-report measures of these constructs suggested that body shame and body self-consciousness during sexual activity were negatively correlated with sexual satisfaction. Additionally, path analysis indicated that body surveillance predicted increased body self-consciousness during sexual activity, partially mediated by body shame.

Bentler""]","Normed and nonnormed fit indexes are frequently used as adjuncts to chi-square statistics for evaluating the fit of a structural model. A drawback of existing indexes is that they estimate no known population parameters. A new coefficient is proposed to summarize the relative reduction in the noncentrality parameters of two nested models. Two estimators of the coefficient yield new normed (CFI) and nonnormed (FI) fit indexes. CFI avoids the underestimation of fit often noted in small samples for Bentler and Bonett's (1980) normed fit index (NFI). FI is a linear function of Bentler and Bonett's non-normed fit index (NNFI) that avoids the extreme underestimation and overestimation often found in NNFI. Asymptotically, CFI, FI, NFI, and a new index developed by Bollen are equivalent measures of comparative fit, whereas NNFI measures relative fit by comparing noncentrality per degree of freedom.

To develop a reliable and valid self-report scale which (1) will assess the distress and difficulties experienced in living with a problem of appearance; (2) can be used with clinical and non-clinical populations; and (3) facilitates clinical decisionmaking and research through good standardization, sensitivity and discrimination. Design.Cross-sectional survey designs using clinical and non-clinical populations and a pre-post intervention design using plastic surgery patients. Method. A large initial item set was refined through a controlled pre-post surgery study and a cross-sectional study of a plastic surgery waiting list (606). The resulting 59-item scale was administered to 1740 patients with problems of appearance and to a representative general population sample (1001). Results. Principal component and factor analyses identified a stable five-factor structure accounting for 63.5% of the variance, with a primary factor of self-consciousness of appearance. Internal consistency was high (alpha= .98) and test-retest reliabilities (three months) were good (.75 (general population); .86 (patients)). Correlations with existing tests showed appropriate criterion validity (.74-.62). Good construct validity was evidenced in pre- and post-operative changes, in differences between patients and controls and in convergent and divergent correlation patterns. The general population data reveal widespread concerns about appearance. Conclusions. The DAS-59 provides a widely acceptable, psychometrically robust, factorial self-report scale to assess distress and dysfunction in problems of appearance across the full range of 'visibility' and aetiologies.

Advertisements link even skin tones with youth and general health, and beauty products promise a 'healthy glow' in exchange for, sometimes considerable, financial outlay. In addition to its visual importance, the skin is our largest sensory organ which performs an important defence function against heat, cold, and external chemicals as well as helping to regulate body temperature. Synthesis of the pigment melanin, produced in the upper layer of skin (the epidermis), efficiently protects from ultraviolet (UV) rays in daylight and allows vitamin D, essential for growth and calcification of the bones, to be synthesized from sunlight. Any disruption to these functions because of trauma or disease can have a physical, social, and psychological impact on the person affected. Furthermore, skin is particularly susceptible to the effects of stress, which generates a physiological response (which may include increased sweating and blushing)... which in turn establishes a cognitive, emotional, and behavioural loop which can be distressing and difficult to interrupt. 54% of the population are affected by skin disease each year, and 15-25% of primary care consultations are due to skin disease (Schofield et al., 2009). Whilst many conditions can affect the appearance of the skin in different ways, this chapter focuses on acne, atopic eczema, vitiligo, psoriasis, and skin cancer as exemplars to highlight the psychosocial impact of an altered appearance due to disease and to consider the provision of psychosocial interventions for those affected.","Visibly different people are subject to staring and unwelcome attention, avoidance, through to overt teasing, hostility and rejection (e.g., MacGregor et al., 1953;Lansdown et al., 1997;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2012).","['The subjective experience of living with a different appearance has been well reported.', 'Visibly different people are subject to staring and unwelcome attention, avoidance, through to overt teasing, hostility and rejection (e.g., MacGregor et al., 1953;Lansdown et al., 1997;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2012).', 'The resultant psychological distress and dysfunction associated with visible differences associated with disease, traumatic injury and congenital and developmental abnormality has similarly been increasingly documented over recent years (Bessell et al., 2012b).', 'Difficulties reported include social avoidance, fear of negative evaluation, shame, and anxiety (Rosser, Moss & Rumsey, 2010).', 'Applied psychologists, including health, clinical, and counseling psychologists have been at the forefront of developing interventions to support people with psychological needs arising from visible differences (Bessell et al., 2012a;Bessell et al., 2012b), and in developing a clearer understanding of the differentiating factors and processes between those who adjust well, and those who struggle to cope and manage with differing appearances.', 'It is clear that the objective severity of appearance differences has little impact on the psychological adjustment to visible differences (Moss, 2005).', 'The underlying processes which do mediate and moderate individual differences in adjustment include the perception and use of social support, the availability of negative self views within the self-concept, and attentional biases towards appearance related information in the external environment (cf.', 'Moss & Rosser, 2012).', 'Within the literature on body image in the wider population, the tripartite influence model of adjustment highlights the social impacts of peers, family and the media on body image, including the internalization of social ideals about appearance, and engagement in social comparison processes (Thompson et al., 1999).', 'An extensive literature exists based on these predictors, the relationships between them and identifying factors which intervene between these predictors, psychosocial outcomes, and appearance related behaviours.']",0,"['The subjective experience of living with a different appearance has been well reported.', 'Visibly different people are subject to staring and unwelcome attention, avoidance, through to overt teasing, hostility and rejection (e.g., MacGregor et al., 1953;Lansdown et al., 1997;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2012).']"

Face IT was tested against a non-intervention control group and standard CBT-based face-to-face delivery. Eighty-three participants were assessed at four time points using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales, Derriford Appearance Scale-24, Body Image Quality of Life Inventory and Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE). The findings indicate a significant reduction in anxiety and appearance-related distress in both the Face IT intervention and the face-to-face condition. Similar findings were reported for depressive symptoms and FNE. Results at the three and six months follow-up demonstrate increased improvements in psychological functioning with both interventions.

Blatt""]","The SNARE protein of Arabidopsis, SYP121, contributes to vesicle traffic and also controls the gating of K+ channels for K+ uptake by binding to the KC1 channel subunit. The identity of the KC1 binding site on the SNARE protein, described in this study, points to a novel role for the channel subunit in coordinating vesicle traffic. The SNARE (for soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor protein attachment protein receptor) protein SYP121 (=SYR1/PEN1) of Arabidopsis thaliana facilitates vesicle traffic, delivering ion channels and other cargo to the plasma membrane, and contributing to plant cell expansion and defense. Recently, we reported that SYP121 also interacts directly with the K+ channel subunit KC1 and forms a tripartite complex with a second K+ channel subunit, AKT1, to control channel gating and K+ transport. Here, we report isolating a minimal sequence motif of SYP121 prerequisite for its interaction with KC1. We made use of yeast mating-based split-ubiquitin and in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays for protein-protein interaction and of expression and electrophysiological analysis. The results show that interaction of SYP121 with KC1 is associated with a novel FxRF motif uniquely situated within the first 12 residues of the SNARE sequence, that this motif is the minimal requirement for SNARE-dependent alterations in K+ channel gating when heterologously expressed, and that rescue of KC1-associated K+ current of the root epidermis in syp121 mutant Arabidopsis plants depends on expression of SNARE constructs incorporating this motif. These results establish the FxRF sequence as a previously unidentified motif required for SNARE-ion channel interactions and lead us to suggest a mechanistic framework for understanding the coordination of vesicle traffic with transmembrane ion transport.","More proteins potentially able to interact with SNAREs can have a direct influence on membrane potential such as ion channels, as shown in the case of SYP121, able to interact and control the K(+) channel KC1 (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010).","['A mechanism for the i-SNARE effect of yeast Qc-SNAREs is described by the competition between endosomal (Tlg1 and Syn8) and vacuolar form (Vam7) of the proteins (Izawa et al., 2012) and because of their ability to interact with V-ATPase subunits influencing membrane potential (Strasser et al., 2011).', 'More proteins potentially able to interact with SNAREs can have a direct influence on membrane potential such as ion channels, as shown in the case of SYP121, able to interact and control the K(+) channel KC1 (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010).']",4,"['More proteins potentially able to interact with SNAREs can have a direct influence on membrane potential such as ion channels, as shown in the case of SYP121, able to interact and control the K(+) channel KC1 (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010).']"

Their role in the vesicle sorting to the central vacuole has been revised and they were found to have a novel inhibitory function. When transiently overexpressed, the SYP51 and the SYP52 distributed between the TGN and the tonoplast.

Genetic deletion and siRNA-based knockdown have been instrumental in assigning given SNAREs to defined intracellular transport steps. However, SNARE depletion occasionally results in barely detectable phenotypes. To understand how cells cope with SNARE loss, we have knocked down several SNAREs functioning in early endosome fusion. Surprisingly, knockdown of syntaxin 13, syntaxin 6 and vti1a, alone or in combinations, did not result in measurable changes of endosomal trafficking or fusion. We found that the residual SNARE levels (typically approximately 10%) were sufficient for a substantial amount of SNARE-SNARE interactions. Conversely, in wild-type cells, most SNARE molecules were concentrated in clusters, constituting a spare pool not readily available for interactions. Additionally, the knockdown organelles exhibited enhanced docking. We conclude that SNAREs are expressed at much higher levels than needed for maintenance of organelle fusion, and that loss of SNAREs is compensated for by the co-regulation of the docking machinery.","This consideration was first formulated by Bethani and co-workers upon analysis of a rich literature showing that knockdown of some SNARE genes have little effect on endomembranes (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009, and references within).","['This consideration was first formulated by Bethani and co-workers upon analysis of a rich literature showing that knockdown of some SNARE genes have little effect on endomembranes (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009, and references within).', 'It was shown that in the cells where SNAREs were silenced using siRNA, membrane compartments exhibited an enhanced docking instead of the expected inhibition.', 'In particular the authors observed that there were proportionally more docked endosomes in the syntaxin 13 knockdown, compared with the control.', 'About the alteration of SNARE function, it is essential to remember that antibodies or recombinant SNARE fragments, showing inhibitory or dominant negative (DN) effect, for example, on syntaxin 13 (Bethani et al., 2009), induce effects that are very different: antibodies cause the depletion of active domains while SNARE fragments cause the competitive saturation of the interacting partners.', 'The reduction of gene expression by siRNA, when other homologous gene products remain expressed, has a very different effect too.']",4,"['This consideration was first formulated by Bethani and co-workers upon analysis of a rich literature showing that knockdown of some SNARE genes have little effect on endomembranes (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009, and references within).', 'It was shown that in the cells where SNAREs were silenced using siRNA, membrane compartments exhibited an enhanced docking instead of the expected inhibition.', 'In particular the authors observed that there were proportionally more docked endosomes in the syntaxin 13 knockdown, compared with the control.']"

We show that this last step is inhibited by overexpression of Arabidopsis thaliana syntaxin PEP12/SYP21, causing an accumulation of soluble and membrane cargo and the plant vacuolar sorting receptor BP80 in the PVC. Anterograde transport proceeds normally from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and the PVC, although export from the PVC appears to be compromised, affecting both anterograde membrane flow to the vacuole and the recycling route of BP80 to the Golgi. However, Golgi-mediated transport of soluble and membrane cargo toward the plasma membrane is not affected, but a soluble BP80 ligand is partially mis-sorted to the culture medium. We also observe clustering of individual PVC bodies that move together and possibly fuse with each other, forming enlarged compartments. We conclude that PEP12/SYP21 overexpression specifically inhibits export from the PVC without affecting the Golgi complex or compromising the secretory branch of the endomembrane system. The results provide a functional in vivo assay that confirms PEP12/SYP21 involvement in vacuolar sorting and indicates that excess of this syntaxin in the PVC can be detrimental for further transport from this organelle.","Tyrrell and co-workers (Tyrrell et al., 2007) found that the soluble DN variant of SYP21 in Arabidopsis thaliana blocks traffic of TIP1:1-YFP chimera to the tonoplast but, it has been also demonstrated that over-expression of SYP21 inhibited PVCto-vacuole traffic in vivo (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2006).","['The vacuolar Qa-SNAREs of SYP2 family where recently judged totally redundant in function (Shirakawa et al., 2010) but their partner-SNAREs, the Qb-SNAREs Vti11, and Vti12 (Sanmartin et al., 2007) and Qc-SNAREs SYP51 and SYP52 (De Benedictis et al., 2012) were found functionally different.', 'More contradictory work was published about SYP2s.', 'Tyrrell and co-workers (Tyrrell et al., 2007) found that the soluble DN variant of SYP21 in Arabidopsis thaliana blocks traffic of TIP1:1-YFP chimera to the tonoplast but, it has been also demonstrated that over-expression of SYP21 inhibited PVCto-vacuole traffic in vivo (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2006).']",4,"['Tyrrell and co-workers (Tyrrell et al., 2007) found that the soluble DN variant of SYP21 in Arabidopsis thaliana blocks traffic of TIP1:1-YFP chimera to the tonoplast but, it has been also demonstrated that over-expression of SYP21 inhibited PVCto-vacuole traffic in vivo (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2006).']"

By simple infiltration of Agrobacterium cells carrying appropriate plasmid constructs into Petunia hybrida leaves and petals, reproducible expression can be revealed by GFP fluorescence within one day without using expensive equipment (e.g. biolistic gun or electroporation apparatus) or complicated procedures (e.g. preparation of protoplasts). Different vacuolar markers for the neutral compartment (GFP-Chi) or the lytic one (Aleu-GFP), and an ER resident protein (GFP-KDEL) were used.

V(0) alone has an additional function, facilitating membrane fusion in the endocytic and late exocytic pathways. V(0) contains a hexameric proteolipid cylinder, which might support fusion as proposed in proteinaceous pore models. To test this, we randomly mutagenized proteolipids. We recovered alleles that preserve proton translocation, normal SNARE activation and trans-SNARE pairing but that impair lipid and content mixing. Critical residues were found in all subunits of the proteolipid ring. They concentrate within the bilayer, close to the ring subunit interfaces. The fusion-impairing proteolipid substitutions stabilize the interaction of V(0) with V(1). Deletion of the vacuolar v-SNARE Nyv1 has the same effect, suggesting that both types of mutations similarly alter the conformation of V(0). Also covalent linkage of subunits in the proteolipid cylinder blocks vacuole fusion. We propose that a SNARE-dependent conformational change in V(0) proteolipids might stimulate fusion by creating a hydrophobic crevice that promotes lipid reorientation and formation of a lipidic fusion pore.","From new data about vacuolar fusion in yeast, it seems that different SNAREs actively bind to different V-ATPase subunits, influencing their interaction with the proteolipid cylinder so promoting, or inhibiting, the lipid reorientation for the formation of a lipidic fusion pore (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).","['From new data about vacuolar fusion in yeast, it seems that different SNAREs actively bind to different V-ATPase subunits, influencing their interaction with the proteolipid cylinder so promoting, or inhibiting, the lipid reorientation for the formation of a lipidic fusion pore (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).', 'It is extremely interesting a recent report on SNAREs interaction with proteolipid (Di Giovanni et al., 2010).', 'It was suggested that this interaction had the effect to concentrate SNAREs in some areas to enhance their fusogenic potential but it is now evident that more regulatory events than simple localization is involved.', 'The possibility of a direct interaction between dissociated SNAREs and other transmembrane proteins influencing the lipid bilayer is extremely interesting and may represent a further level of specific regulation of membrane traffic.']",4,"['From new data about vacuolar fusion in yeast, it seems that different SNAREs actively bind to different V-ATPase subunits, influencing their interaction with the proteolipid cylinder so promoting, or inhibiting, the lipid reorientation for the formation of a lipidic fusion pore (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).']"

In this report we aimed to show that Arabidopsis thaliana syntaxins are involved in this process and contribute to spatially define exocytosis and membrane recycling.Using GFP-fusion constructs, we imaged the distribution of pollen-specific (AtSYP124) and non-pollen syntaxins (AtSYP121 and AtSYP122) in transiently transformed Nicotiana tabacum pollen tubes. All three proteins associate with the plasma membrane and with apical vesicles indicating a conserved action mechanism for all SYPs. However, the GFP tagged SYP124 showed a specific distribution with a higher labelling at the plasma membrane flanks, 10-25 mum behind the apex. This distribution is affected by Ca2+ fluxes as revealed by treatment with Gd3+ (an inhibitor of extracellular Ca2+ influx) and TMB-8 (an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+ release). Both inhibitors decreased growth rate but the distribution of SYP124 at the plasma membrane was more strongly affected by Gd3+. Competition with a related dominant negative mutant affected the specific distribution of SYP124 but not tip growth. In contrast, co-expression of the phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate 5-kinase 4 (PIP5K4) or of the small GTPase Rab11 perturbed polarity and the normal distribution of GFP-SYP but did not inhibit the accumulation in vesicles or at the plasma membrane.The results presented suggest that in normal growing pollen tubes, a net exocytic flow occurs in the flanks of the tube apex mediated by SYP124. The specific distribution of SYP124 at the plasma membrane is affected by changes in Ca2+ levels in agreement with the importance of this ion for exocytosis. Apical growth and the specific localization of SYP124 were affected by regulators of membrane secretion (Ca2+, PIP5K4 and Rab11) but competition with a dominant negative mutant affected only SYP distribution. These data thus suggest that syntaxins alone do not provide the level of specificity that is required for apical growth and that additional signalling and functional mechanisms are required.","Regulating t-SNARE distribution the cell could dynamically modulate vesicle fusion probabilities and consequently the kinetics of the cellular response (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010;Yang et al., 2012).","['Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain protein clustering in micro-domains and the t-SNARE distribution seems to depend both on lipidic and proteic contributions (Yang et al., 2012).', 'Regulating t-SNARE distribution the cell could dynamically modulate vesicle fusion probabilities and consequently the kinetics of the cellular response (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010;Yang et al., 2012).', 'Additional structural roles for t-SNAREs cannot be excluded.']",0,"['Regulating t-SNARE distribution the cell could dynamically modulate vesicle fusion probabilities and consequently the kinetics of the cellular response (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010;Yang et al., 2012).']"

Plasma membrane SNAREs (tSNAREs) are proposed to reside in dense clusters containing many molecules, thus providing a concentrated reservoir to promote membrane fusion. However, biophysical experiments suggest that a small number of SNAREs are sufficient to drive a single fusion event. Here we show, using molecular imaging, that the majority of tSNARE molecules are spatially separated from secretory vesicles. Furthermore, the motilities of the individual tSNAREs are constrained in membrane micro-domains, maintaining a non-random molecular distribution and limiting the maximum number of molecules encountered by secretory vesicles.

We have explored this dominant-negative approach further to examine the specificity and overlaps in Sp2 activity by generating a toolbox of truncated SNARE constructs and antibodies for transient expression and analysis. Using a quantitative ratiometric approach with secreted green fluorescent protein (secGFP), we report here that traffic to the plasma membrane is suppressed selectively by Sp2 fragments of plasma membrane SNAREs AtSYP121 and AtSYP122, but not of the closely related SNARE AtSYP111 nor of the SNARE AtSYP21 that resides at the pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC).

We now report a direct interaction between V0 c-subunit and the v-SNARE synaptobrevin, constituting a molecular link between the V-ATPase and SNARE-mediated fusion. Interaction domains were mapped to the membrane-proximal domain of VAMP2 and the cytosolic 3.4 loop of c-subunit.

The major post-Golgi compartments are numerous and appear to be similar to their counterparts in animals. However, endosomes are rather ill defined morphologically but seem to be involved in specific trafficking pathways. Many plasma-membrane proteins cycle constitutively via endosomal compartments. The trans-Golgi network (TGN) appears to be an early endosome where secretory and endocytic traffic meet. Endocytosed proteins that are to be degraded are targeted to the vacuole via the multivesiculate prevacuolar compartment (PVC) whereas cycling proteins pass through recycling endosomes. The trafficking machinery involves the same classes of proteins as in other eukaryotes. However, there are modifications that match the specifics of post-Golgi traffic in plants. Although plants lack epithelia, some plasma-membrane proteins are located on specific faces of the cell which reflects polarized traffic and influences the physiological performance of the tissue. Plants also differentiate highly polarized tip-growing cells in which post-Golgi traffic is adapted to very high rates of targeted exocytosis, endocytosis and recycling.","A plant characteristic i-SNARE activity could be determinant on vacuoles or post-Golgi endocytic compartments since these compartments appear to diversify between plants and non-plant organisms (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009).","['A plant characteristic i-SNARE activity could be determinant on vacuoles or post-Golgi endocytic compartments since these compartments appear to diversify between plants and non-plant organisms (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009).', 'In fact, the understanding of i-SNAREs function may have extreme relevance in the comprehension of vacuolar complex organization since it may regulate homotypic membrane fusion events among large vacuolar compartments.']",0,"['A plant characteristic i-SNARE activity could be determinant on vacuoles or post-Golgi endocytic compartments since these compartments appear to diversify between plants and non-plant organisms (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009).']"

The role of tomato LeRab11a in secretion was analyzed in tobacco protoplasts. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)/red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged LeRab11a was localized at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in vivo. Two serines in the GTP-binding site of the protein were mutagenized, giving rise to the three mutants Rab11S22N, Rab11S27N and Rab11S22/27N. The double mutation reduced secretion of a marker protein, secRGUS (secreted rat beta-glucuronidase), by half, whereas each of the single mutations alone had a much smaller effect, showing that both serines have to be mutated to obtain a dominant negative effect on LeRab11a function. The dominant negative mutant was used to determine whether Rab11 is involved in the pathway(s) regulated by the plasma membrane syntaxins SYP121 and SYP122. Co-expression of either of these GFP-tagged syntaxins with the dominant negative Rab11S22/27N mutant led to the appearance of endosomes, but co-expression of GFP-tagged SYP122 also labeled the endoplasmic reticulum and dotted structures. However, co-expression of Rab11S22/27N with SYP121 dominant negative mutants decreased secretion of secRGUS further compared with the expression of Rab11S22/27N alone, whereas co-expression of Rab11S22/27N with SYP122 had no synergistic effect. With the same essay, the difference between SYP121- and SYP122-dependent secretion was then evidenced. The results suggest that Rab11 regulates anterograde transport from the TGN to the plasma membrane and strongly implicate SYP122, rather than SYP121. The differential effect of LeRab11a supports the possibility that SYP121 and SYP122 drive independent secretory events.","Overexpression of DN variants to inhibit specific functions seems to offer a better tool to affect the molecular machinery leaving no options to the plant cell to adapt and mask the effect (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008;Silva et al., 2010;De Caroli et al., 2011;De Benedictis et al., 2012).","['The definition of redundancy or specificity of plant SNAREs function will probably generate further contradiction due to the experimental approach.', 'The experience matured in our studies on SNARE function specificity tells us that a recognized functional redundancy of SNARE and their abundance in the endomembrane system might prove an obstacle in using stable transformation and knockout plants for this kind of studies.', 'Overexpression of DN variants to inhibit specific functions seems to offer a better tool to affect the molecular machinery leaving no options to the plant cell to adapt and mask the effect (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008;Silva et al., 2010;De Caroli et al., 2011;De Benedictis et al., 2012).']",0,"['The definition of redundancy or specificity of plant SNAREs function will probably generate further contradiction due to the experimental approach.', 'The experience matured in our studies on SNARE function specificity tells us that a recognized functional redundancy of SNARE and their abundance in the endomembrane system might prove an obstacle in using stable transformation and knockout plants for this kind of studies.', 'Overexpression of DN variants to inhibit specific functions seems to offer a better tool to affect the molecular machinery leaving no options to the plant cell to adapt and mask the effect (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008;Silva et al., 2010;De Caroli et al., 2011;De Benedictis et al., 2012).']"

Vps33 is an SM protein and subunit of the Vps-C complexes HOPS (homotypic fusion and protein sorting) and CORVET (class C core vacuole/endosome tethering), which are central regulators of endocytic traffic. Here we present biochemical studies of interactions between Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar SNAREs and the HOPS holocomplex or Vps33 alone. HOPS binds the N-terminal H(abc) domain of the Qa-family SNARE Vam3, but Vps33 is not required for this interaction. Instead, Vps33 binds the SNARE domains of Vam3, Vam7, and Nyv1. Vps33 directly binds vacuolar quaternary SNARE complexes, and the affinity of Vps33 for SNARE complexes is greater than for individual SNAREs. Through targeted mutational analyses, we identify missense mutations of Vps33 that produce a novel set of defects, including cargo missorting and the loss of Vps33-HOPS association. Together these data suggest a working model for membrane docking: HOPS associates with N-terminal domains of Vam3 and Vam7 through Vps33-independent interactions, which are followed by binding of Vps33, the HOPS SM protein, to SNARE domains and finally to the quaternary SNARE complex.

CC1099,30319389,Uncomfortable images produce non-sparse responses in a model of primary visual cortex,P Hibbard,What Is the Goal of Sensory Coding?,"[""David J. Field""]","A number of recent attempts have been made to describe early sensory coding in terms of a general information processing strategy. In this paper, two strategies are contrasted. Both strategies take advantage of the redundancy in the environment to produce more effective representations. The first is described as a ÒcompactÓ coding scheme. A compact code performs a transform that allows the input to be represented with a reduced number of vectors (cells) with minimal RMS error. This approach has recently become popular in the neural network literature and is related to a process called Principal Components Analysis (PCA). A number of recent papers have suggested that the optimal ÒcompactÓ code for representing natural scenes will have units with receptive field profiles much like those found in the retina and primary visual cortex. However, in this paper, it is proposed that compact coding schemes are insufficient to account for the receptive field properties of cells in the mammalian visual pathway. In contrast, it is proposed that the visual system is near to optimal in representing natural scenes only if optimality is defined in terms of Òsparse distributedÓ coding. In a sparse distributed code, all cells in the code have an equal response probability across the class of images but have a low response probability for any single image. In such a code, the dimensionality is not reduced. Rather, the redundancy of the input is transformed into the redundancy of the firing pattern of cells. It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis). In measurements with 55 calibrated natural scenes, the kurtosis was found to peak when the bandwidths of the visual code matched those of cells in the mammalian visual cortex. Codes resembling Òwavelet transformsÓ are proposed to be effective because the response histograms of such codes are sparse (i.e., show high kurtosis) when presented with natural scenes. It is proposed that the structure of the image that allows sparse coding is found in the phase spectrum of the image. It is suggested that natural scenes, to a first approximation, can be considered as a sum of self-similar local functions (the inverse of a wavelet). Possible reasons for why sensory systems would evolve toward sparse coding are presented.",models of populations of neurons with properties similar to those found in the visual cortex have been shown to produce sparse responses to natural image inputs #AUTHOR_TAG.,"['models of populations of neurons with properties similar to those found in the visual cortex have been shown to produce sparse responses to natural image inputs #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Equally, learning algorithms that seek to generate sparse responses to natural image samples produce units with receptive fields that are strikingly similar to those found in the visual cortex [5].', 'This suggests that sparse coding might, indeed, be a strategy used by the human visual system to maximize information transfer with minimum metabolic cost.', 'It is important to note, however, that an encoding that produces sparse responses to natural images may respond non-sparsely to other inputs.']",4,"['models of populations of neurons with properties similar to those found in the visual cortex have been shown to produce sparse responses to natural image inputs #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Equally, learning algorithms that seek to generate sparse responses to natural image samples produce units with receptive fields that are strikingly similar to those found in the visual cortex [5].', 'This suggests that sparse coding might, indeed, be a strategy used by the human visual system to maximize information transfer with minimum metabolic cost.', 'It is important to note, however, that an encoding that produces sparse responses to natural images may respond non-sparsely to other inputs.']"

In this paper, we focus on lithium, beryllium, and boron (LiBeB) and on carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (CNO). LiBeB are rare elements, with negligible abundances with respect to hydrogen; on the contrary, CNO are among the most abundant elements in the Universe, after H and He. Pioneering observations of light-element surface abundances in stars started almost 70 years ago and huge progress has been achieved since then. Indeed, for different reasons, precise measurements of LiBeB and CNO are difficult, even in our Sun; however, the advent of state-of-the-art ground- and space-based instrumentation has allowed the determination of high-quality abundances in stars of different type, belonging to different Galactic populations, from metal-poor halo stars to young stars in the solar vicinity and from massive stars to cool dwarfs and giants. Noticeably, the recent large spectroscopic surveys performed with multifiber spectrographs have yielded detailed and homogeneous information on the abundances of Li and CNO for statistically significant samples of stars; this has allowed us to obtain new results and insights and, at the same time, raise new questions and challenges. A complete understanding of the light-element patterns and evolution in the Universe has not been still achieved. Perspectives for further progress will open up soon thanks to the new generation instrumentation that is under development and will come online in the coming years.","Meanwhile, #AUTHOR_TAG (2010) argued that Be abundances are generally uniform (i.e., with almost no sign of depletion) in Gtype dwarfs with T eff .","['Meanwhile, #AUTHOR_TAG (2010) argued that Be abundances are generally uniform (i.e., with almost no sign of depletion) in Gtype dwarfs with T eff .', '6000 K, regardless of the large spread of Li abundances (in contrast to F-type stars with T eff & 6000 K showing appreciable Be deficiencies in accordance with Li), which means that Li and Be do not have any correlation in Sun-like stars.']",0,"['Meanwhile, #AUTHOR_TAG (2010) argued that Be abundances are generally uniform (i.e., with almost no sign of depletion) in Gtype dwarfs with T eff .', '6000 K, regardless of the large spread of Li abundances (in contrast to F-type stars with T eff & 6000 K showing appreciable Be deficiencies in accordance with Li), which means that Li and Be do not have any correlation in Sun-like stars.']"

By combining brain imaging with polysomnography and exploiting the state of ""lucid dreaming,"" we show here that a predefined motor task performed during dreaming elicits neuronal activation in the sensorimotor cortex. In lucid dreams, the subject is aware of the dreaming state and capable of performing predefined actions while all standard polysomnographic criteria of REM sleep are fulfilled [5, 6]. Using eye signals as temporal markers, neural activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was related to dreamed hand movements during lucid REM sleep.

To examine this possibility, we conducted multiple awakenings with a trained participant during short bursts of theta activity defining the 5 th sub stage of NREM stage 1 sleep (NREM1F). Awakenings provided frequent reports of vivid dreaming containing coherent scenes--as opposed to isolated objects often associated with general sleep onset imagery. Analyses of the temporal and semantic aspects of the memories associated with this imagery suggest that multiple memories are selected for incorporation in NREM1F imagery on the basis of their semantic proximity and temporal remoteness. Analyses also demonstrate a remarkable pattern in about a third of dreams in which distinct, semantically related memories dating from as little as 10 minutes to as much as 15 years ago were bound in close temporal and spatial proximity within the novel contexts of the imagery. This offline manipulation of semantic information, observed here at a phenomenological level, bears a resemblance to processes thought to underlie integrative encoding , i.e., the encoding of an association between events that were not experienced together but which are subsequently combined because they contain at least one overlapping element.  This preliminary study provides evidence consistent with the notion that hippocampal-mediated memory processing occurs during the theta bursts found at sleep onset.","This has revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in the nature of dream experiences reported after awakenings from REM sleep, NREM sleep (McNamara et al., 2010), and NREM Stage 1 sleep onset (Nielsen et al., 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012): REM sleep has been found to possess the most vivid and immersive dreams, NREM sleep the most thought-like mentation, and Stage1 NREM sleep the briefest but nonetheless REM-like mentation (Dement and Kleitman, 1957).","['Laboratory-based dream research has been based, from its early beginnings (e.g., Dement and Kleitman, 1957), on an approach that combines physiological measurement (EEG and other markers) with subjective dream reports.', 'This has revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in the nature of dream experiences reported after awakenings from REM sleep, NREM sleep (McNamara et al., 2010), and NREM Stage 1 sleep onset (Nielsen et al., 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012): REM sleep has been found to possess the most vivid and immersive dreams, NREM sleep the most thought-like mentation, and Stage1 NREM sleep the briefest but nonetheless REM-like mentation (Dement and Kleitman, 1957).', 'One major limitation of the laboratory-based study, however, is the ""first-night effect,"" known to change sleep architectureespecially that of REM sleep- (Agnew et al., 1966) and increase the incorporation of laboratory-related content into dreams (Schredl, 2008).']",0,"['This has revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in the nature of dream experiences reported after awakenings from REM sleep, NREM sleep (McNamara et al., 2010), and NREM Stage 1 sleep onset (Nielsen et al., 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012): REM sleep has been found to possess the most vivid and immersive dreams, NREM sleep the most thought-like mentation, and Stage1 NREM sleep the briefest but nonetheless REM-like mentation (Dement and Kleitman, 1957).']"

One problem is that the spontaneous onset of self-generated mental activity makes it hard to distinguish the events that control the occurrence of the experience from those processes that ensure the continuity of an internal train of thought once initiated. This review demonstrates that a distinction between process and occurrence (a) provides theoretical clarity that has been absent from current discussions of self-generated mental activity, (b) affords conceptual leverage on seemingly disparate results associating the state with both domain-general processes and task error, and (c) draws attention to important questions for understanding unconstrained thought in contexts such as psychopathology and education.

Nathan Spreng"", ""W. Dale Stevens"", ""Jon P. Chamberlain"", ""Adrian W. Gilmore"", ""Daniel L. Schacter""]","Tasks that demand externalized attention reliably suppress default network activity while activating the dorsal attention network. These networks have an intrinsic competitive relationship; activation of one suppresses activity of the other. Consequently, many assume that default network activity is suppressed during goal-directed cognition. We challenge this assumption in an fMRI study of planning. Recent studies link default network activity with internally focused cognition, such as imagining personal future events, suggesting a role in autobiographical planning. However, it is unclear how goal-directed cognition with an internal focus is mediated by these opposing networks. A third anatomically interposed 'frontoparietal control network' might mediate planning across domains, flexibly coupling with either the default or dorsal attention network in support of internally versus externally focused goal-directed cognition, respectively. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing brain activity during autobiographical versus visuospatial planning. Autobiographical planning engaged the default network, whereas visuospatial planning engaged the dorsal attention network, consistent with the anti-correlated domains of internalized and externalized cognition. Critically, both planning tasks engaged the frontoparietal control network. Task-related activation of these three networks was anatomically consistent with independently defined resting-state functional connectivity MRI maps. Task-related functional connectivity analyses demonstrate that the default network can be involved in goal-directed cognition when its activity is coupled with the frontoparietal control network. Additionally, the frontoparietal control network may flexibly couple with the default and dorsal attention networks according to task domain, serving as a cortical mediator linking the two networks in support of goal-directed cognitive processes.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We tested the hypothesis that TID results from a reallocation of processing resources by parametrically manipulating task difficulty within three factors: target discriminability, stimulus presentation rate, and short-term memory load. Subjects performed an auditory target detection task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), responding to a single target tone or, in the short-term memory load conditions, to target sequences. Seven task conditions (a common version and two additional levels for each of the three factors) were each alternated with ""rest"" in a block design. Analysis of covariance identified brain regions in which TID occurred. Analyses of variance identified seven regions (left anterior cingulate/superior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, right anterior cingulate gyrus, left and right posterior cingulate gyrus, left posterior parieto-occipital cortex, and right precuneus) in which TID magnitude varied across task levels within a factor. Follow-up tests indicated that for each of the three factors, TID magnitude increased with task difficulty. These results suggest that TID represents reallocation of processing resources from areas in which TID occurs to areas involved in task performance. Short-term memory load and stimulus rate also predict suppression of spontaneous thought, and many of the brain areas showing TID have been linked with semantic processing, supporting claims that TID may be due in part to suspension of spontaneous semantic processes that occur during ""rest"" (Binder et al., 1999).

Research on perceptual decoupling demonstrates that mental events that arise without any external precedent (known as stimulus independent thoughts) often interfere with the online processing of sensory information. Findings regarding meta-awareness reveal that the mind is only intermittently aware of engaging in mind wandering. These basic aspects of mind wandering are considered with respect to the activity of the default network, the role of executive processes, the contributions of meta-awareness and the functionality of mind wandering.","One reason that people mind-wander much more than they are aware of doing may be that mind-wandering and the metaawareness of doing so engage some of the same brain structures, such as the anterior prefrontal cortex, so that when occupied by mind-wandering these structures cannot also create awareness of the mind-wandering (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).","['One reason that people mind-wander much more than they are aware of doing may be that mind-wandering and the metaawareness of doing so engage some of the same brain structures, such as the anterior prefrontal cortex, so that when occupied by mind-wandering these structures cannot also create awareness of the mind-wandering (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).', 'Thus, energy goes into mind-wandering without the mind-wanderer being aware that it is going on.']",0,"['One reason that people mind-wander much more than they are aware of doing may be that mind-wandering and the metaawareness of doing so engage some of the same brain structures, such as the anterior prefrontal cortex, so that when occupied by mind-wandering these structures cannot also create awareness of the mind-wandering (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).']"

Although such decisions are often implicit, they help determine academic performance, career trajectories, and even health outcomes. Previous research has shed light both on the executive control functions that ultimately define cognitive labor and on a ""default mode"" of brain function that accompanies cognitive leisure. However, little is known about how labor/leisure decisions are actually made. Here, we identify a central principle guiding such decisions. Results from 3 economic-choice experiments indicate that the motivation underlying cognitive labor/leisure decision making is to strike an optimal balance between income and leisure, as given by a joint utility function. The results reported establish a new connection between microeconomics and research on executive function. They also suggest a new interpretation of so-called ego-depletion effects and a potential new approach to such phenomena as mind wandering and self-control failure.","With regard to the effect on mind-wandering of what people have at stake, #AUTHOR_TAG and Botvinick (2012) examined the amount of time participants spent on a demanding or an undemanding task in sessions in which they could freely shift from one to the other.","['With regard to the effect on mind-wandering of what people have at stake, #AUTHOR_TAG and Botvinick (2012) examined the amount of time participants spent on a demanding or an undemanding task in sessions in which they could freely shift from one to the other.', 'Demanding-task trials, which, based on previous evidence, presumably reduced the opportunity for mind-wandering, were rewarded with candy pieces, whereas trials with undemanding tasks were not rewarded at all.', 'Participants were allowed to switch back and forth between the two types of task within sessions.', 'In a second session 1-2 weeks later, some participants were told that their candy ""wages"" had increased and others were told that they had decreased.', 'The time they spent with demanding tasks decreased after a wage decrease and increased after a wage increase.', 'The fact that these participants chose some unrewarded trials is consistent with having a need for freer mental activity, as in mind-wandering, and the shift toward more unrewarded trials when the wages for rewarded, demanding trials decreased indicates that mind-wandering decreases when there is more at stake in the assigned task.']",0,"['With regard to the effect on mind-wandering of what people have at stake, #AUTHOR_TAG and Botvinick (2012) examined the amount of time participants spent on a demanding or an undemanding task in sessions in which they could freely shift from one to the other.', 'Demanding-task trials, which, based on previous evidence, presumably reduced the opportunity for mind-wandering, were rewarded with candy pieces, whereas trials with undemanding tasks were not rewarded at all.', 'Participants were allowed to switch back and forth between the two types of task within sessions.', 'In a second session 1-2 weeks later, some participants were told that their candy ""wages"" had increased and others were told that they had decreased.', 'The time they spent with demanding tasks decreased after a wage decrease and increased after a wage increase.']"

Andrews-Hanna"", ""Jay S. Reidler"", ""Christine Huang"", ""Randy L. Buckner""]","A set of brain regions known as the default network increases its activity when focus on the external world is relaxed. During such moments, participants change their focus of external attention and engage in spontaneous cognitive processes including remembering the past and imagining the future. However, the functional contributions of the default network to shifts in external attention versus internal mentation have been difficult to disentangle because the two processes are correlated under typical circumstances. To address this issue, the present study manipulated factors that promote spontaneous cognition separately from those that change the scope of external attention. Results revealed that the default network increased its activity when spontaneous cognition was maximized but not when participants increased their attention to unpredictable foveal or peripheral stimuli. To examine the nature of participants' spontaneous thoughts, a second experiment used self-report questionnaires to quantify spontaneous thoughts during extended fixation epochs. Thoughts about one's personal past and future comprised a major focus of spontaneous cognition with considerable variability. Activity correlations between the medial temporal lobe and distributed cortical regions within the default network predicted a small, but significant, portion of the observed variability. Collectively, these results suggest that during passive states, activity within the default network reflects spontaneous, internally directed cognitive processes.","However, even during such operant task activity, mental content commonly shifts intermittently to other, respondent content (Klinger, 1971;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010a), which has often been dubbed daydreaming or mind-wandering.","['While people are working on specific tasks, much of their mental content will, of course, relate to the momentary task.', 'However, even during such operant task activity, mental content commonly shifts intermittently to other, respondent content (Klinger, 1971;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010a), which has often been dubbed daydreaming or mind-wandering.']",0,"['While people are working on specific tasks, much of their mental content will, of course, relate to the momentary task.', 'However, even during such operant task activity, mental content commonly shifts intermittently to other, respondent content (Klinger, 1971;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010a), which has often been dubbed daydreaming or mind-wandering.']"

The cognitive processes that the DMN possibly underlies remain a matter of debate. It has alternately been proposed that DMN activity reflects unfocused attention toward external stimuli or the occurrence of internally generated thoughts. The present study aimed at clarifying this issue by investigating the neural correlates of the various kinds of conscious experiences that can occur during task performance. Four classes of conscious experiences (i.e., being fully focused on the task, distractions by irrelevant sensations/perceptions, interfering thoughts related to the appraisal of the task, and mind-wandering) that varied along two dimensions (""task-relatedness"" and ""stimulus-dependency"") were sampled using thought-probes while the participants performed a go/no-go task. Analyses performed on the intervals preceding each probe according to the reported subjective experience revealed that both dimensions are relevant to explain activity in several regions of the DMN, namely the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and posterior inferior parietal lobe. Notably, an additive effect of the two dimensions was demonstrated for midline DMN regions. On the other hand, lateral temporal regions (also part of the DMN) were specifically related to stimulus-independent reports. These results suggest that midline DMN regions underlie cognitive processes that are active during both internal thoughts and external unfocused attention. They also strengthen the view that the DMN can be fractionated into different subcomponents and reveal the necessity to consider both the stimulus-dependent and the task-related dimensions of conscious experiences when studying the possible functional roles of the DMN.","Indeed, it appears that the brain's default-mode network provides the substrate for mind-wandering (e.g., Mason et al., 2007;Christoff et al., 2009;Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010a;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011b), a network of several ""hubs"" and ""subsystems"" (Andrews-Hanna, 2012) that probably constitutes a majority of the brain's energy consumption (Raichle, 2009).","['What follows is shaped by two evolutionary considerations.', ""First, any kind of activity that absorbs up to a half of conscious brain activity must have been selected for its contribution to the human species' survival."", 'Indeed, it appears that the brain\'s default-mode network provides the substrate for mind-wandering (e.g., Mason et al., 2007;Christoff et al., 2009;Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010a;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011b), a network of several ""hubs"" and ""subsystems"" (Andrews-Hanna, 2012) that probably constitutes a majority of the brain\'s energy consumption (Raichle, 2009).', 'It must serve important functions.', 'These include a variety of mental processes, including retrieval of past experiences and imagining future scenarios (Buckner et al., 2008), which are essential for planning and are also stock components of mind-wandering sequences.', ""Raichle (2009) argues that the default-mode network is not coextensive with conscious mind-wandering, citing the continuation of the network's activity into lighter states of anesthesia and Stages 1 and 2 of sleep (Horovitz et al., 2008), when dreaming is most frequent, and the demonstration (Christoff et al., 2009) of executive-network elements during resting states."", 'However, if one accepts that there is continuity between mind-wandering states and dreaming, and if one recognizes that non-conscious processes (meaning-complexes; Klinger, 1971Klinger, , 2011 underlie both the thought and dream segments, there is no reason to doubt the close relationship of mind-wandering and its variants with the default-mode network.']",0,"['Indeed, it appears that the brain\'s default-mode network provides the substrate for mind-wandering (e.g., Mason et al., 2007;Christoff et al., 2009;Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010a;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011b), a network of several ""hubs"" and ""subsystems"" (Andrews-Hanna, 2012) that probably constitutes a majority of the brain\'s energy consumption (Raichle, 2009).']"

This mindless reading, similar to states such as daydreaming or absentminded lapses, is a state of decoupled processing in which attention to ongoing perceptual information is reduced often in favor of the active consideration of internally generated thoughts and feelings. Normal reading involves a complex interaction between bottom-up representations of the text that is being read and top-down representations of the more general context that help to keep the readers mind on what they are doing. Since states of decoupling involve a reduced processing of sensory information, the coupling between the reader and the text breaks down during mindless reading. This reduced external coupling is one reason why mind-wandering during reading has significant implications for reading comprehension. Following the presentation of a model of the decoupled state and a specific consideration of mind-wandering during reading, five key unresolved issues for future research in mindless reading are identified.","Mind-wandering has a well-established inverse relationship to a variety of performance measures (e.g., Smallwood et al., 2004;McVay and Kane, 2012a,b;, including reading comprehension (Smallwood et al., 2003(Smallwood et al., , 2007(Smallwood et al., , 2008Smallwood and Schooler, 2006;McVay and Kane, 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2011;Mrazek et al., 2012).","['Mind-wandering has a well-established inverse relationship to a variety of performance measures (e.g., Smallwood et al., 2004;McVay and Kane, 2012a,b;, including reading comprehension (Smallwood et al., 2003(Smallwood et al., , 2007(Smallwood et al., , 2008Smallwood and Schooler, 2006;McVay and Kane, 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2011;Mrazek et al., 2012).', 'Unsworth and McMillan (2013) thoughtsampled TUTs and obtained laboratory measures of working memory capacity and a number of self-report measures: motivation for the task, interest in the topic, and previous experience with the subject matter.', 'They found that, of these, motivation for the reading task was the strongest predictor (__�0.61) of the TUT measure of mind-wandering, and mind-wandering was the strongest predictor (__�0.58) of reading comprehension.', 'In combination with the findings of Kool and Botvinick (2012) and the original findings of Antrobus et al.

Hoelscher"", ""Eric Klinger"", ""Steven G. Barta""]","The hypothesis that cues related to subjects' current concerns can control attentional and cognitive processes during sleeping and dreaming was examined by presenting concern- and nonconcern-related verbal stimuli to seven male subjects during sleep Stages 2 and REM. The taped dream reports were judged for stimulus incorporation by two independent raters. The results revealed that concern stimuli were incorporated significantly more often than nonconcern stimuli in Stage REM, although low dream recall rates prevented assessment of whether this relationship also existed in Stage 2. This rinding supports the results of a number of other studies which indicate that responsiveness to auditory stimuli during sleeping and dreaming is largely dependent on the personal significance of the stimulus to the sleeper. It further suggests that sleeping subjects are capable of making more complex and subtle cognitive discriminations, based on the waking value of the stimulus to the subject, than has previously been demonstrated. Research on the determinants of waking thought content (Klinger, 1978) has demonstrated the influence of current concerns on cognitive processes. The concept of current concern refers to the state of an organism between the time it becomes committed to a particular goal and the consummation or abandonment of the goal. During dichotic listening, cues related to subjects' current concerns exerted a controlling effect on attention, recall, and thought content. The present investigation seeks to extend these findings to effects of concernrelated cues on dream content. Responsiveness to external stimulation has been shown to occur in sleeping subjects. Subjects can be induced to perform physical acts in response to cues introduced while they are asleep (Evans, Gustafson, O'Connell, Orne, & Shor, 1970; Oswald, Taylor, & Treisman, 1960; Williams, Morlock, & Morlock, 1966).

Compared with engaging in a demanding task, rest, or no break, engaging in an undemanding task during an incubation period led to substantial improvements in performance on previously encountered problems. Critically, the context that improved performance after the incubation period was associated with higher levels of mind wandering but not with a greater number of explicitly directed thoughts about the UUT.

Accordingly, this chapter first discusses basic motivational concepts that address the processes involved in choosing and pursuing goals, and places goal pursuit within the framework of the theory of current concerns. It examines how people choose goals and traces the effects of having a goal and of the way the goal pursuit ends, in goal attainment or relinquishment. It integrates applicable neuroscientific findings that shed light on these processes. Goal choice depends on the value and costs assigned by the chooser to each alternative (incentive) and its perceived attainability, subject to such complicating factors as forecasting biases and time frame. Commitment to a goal pursuit launches a latent, time-binding brain process (a current concern) that sensitizes the individual to respond emotionally and to notice, recall, think about, dream about, and act on cues associated with the goal pursuit. These processes affect one another and are subject to implicit (nonconscious) as well as explicit influences. Goal pursuits vary according to whether the goal is an approach or avoidance goal, the time frame for action, the anticipation of the details and difficulties of the goal pursuit, and the degree of conflict with other goals. Emotional responses determine incentive values, serve as evaluative feedback during goal pursuits, and accompany consummation of or disengagement from the goal. The process of disengagement normally entails a sequence of emotional changes: invigoration, anger, depression, and recovery. Each of these components of goal choice and pursuit can go awry, leading to a variety of difficulties that become reflected in anxiety, depression, alienation, interpersonal and occupational problems, substance abuse, suicide, and other forms of psychological disturbance. Motivational structure (an individual's pattern of goal striving) is an important determinant of well-being, the sense that one's life is meaningful, and self-regulation. The chapter briefly considers the implications of the findings for counseling interventions for motivational problems that deter clients from choosing and pursuing the goals that can potentially bring them happiness and fulfillment, considerations that are discussed at length in the book's remaining chapters.","This theory, together with recent neuroscientific findings that support it, is briefly reviewed elsewhere (#AUTHOR_TAG and Cox, 2011).","['When the individual is in a situation conducive to making progress toward attaining a goal, the response to goal cues takes the form of actions or operant mental acts that advance the goal pursuit.', 'This idea is intuitively obvious, but its elaborations become complicated.', 'Whether a person views a situation as conducive to pursuing a particular goal depends on a decision process that takes into account the anticipated relative gains and losses arising from a particular course of action in comparison with alternative courses of action possible in that situation.', 'An elaborate research area has grown up around this decision process, which one can generally subsume under Expectancy X Value theory in psychology and Expected Utility theory in economics.', 'This theory, together with recent neuroscientific findings that support it, is briefly reviewed elsewhere (#AUTHOR_TAG and Cox, 2011).']",0,"['When the individual is in a situation conducive to making progress toward attaining a goal, the response to goal cues takes the form of actions or operant mental acts that advance the goal pursuit.', 'This idea is intuitively obvious, but its elaborations become complicated.', 'Whether a person views a situation as conducive to pursuing a particular goal depends on a decision process that takes into account the anticipated relative gains and losses arising from a particular course of action in comparison with alternative courses of action possible in that situation.', 'An elaborate research area has grown up around this decision process, which one can generally subsume under Expectancy X Value theory in psychology and Expected Utility theory in economics.', 'This theory, together with recent neuroscientific findings that support it, is briefly reviewed elsewhere (#AUTHOR_TAG and Cox, 2011).']"

Experiments 1 and 2 contrasted the mutual inhibition between encoding words and non-words on: (i) the frequency that thoughts and images unrelated to the task (task unrelated thought, TUT) were experienced (Experiment 1) and (ii) on the intensity of images generated from long-term memory and maintained under dual task conditions, which whilst familiar were not of particular personal salience (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 examined the physiological arousal associated with the experience of TUT in a semantic encoding task. Evidence suggested that, in general, internally generated images and thoughts, irrespective of the personal salience, were suppressed by the co-ordination of information in working memory.

Domhoff is not simply offering a new edition of a classic content analytic system; he goes far beyond that objective. First of all, he introduces new possibilities for the analysis of the original dream codes. This book is written in a clear style, and it is didactically well composed.

The current paper proposes that such thought is produced through cooperation between autobiographical information provided by the default mode network and a frontal-parietal control network which helps sustain and buffer internal trains of thought against disruption by the external world. This hypothesis explains at least two features of the literature on internally guided thought. First, access to the top-down control system is a generally accepted prerequisite of conscious experience; this explains why activation of this system and default mode activity is often observed together during periods of internally guided thought. Second, because the top-down attentional control system has a limited capacity, internally and externally driven streams can come into conflict, with the result that perceptual information must be denied attentional amplification if the internal stream is to be maintained. This explains why internal thought is routinely associated with a state of perceptual decoupling, reflected in both measured anticorrelations between the default mode network and sensory areas and the manner in which task unrelated thoughts compromise task performance. This paper offers a hypothesis that should help to constrain and guide interpretations, investigations, and analyses of the neural processes involved in internally driven cognition.

Both of these individual-differences studies assessed large samples of university subjects' WMC abilities via multiple tasks and probed their immediate thought content while reading; in reporting any task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs), subjects indicated whether those thoughts were about the future or the past, if applicable. In contrast to previously published findings indicating that higher WMC subjects mind-wandered about the future more than did lower WMC subjects (B. Baird, J. Smallwood, & J. W. Schooler, 2011, Back to the future: Autobiographical planning and the functionality of mind-wandering, Consciousness and Cognition, Vol. 20, pp. 1604-1611), we found only weak to modest negative correlations between WMC and future-oriented TUTs.

Methodology: The study applied a mixed methodology. First, the authors conducted two qualitative studies (focus groups) to establish the relationships between flow, flow consciousness, and regret. Second, the authors conducted a quantitative study using data collected through an online questionnaire. Participants were asked to recall a recent shopping experience. To conduct confirmatory factor analysis, the authors gathered data from 304 consumers who had searched for, and purchased, a product on Amazon (www.amazon.com). Structural equation modelling, based on covariance, was used to test the hypotheses. Findings: Flow consciousness is found to reduce consumer regret after an impulse purchase. Originality: This is the first study to examine the effects of flow consciousness on consumer behaviour after an impulse purchase. In particular, research has not analysed the effects that flow consciousness has on negative feelings experienced after the impulse purchase of a product.

Spatially separated patches of neuronal assemblies have been found to show synchronized oscillatory activity behavior and are said to be functionally connected. One of the most robust of these is the default mode network, which is associated with intrinsic processes like mind wandering and self-projection. Furthermore, activity in this network is anticorrelated with activity in a network that is linked to attention to external stimuli. The integrity of both networks is disturbed in altered states of consciousness, like sleep, general anesthesia and hypnosis. In coma and related disorders of consciousness, encompassing the vegetative state (unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) and minimally conscious state, default mode network integrity correlates with the level of remaining consciousness, offering the possibility of using this information for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.

This phenomenon produces tension within the cognitive sciences because the interfering nature of these thoughts is at odds with the assumption that such processes are functional in daily life. In their comment, McVay and Kane (2010) suggested that failures in executive control can create the conditions that favor mind wanderingÑa control-failure hypothesis that questions whether mind wandering consumes resources. Whether mind wandering always occurs following a control failure, it is always a conscious reportable experience and so is globally available to the system. Such global availability suggests that mind wandering does indeed demand resources, in particular access to a global workspace that supports conscious experience. Although the control-failure view explains the transient occurrence of mind wandering during demanding tasks, the global availability hypothesis is consistent with all mind wandering, regardless of context; it is implied by many features of the argument proposed by McVay and Kane (2010).

The semantic processing of language and action has been linked to the N400 component of the event-related potential (ERP). The authors developed an ERP paradigm in which infants and adults observed simple sequences of actions. In one condition the conclusion of the sequence was anticipated, whereas in the other condition the conclusion was not anticipated. Adults and infants at 9 months and 7 months were assessed via the same neural mechanisms-the N400 component and analysis of the theta frequency. Results indicated that adults and infants at 9 months produced N400-like responses when anticipating action conclusions. The infants at 7 months displayed no N400 component. Analysis of the theta frequency provided support for the relation between the N400 and semantic processing.

This study investigates the extent to which this effect of emotion on recall varies as a function of cognitively controllable inference processes and examines the relation of the effects of emotion to those of imaginability and concern-relatedness. Forty different words were presented visually under one of six orienting conditions that varied according to what the subject was asked to rate: their length, pronounceability, concreteness, defineability, the strength of emotion elicited by the word, and the relation of the word to personal concerns. Subjects were then asked to write as many words as they could recall. Words that aroused stronger emotion and were easier to represent in imagery were recalled better than emotionally less arousing and imaginally less evocative words, regardless of the nature of the orienting task. The evidence suggests that the emotional properties of words are evaluated automatically in an early processing stage, without requiring subjects to reflect on word content.

The present study employed a novel fMRI paradigm designed to distinguish between these two components at the neural level. Participants designed book cover illustrations while alternating between the generation and evaluation of ideas. The use of an fMRI-compatible drawing tablet allowed for a more natural drawing and creative environment. Creative generation was associated with preferential recruitment of medial temporal lobe regions, while creative evaluation was associated with joint recruitment of executive and default network regions and activation of the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, and temporopolar cortex. Executive and default regions showed positive functional connectivity throughout task performance. These findings suggest that the medial temporal lobe may be central to the generation of novel ideas and creative evaluation may extend beyond deliberate analytical processes supported by executive brain regions to include more spontaneous affective and visceroceptive evaluative processes supported by default and limbic regions.

Alcohol abusers (n=14) were tested on admission to inpatient treatment and immediately before discharge, 4 weeks later; non-abusers (n=16) were also tested twice, with a 4-week intervening interval. Alcohol abusers were assessed for alcohol use 3 months after discharge. Unlike control participants and alcohol abusers whose treatment was successful, alcohol abusers whose treatment was unsuccessful (who relapsed or did not maintain post-discharge outpatient contact) had a significant increase in attentional distraction for alcohol stimuli during the 4 weeks of inpatient treatment. Compared to control participants and alcohol abusers who completed the 4 weeks of treatment, those who did not complete treatment (n=9) were highly distracted by concern-related stimuli at treatment admission. The results have implications for understanding the cognitive and motivational processes underlying successful treatment for alcohol abuse.","Frequent drinkers were slower to name the colors of alcohol-related words, and the amount of interference, which is calculated as RT to alcohol words minus RT to neutral words, is correlated with the amount of alcohol the participant normally consumed in a week #AUTHOR_TAG, 2008, 2009; This effect was largely independent of participants' overall executive cognitive functioning).","['W.

Cox""]","Localized, task-induced decreases in cerebral blood flow are a frequent finding in functional brain imaging research but remain poorly understood. One account of these phenomena postulates processes ongoing during conscious, resting states that are interrupted or inhibited by task performance. Psychological evidence suggests that conscious humans are engaged almost continuously in adaptive processes involving semantic knowledge retrieval, representation in awareness, and directed manipulation of represented knowledge for organization, problem-solving, and planning. If interruption of such 'conceptual' processes accounts for task-induced deactivation, tasks that also engage these conceptual processes should not cause deactivation. Furthermore, comparisons between conceptual and nonconceptual tasks should show activation during conceptual tasks of the same brain areas that are 'deactivated' relative to rest. To test this model, functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired during a resting state, a perceptual task, and a semantic retrieval task. A network of left-hemisphere polymodal cortical regions showed higher signal values during the resting state than during the perceptual task but equal values during the resting and semantic conditions. This result is consistent with the proposal that perceptual tasks interrupt processes ongoing during rest that involve many of the same brain areas engaged during semantic retrieval. As further evidence for this model, the same network of brain areas was activated in two direct comparisons between semantic and perceptual processing tasks. This same 'conceptual processing' network was also identified in several previous studies that contrasted semantic and perceptual tasks or resting and active states. The model proposed here offers a unified account of these findings and may help to explain several unanticipated results from prior studies of semantic processing.","See above the work by Christoff et al.

In two studies, we examined two possible sources of this variation: personality and culture. Method: In Study 1, participants (Belgian university students) recalled a recent event that was characterized by high or low valence or arousal and reported on their feelings and their personality in terms of the Five-Factor Model. In Study 2, participants from Canada, China/Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, and Spain reported on their feelings in a thin slice of time and on their personality. Results: In Study 1, we replicated the V-shape as characterizing the relation between valence and arousal, and identified personality correlates of experiencing particular valence-arousal combinations. In Study 2, we documented how the V-shaped relation varied as a function of Western versus Eastern cultural background and personality. Conclusions: The results showed that the steepness of the V-shaped relation between valence and arousal increases with Extraversion within cultures, and with a West-East distinction between cultures.

Most thought samples contained some interior monologue, largely independent of other variables. Thought properties were uncorrelated with affective variables, frustration of goals, and impulses to drink alcohol. Factors for individual differences differed sharply from the intrasubject results, with a single undifferentiated Vividness factor and controllability no longer a separate factor.

In laboratory and daily-life assessments, people with lower WMC mind wander more frequently than do those with higher WMC, at least during demanding tasks.

Lack or loss of meaning therefore inherently signals psychological deprivation or disorder. Moreover, the research area that has grown around the phenomenon of search for meaning, while developing important contributions in a number of areas, parallels other research activities that proceed under different names but that similarly probe facets of basic human nature. To an important degree, the language of research on the search for meaning can be mapped onto concept systems of other research traditions. This chapter will proceed by first examining what is meant by the search for meaning and then arguing that in the sense in which it is used here, the search for meaning is an inevitable outgrowth of human evolution. The chapter then examines some important implications of this view with respect to both basic human functions and certain human disorders.","There is extensive reason to believe that a sense that one's life is meaningful depends on having attractive, attainable goals and that this is necessary for sustained mental health (Klinger, 1977(#AUTHOR_TAG , 2012.","['This raises the question: to what extent are people positively motivated to spend time mind-wandering (i.e., under the sway of the default-mode network)?', 'Clearly, people are positively motivated to pursue goals (by definition!), which must limit the amount of time they spend mind-wandering.', ""There is extensive reason to believe that a sense that one's life is meaningful depends on having attractive, attainable goals and that this is necessary for sustained mental health (Klinger, 1977(#AUTHOR_TAG , 2012."", 'The absence of such goals leads to boredom, depressed moods, excessive entertainment, and substance use.', 'People strive for a balance between active goal pursuit and inner life such as ordinary mind-wandering and imaginative daydreaming, which are themselves goal-related.', 'There are large individual differences in the amount of time that people desire to spend in imaginative daydreaming (Singer and Bonanno, 1990;Singer, 1966Singer, , 1975Bigelsen and Schupak, 2011), some valuing it as a resource for self-amusement and stimulation and others eager to reduce or eliminate it but unable to attain a daydream-free state.']",0,"[""There is extensive reason to believe that a sense that one's life is meaningful depends on having attractive, attainable goals and that this is necessary for sustained mental health (Klinger, 1977(#AUTHOR_TAG , 2012.""]"

CC1194,33121562,The numerical relativity breakthrough for binary black holes,Ulrich Sperhake,Gravitational Radiation from Black Hole Spacetimes Ph,"[""L Lehner""]","The problem of detecting gravitational radiation is receiving considerable attention with the construction of new detectors in the United States, Europe and Japan. The theoretical modeling of the wave forms that would be produced in particular systems will expedite the search and analysis of the detected signals. Furthermore, these models will also help to shed light on our understanding of these sources. The most promising candidates to produce gravitational radiation of detectable amplitude are systems containing black holes or neutron stars. The strong-field associated with these systems allow us ignore the influence of distant matter and study the problem as if the source were isolated. Although this assumption simplifies the treatment of the problem, because of the structure of Einstein's equations, an analytical study is almost impossible. Also, perturbative analysis will be grossly inaccurate because of the strong fields present near the source. Hence, numerical techniques must be employed for a correct description of the system. In this work, a numerical implementation of Einstein's equations is presented in a characteristic formulation, which is particularly useful to study the propagation of gravitational wave forms through spacetime. The characteristic formulation of GR is implemented to obtain an algorithm capable of evolving black holes in 3D asymptotically flat spacetimes. Using compactification techniques, future null infinity is included in the evolved region, which enables the unambiguous calculation of the radiation produced by some compact source. A module to calculate the waveforms is constructed and included in the evolution algorithm. This code is shown to be second-order convergent and to handle highly non-linear spacetimes. In particular, we have shown that the code can handle spacetimes whose radiation is equivalent to a galaxy converting its whole mass into gravitational radiation in one second. We further use the characteristic formulation to treat the region close to the singularity in black hole spacetimes. The code carefully excises a region surrounding the singularity and accurately evolves generic black hole spacetimes with apparently unlimited stability.","Codes based on the characteristic formulation have been applied with great success in the presence of special spacetime symmetries and indeed been the first to model single BH spacetimes with long-term stability [12,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['It is instructive to count the number of physical degrees of freedom contained in the system ( 18)- (21).', 'We have ten components of the Einstein metric g ���_ corresponding to the ten functions �_ ij , �_ i and �� in the ADM formulation.', 'Four of these, the lapse and shift, are freely specifiable and do not contain physical information.', 'The constraints impose four further conditions on the remaining functions �_ ij that must be satisfied on each hypersurface �� t and we are left with two gravitational degrees of freedom which correspond to the + and �� GW polarization modes; see e.g.', '[8].', 'The two gravitational degrees of freedom are recovered even more elegantly in the characteristic formulation of the Einstein equations developed by Bondi, Sachs and collaborators [9,10].', 'Here, one chooses at least one coordinate to be null and thus foliates spacetime in terms of light cones.', 'The Einstein equations assume a natural hierarchy of 2 evolution equations, 4 hypersurface equations relating variables inside the hypersurfaces, 3 supplementary and 1 trivial equation; for details see [11] and references therein.', 'Codes based on the characteristic formulation have been applied with great success in the presence of special spacetime symmetries and indeed been the first to model single BH spacetimes with long-term stability [12,#AUTHOR_TAG].', ""In spite of the formalism's appealing properties, however, characteristic codes have as yet not been successfully generalized to BH binaries because the formation of caustics causes a breakdown of the coordinate system."", 'It remains to be seen whether this obstacle can be overcome in future investigations; for a recent study see [14].']",0,"['Codes based on the characteristic formulation have been applied with great success in the presence of special spacetime symmetries and indeed been the first to model single BH spacetimes with long-term stability [12,#AUTHOR_TAG].']"

General relativity is assumed to be the correct theory of gravity and the Einstein field equations are studied in their canonical form. A comparison is made of the initial value and evolution equations for gravity in different formalisms (ADM, geometry of spacelike hypersurfaces, timelike congruences). These equations are then illustrated by a number of cosmological and black hole space-times. A study of coordinate conditions is undertaken. The axisymmetric (non-stationary and non-spherical) Einstein equations are discussed, and it is shown how to set up a numerical computer program to integrate these equations starting with a given initial data set. Various applications of this computer approach are discussed: collapse of rotating non-spherical stars, ""runaway"" collapse, and headon collisions of black holes. All of these situations would involve generation of gravitational radiation from the formation of black holes. The particular case of two nonrotating black holes colliding headon is chosen as a test case for the computer. The initial value problem is reviewed and then a computer program is written to generate the spacetime. This generation involves solving four coupled quasilinear hyperbolic (evolution) equations and one linear elliptic equation (maximal slicing) on each spacelike sheet. The numerical difficulties are discussed and graphical methods are used to present the result of the computations.","Starting in the late 1960s, the problem was reinvestigated in an effort initiated by DeWitt which led to PhD theses by��ade�_, Smarr and Eppley [142]#AUTHOR_TAG[144].","['Starting in the late 1960s, the problem was reinvestigated in an effort initiated by DeWitt which led to PhD theses by��ade�_, Smarr and Eppley [142]#AUTHOR_TAG[144].', 'These works implemented the ADM equations in axisymmetry using a specific type of coordinates often referred to as��ade�_ coordinates and thus evolved head-on collisions starting with Misner data, testing several gauge conditions including maximal slicing, vanishing shift and minimal distortion shift.', 'Their equal-mass head-on collisions predict a GW energy of about 0.1 % of the total mass, albeit with uncertainties of a factor a few; for details see [36,145,146].', 'This value turned out to be correct within a factor of about 2.']",0,"['Starting in the late 1960s, the problem was reinvestigated in an effort initiated by DeWitt which led to PhD theses by��ade�_, Smarr and Eppley [142]#AUTHOR_TAG[144].', 'These works implemented the ADM equations in axisymmetry using a specific type of coordinates often referred to asade_ coordinates and thus evolved head-on collisions starting with Misner data, testing several gauge conditions including maximal slicing, vanishing shift and minimal distortion shift.', 'Their equal-mass head-on collisions predict a GW energy of about 0.1 % of the total mass, albeit with uncertainties of a factor a few; for details see [36,145,146].', 'This value turned out to be correct within a factor of about 2.']"

However, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions corresponding to a specified maximum warming are poorly known owing to uncertainties in the carbon cycle and the climate response. Here we provide a comprehensive probabilistic analysis aimed at quantifying GHG emission budgets for the 2000-50 period that would limit warming throughout the twenty-first century to below 2degC, based on a combination of published distributions of climate system properties and observational constraints. We show that, for the chosen class of emission scenarios, both cumulative emissions up to 2050 and emissions levels in 2050 are robust indicators of the probability that twenty-first century warming will not exceed 2degC relative to pre-industrial temperatures. Limiting cumulative CO2 emissions over 2000-50 to 1,000 Gt CO2 yields a 25% probability of warming exceeding 2degC - and a limit of 1,440 Gt CO2 yields a 50% probability - given a representative estimate of the distribution of climate system properties. As known 2000-06 CO2 emissions were ~234 Gt CO2 less than half the proven economically recoverable oil, gas and coal reserves can still be emitted up to 2050 to achieve such a goal. Recent G8 Communiques envisage halved global GHG emissions by 2050, for which we estimate at 12-45% probability of exceeding 2degC - assuming 1990 as emission base year and a range of published climate sensitivity distributions. Emissions levels in 2020 are a less robust indicator, but for the scenarios considered, the probability of exceeding 2degC rises to 53-87% if global GHG emissions are still more than 25% above 2000 levels in 2020",The stringency of the lower target is consistent with concurrent interpretations of the goal to keep global mean warming below 2��C ( #AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009).,"['The policy variations included two different target levels of radiative forcing corresponding to atmospheric concentrations of 450 and 550 ppm CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 e) which represent a range of potential long-term goals of international climate policy.', 'The stringency of the lower target is consistent with concurrent interpretations of the goal to keep global mean warming below 2��C ( #AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009).', 'In EMF27, the limit was imposed on the combined radiative forcing from all radiative agents of anthropogenic origin with the exception of nitrate aerosols, mineral dust aerosols, and land use albedo changes (which we call AN3A forcing).', 'The lower 450 limit was set to 2.8 W/m 2 allowing for overshoot before 2100, while the higher 550 limit was set to 3.7 W/m 2 that was not to be exceeded during the 21 st century (Blanford et al. this issue).']",0,"['The policy variations included two different target levels of radiative forcing corresponding to atmospheric concentrations of 450 and 550 ppm CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 e) which represent a range of potential long-term goals of international climate policy.', 'The stringency of the lower target is consistent with concurrent interpretations of the goal to keep global mean warming below 2��C ( #AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009).']"

A paradigm shift toward more holistic policy approaches supported by a new generation of integrated decision-making tools is thus needed. These tools merit a reconsideration of the traditional, fragmented energy policy framework. Our analysis of a large ensemble of alternate energy-climate futures, developed using MESSAGE, an integrated assessment model with considerable technological detail of the global energy system, shows that climate change policy offers a strategic entry point along the path to energy sustainability in several dimensions. Decarbonization will lead to improved air quality, thereby reducing energy-related health impacts worldwide.

Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics.

CC1227,93144659,A Review of Psychometric Data Analysis and Applications,Geraldine Gray,Paradigm shift to the integrative big five trait taxonomy History measurement and conceptual issues,"[""Oliver P. John"", ""Laura P. Naumann""]","The first version of this chapter (John, 1990) offered a comprehensive and detailed review of most of the available research. This is no longer possible as we are writing this chapter in 2007. What has happened? Figure 4.1 uses publication trends over the past 25 years to illustrate how fundamentally the field has changed. Specifically, we show the number of publications related to the Big Five personality traits for each 5-year interval, beginning in the early 1980s, obtained from keyword searches of the PsycINFO database. To provide a comparison, we also show the publication trend for the influential models developed earlier by Cattell and by Eysenck. Although both were then close to retirement age, their influence had continued during the 1980s. In fact, both Cattell (1990) and Eysenck (1990) had written chapters on personality traits for the first edition of this handbook. What did we expect to find? Our intuitions suggested that publications on the Big Five had increased substantially since the mid-1980s, with Cattell's and Eysenck's influence decreasing. But we were surprised by the data. First, the ascent of the Big Five happened much more gradually than we had expected, and Cattell's and Eysenck's influence held steady much longer. As Figure 4.1 shows, it took until the late 1990s for the number of Big Five publications to finally overtake the two older models. Second, whereas references to Cattell and Eysenck models have finally begun to decline in absolute numbers, their decline has been small compared to the amazing increase in research publications on the Big Five. By 2006, the last year for which we had figures available, the number of Big Five publications exceeded 300 per year, compared with less than 50 for the two older models. In the 9 years since the previous version of this chapter (John & Srivastava, 1999) was completed, almost 2,000 new publications on the Big Five have appeared. As a result, we can now cover only a small fraction of all the relevant work in this chapter. Our main goal remains to provide a general overview and introduction to the field that focuses on the main issues and can serve as a useful reference resource. We therefore refer the reader to more specialized sources or reviews as needed. We begin our chapter with the history of the Big Five, including the discovery of the five dimensions, research replicating and extending the model, its convergence with research in the questionnaire tradition, and the development of several instruments to measure the Big Five. Then we compare three of the most frequently used instruments and discuss some new data regarding their reliability and validity. Finally, we address a number of conceptual issues, including how the Big Five taxonomy is structured hierarchically, how the five dimensions develop, whether they predict important life outcomes, and whether they are descriptive or explanatory concepts.","Theories of temperament focus on aspects of personality discernible at birth (Boeree, 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008).","['Theories of temperament focus on aspects of personality discernible at birth (Boeree, 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008).', 'Historically, research that links temperament with academic achievement has lacked a welldefined referential framework for the interactions between temperament and academic performance.', 'Studies have varied in their perspective of personality, with diverse views on the relevant traits to be considered as measures of temperament, such as factors of persistence, factors relating to motivation and/or moral factors such as honesty (de Raad & Schouwenburg, 1996).', 'While many factors are associated with temperament, factor analysis by a number of researchers, working independently and using different approaches, has resulted in broad agreement of five main personality dimensions (Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997;Boeree, 2006;John et al., 2008).', 'These are commonly referred to as the Big Five (Cattell & Mead, 2008;Goldberg, 1992Goldberg, , 1993Tupes & Cristal, 1961) or the related Five-Factor Model (Costa & McCrae, 1992).', 'The five factors -openness, agreeableness, extroversion, conscientiousness, and neuroticism -are described in Table 3. 1 High School Grade Point Average (HSGPA) is a secondary school, end-of-year, aggregate measure of academic performance, which can be a combination of continuous assessment results and end of term exams. 2 ACT tests are based on high school curriculum in English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science (www.act.org).']",0,"['Theories of temperament focus on aspects of personality discernible at birth (Boeree, 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008).', 'Historically, research that links temperament with academic achievement has lacked a welldefined referential framework for the interactions between temperament and academic performance.', 'Studies have varied in their perspective of personality, with diverse views on the relevant traits to be considered as measures of temperament, such as factors of persistence, factors relating to motivation and/or moral factors such as honesty (de Raad & Schouwenburg, 1996).', 'While many factors are associated with temperament, factor analysis by a number of researchers, working independently and using different approaches, has resulted in broad agreement of five main personality dimensions (Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997;Boeree, 2006;John et al., 2008).', 'These are commonly referred to as the Big Five (Cattell & Mead, 2008;Goldberg, 1992Goldberg, , 1993Tupes & Cristal, 1961) or the related Five-Factor Model (Costa & McCrae, 1992).', 'The five factors -openness, agreeableness, extroversion, conscientiousness, and neuroticism -are described in Table 3. 1 High School Grade Point Average (HSGPA) is a secondary school, end-of-year, aggregate measure of academic performance, which can be a combination of continuous assessment results and end of term exams. 2 ACT tests are based on high school curriculum in English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science (www.act.org).']"

It is suggested that motivational patterns may contribute to gender differences in mathematics achievement and that empirically based interventions may prevent current achievement discrepancies and provide a basis for more effective socialization.","Such achievement goals fall into two categories: performance goals, where an individual is looking for favourable feedback, and learning goals, where an individual desires to increase competency (Covington, 2000;#AUTHOR_TAG, 1986;Dweck & Leggett, 1988;Eccles & Wigfield, 2002;Eppler & Harju, 1997).","['High self-efficacy is associated with a student setting challenging goals in terms of academic achievement.', 'Such achievement goals fall into two categories: performance goals, where an individual is looking for favourable feedback, and learning goals, where an individual desires to increase competency (Covington, 2000;#AUTHOR_TAG, 1986;Dweck & Leggett, 1988;Eccles & Wigfield, 2002;Eppler & Harju, 1997).']",0,"['Such achievement goals fall into two categories: performance goals, where an individual is looking for favourable feedback, and learning goals, where an individual desires to increase competency (Covington, 2000;#AUTHOR_TAG, 1986;Dweck & Leggett, 1988;Eccles & Wigfield, 2002;Eppler & Harju, 1997).']"

Undergraduates (407) completed the Motivated Strategies Learning Questionnaire, Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale, Achievement Goal Inventory, and self-reported grade point average. A MANCOVA (controlling for sex and age) indicated that low self-efficacy students tended to believe intelligence is innate and unchangeable and high self-efficacy students pursued mastery goals involving challenge and gaining new knowledge as well as performance goals involving good grades and outperforming others. Further, hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that self-efficacy, effort regulation, and help-seeking predicted 18% of the variance in GPA. Interestingly, effort regulation partially mediated the relationship between self-efficacy and GPA. Overall, self-efficacious students are able to achieve academically because they monitor and self-regulate their impulses and persist in the face of difficulties.

A sample of 262 undergraduate students, ranging in age from 18 to 25 years and including 122 males and 140 females, completed the Motivational Style Profile (MSP), the Enright Forgiveness Inventory (EFI), the Willingness to Forgive Scale (WFS), and a Time-Factor Questionnaire (TFQ) that was designed for this study. The forgiveness ratings of the participants who achieved high-dominance in arousal-avoidance were compared to those of the participants who achieved high-dominance in arousal-seeking. Similarly, the forgiveness ratings of the participants who achieved high-dominance in autic sympathy were compared to those of the participants who achieved high-dominance in autic mastery. Despite differential expectations, there were no significant differences between these groups on the measures of forgiveness. Numerous conceptual and methodological factors that might account for the findings were identified. With respect to the methodological issues pertaining to the MSP, the high inter-correlations between the MSP subscales rendered it difficult to identify distinct factors. There were also methodological concerns related to the measures that were used to assess forgiveness. For example, the number of times participants selected forgiveness solutions as problem-solving strategies on each of the WFS subscales was too low to be useful. The one robust finding in this study came from the addition of the TFQ, which added the dimension of time to the WFS scenarios. The participants consistently indicated that they would be increasingly likely to forgive with the passage of time.Dept. of Psychology.

The findings revealed a positive indirect effect of neuroticism on academic performance at higher levels of self-efficacy, complemented by a positive direct effect of neuroticism at lower levels of self-efficacy.

Using confirmatory factor analyses tests of equivalency were conducted that contrasted non-traditional Navajo students and females with near traditional Navajo students and males. Using structural equation modeling, I examined the relations of the language, location, and gender variables on the achievement goal factors, mediated by school measures of achievement, ability beliefs, social goals and achievement goals. I concluded that non-traditional and near traditional Navajo students are more similar than dissimilar. Clearly this raises concerns regarding the making of policy based on assumptions regarding presumed differences between non-traditional and near traditional Navajo High School students.

There have recently been several empirical comparisons as to which types of student models are better at predicting future performance, both within and outside of the interactive learning environment. However, these comparisons have produced contradictory results. Within this paper, we examine whether ensemble methods, which integrate multiple models, can produce prediction results comparable to or better than the best of nine student modeling frameworks, taken individually. We ensemble model predictions within a Cognitive Tutor for Genetics, at the level of predicting knowledge action-by-action within the tutor. We evaluate the predictions in terms of future performance within the tutor and on a paper post-test. Within this data set, we do not find evidence that ensembles of models are significantly better. Ensembles of models perform comparably to or slightly better than the best individual models, at predicting future performance within the tutor software. However, the ensembles of models perform marginally significantly worse than the best individual models, at predicting post-test performance.

Equipping K-16 students with these twenty-first-century competencies requires new thinking not only about what should be taught in school but also about how to develop valid assessments to measure and support these competencies. In Stealth Assessment, Valerie Shute and Matthew Ventura investigate an approach that embeds performance-based assessments in digital games. They argue that using well-designed games as vehicles to assess and support learning will help combat students' growing disengagement from school, provide dynamic and ongoing measures of learning processes and outcomes, and offer students opportunities to apply such complex competencies as creativity, problem solving, persistence, and collaboration. Embedding assessments within games provides a way to monitor players' progress toward targeted competencies and to use that information to support learning.Shute and Ventura discuss problems with such traditional assessment methods as multiple-choice questions, review evidence relating to digital games and learning, and illustrate the stealth-assessment approach with a set of assessments they are developing and embedding in the digital game Newton's Playground. These stealth assessments are intended to measure levels of creativity, persistence, and conceptual understanding of Newtonian physics during game play.

One hundred and seventy-nine girls from multi-ethnic, mixed socioeconomic status families residing in a major metropolitan area of the United States were studied in a parochial school that emphasized homework in the curriculum with more than 3 h of work assigned daily. Path analyses showed significant paths (a) from homework experiences to the girls' self-efficacy for learning beliefs and their perception of student responsibility for academic outcomes, and (b) from these two academic beliefs to the girls' academic grade point average at the end of the school term. The implications of these findings for future research and school policy will be discussed.","Such learners must also accept delayed gratification as self-regulation requires students to focus on long-term gains for their effort (Bembenutty, 2009;Komarraju & Nadler, 2013;Zimmerman, 1990;#AUTHOR_TAG & Kitsantas, 2005).","['Self-regulated learning is recognized as a complex concept that overlaps with a number of other concepts including temperament, learning approach, and motivation, specifically self-efficacy and goal setting (Bidjerano & Dai, 2007;Boekaerts, 1996).', 'While many students may set goals, the ability to selfregulate learning can be the difference between achieving, or not achieving, the goals set (Covington, 2000).', 'Self-regulated learners take responsibility for setting and achieving their own learning goals by planning their learning, having effective time management, using appropriate learning strategies, continually monitoring and evaluating the quality of their own learning, and altering their learning strategies when required (Schunk, 2005;Zimmerman, 1990).', 'Such learners regard learning as a process they can control, but their motivation factors can vary (Pintrich & DeGroot, 1990).', 'To be motivated to self-regulate, a learner must be confident in setting goals and organizing study, and also be confident that study efforts will result in good marks (high self-efficacy).', 'Such learners must also accept delayed gratification as self-regulation requires students to focus on long-term gains for their effort (Bembenutty, 2009;Komarraju & Nadler, 2013;Zimmerman, 1990;#AUTHOR_TAG & Kitsantas, 2005).', 'Volet (1996) argues that self-regulated learning is more significant in the tertiary level than earlier levels of education because of the shift from a teacher-controlled environment to one of self-regulated study.']",0,"['Self-regulated learning is recognized as a complex concept that overlaps with a number of other concepts including temperament, learning approach, and motivation, specifically self-efficacy and goal setting (Bidjerano & Dai, 2007;Boekaerts, 1996).', 'While many students may set goals, the ability to selfregulate learning can be the difference between achieving, or not achieving, the goals set (Covington, 2000).', 'Self-regulated learners take responsibility for setting and achieving their own learning goals by planning their learning, having effective time management, using appropriate learning strategies, continually monitoring and evaluating the quality of their own learning, and altering their learning strategies when required (Schunk, 2005;Zimmerman, 1990).', 'Such learners regard learning as a process they can control, but their motivation factors can vary (Pintrich & DeGroot, 1990).', 'To be motivated to self-regulate, a learner must be confident in setting goals and organizing study, and also be confident that study efforts will result in good marks (high self-efficacy).', 'Such learners must also accept delayed gratification as self-regulation requires students to focus on long-term gains for their effort (Bembenutty, 2009;Komarraju & Nadler, 2013;Zimmerman, 1990;#AUTHOR_TAG & Kitsantas, 2005).', 'Volet (1996) argues that self-regulated learning is more significant in the tertiary level than earlier levels of education because of the shift from a teacher-controlled environment to one of self-regulated study.']"

It is suggested that, although this may appear to be a simple aim, it is not necessarily understood or applied by university academics in their teaching.

CC1266,93144659,A Review of Psychometric Data Analysis and Applications,Geraldine Gray,CHC theory and the human cognitive abilities project: Standing on the shoulders of the giants of psychometric intelligence research,"[""Kevin S. McGrew""]","Abstract During the past decade the Cattell-Horn Gf-Gc and Carroll Three-Stratum models have emerged as the consensus psychometric-based models for understanding the structure of human intelligence. Although the two models differ in a number of ways, the strong correspondence between the two models has resulted in the increased use of a broad umbrella term for a synthesis of the two models (Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of cognitive abilities--CHC theory). The purpose of this editorial is three-fold. First, I will describe the CHC framework and recommend that intelligence researchers begin using the CHC taxonomy as a common nomenclature for describing research findings and a theoretical framework from which to test hypotheses regarding various aspects of human cognitive abilities. Second, I argue that the emergence of the CHC framework should not be viewed as the capstone to the psychometric era of factor analytic research. Rather, I recommend the CHC framework serve as the stepping stone to reinvigorate the investigation of the structure of human intelligence. Finally, the Woodcock-Munoz Foundation Human Cognitive Abilities (HCA) project, which is an evolving, free, on-line electronic archive of the majority of datasets analyzed in Carroll's (1993) seminal treatise on factor analysis of human cognitive abilities, is introduced and described. Intelligence scholars are urged to access the Carroll HCA datasets to test and evaluate structural models of human intelligence with contemporary methods (confirmatory factor analysis). In addition, suggestions are offered for linking the analysis of contemporary data sets with the seminal work of Carroll. The emergence of a consensus CHC taxonomy and access to the original datasets analyzed by Carroll provides an unprecedented opportunity to extend and refine our understanding of human intelligence.","Recently the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory of cognitive abilities has gained recognition as a taxonomy of cognitive intelligence (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2009).","['Cognitive ability tests were originally developed to identify low academic achievers (Jensen, 1981;Munzert, 1980).', 'The first such test measured general cognitive intelligence, g, as identified by Spearman (1904Spearman ( , 1927.', 'Test results for an individual across a range of cognitive measures tend to correlate providing good evidence for a single measure of intelligence (Jensen, 1981;Kuncel, Hezlett, & Ones, 2004).', 'In addition to general cognitive intelligence, there is widespread evidence for a multi-dimensional construct of intelligence comprising of a range of sub-factors (Flanagan & McGrew, 1998).', 'Abilities in such sub-factors vary from one individual to another, and vary within an individual across factors, in other words, an individual can have higher ability in one sub-factor than in another (Spearman, 1927, p. 75).', 'Recently the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory of cognitive abilities has gained recognition as a taxonomy of cognitive intelligence (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2009).', 'The CHC is based on ten broad cognitive categories, summarized in Table 1.']",0,"['Recently the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory of cognitive abilities has gained recognition as a taxonomy of cognitive intelligence (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2009).']"

Sargent""]","BACKGROUND In recent years, considerable attention has been given to the development of sophisticated techniques for exploring data sets. One such class of techniques is artificial neural networks (ANNs). Artificial neural networks have many attractive theoretic properties, specifically, the ability to detect non predefined relations such as nonlinear effects and/or interactions. These theoretic advantages come at the cost of reduced interpretability of the model output. Many authors have analyzed the same data set, based on these factors, with both standard statistical methods (such as logistic or Cox regression) and ANN. METHODS The goal of this work is to review the literature comparing the performance of ANN with standard statistical techniques when applied to medium to large data sets (sample size > 200 patients). A thorough literature search was performed, with specific criteria for a published comparison to be included in this review. RESULTS In the 28 studies included in this review, ANN outperformed regression in 10 cases (36%), was outperformed by regression in 4 cases (14%), and the 2 methods had similar performance in the remaining 14 cases (50%). However, in the 8 largest studies (sample size > 5000), regression and ANN tied in 7 cases, with regression winning in the remaining case. In addition, there is some suggestion of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS Neither method achieves the desired performance. Both methods should continue to be used and explored in a complementary manner. However, based on the available data, ANN should not replace standard statistical approaches as the method of choice for the classification of medical data.

The research described includes sport-specific research but also studies that focus on general motivational principles that look beyond sport-specific phenomena. We propose that attentional, rather than limited resource, explanations of self-control have more value for athletic performance. Moreover, we integrate self-control ideas with descriptions of motivational phenomena to derive novel hypotheses concerning how self-control can be optimized during sport performance. We explain how minimizing desire-goal conflicts by fusing self-control processes and performance goals can delay aversive consequences of self-control that may impede performance. We also suggest that autonomous performance goals are an important motivational input that enhances the effectiveness of self-control processes by a) reducing the salience of the desire to reduce performance-related discomfort, b) increasing attentional resources towards optimal performance, and c) optimizing monitoring and modification of self-control processes. These extensions to knowledge help map out empirical agenda which may drive theoretical advances and deepen understanding of how to improve self-control during performance","Defining how learners are motivated to behave in a certain way, and more specifically to learn, is more complex, and is characterized by a range of complementary theories that aim to explain both the level of individual motivation and the nature of the motivation (#AUTHOR_TAG & Konig, 2006).","['Ryan and Deci ( 2000) define motivation simply as being ""moved to do something.""', 'Defining how learners are motivated to behave in a certain way, and more specifically to learn, is more complex, and is characterized by a range of complementary theories that aim to explain both the level of individual motivation and the nature of the motivation (#AUTHOR_TAG & Konig, 2006).', 'Current theories in turn encompass a number of factors, some of which are relevant, directly or indirectly, to academic performance (Robbins et al., 2004).', 'Informed by the categorization of motivation theories relevant to academic achievement proposed by Robbins et al.

The aim of the research was to evaluate students' approaches to learning as measured by a study process questionnaire (SPQ). The questionnaire is viewed as a reliable and valid measure of students' learning, and has been used extensively with students in higher education in Australia. The SPQ is a 42-item questionnaire measuring surface, deep and achieving approaches to learning. It was distributed to 300 student nurses attending the common foundation program of a preregistration-nursing course. Data were entered into SPSS Windows Release 10. The results indicated that many of the students were taking a surface approach or surface-achieving approach to their studies. There was little difference in results between undergraduates and diploma students or between students majoring in different nursing specialties. The deep and achieving approaches to learning scores correlated positively and significantly with overall mean assessment scores of students, the deep approach with Sociology scores and negatively and significantly with Psychology scores.

The task involved a collaborative computer-based modeling task. In order to test the model, group measures of mastery-approach goal orientation, performance-avoidance goal orientation, self-efficacy, and achievement were employed. Students' cognitive processing was assessed using an online log-file measure. As predicted, mastery-approach goal orientation had a significant positive effect on achievement, which was mediated through students' use of deep processes. No significant relationships could be found between performance-avoidance goal orientation and surface processing and between surface processing and achievement.

As a generalisation of deterministic fuzzy systems, Mamdani probabilistic fuzzy systems better model practical complex systems involving uncertainty because they combine the interpretability of fuzzy systems with the statistical properties of probabilistic systems. Using probabilistic fuzzy rules, both probabilistic uncertainty and linguistic ambiguity are handled simultaneously with a single framework. Considering that the information available often consists of a training set of inputÐoutput data pairs, a general method for generating Mamdani probabilistic fuzzy rule bases from numerical data pairs is presented. A fuzzy reasoning method is used on the generated probabilistic fuzzy rule base to derive a map leading from the input space to the output space, and a probabilistic fuzzy system is constructed. We use this probabilistic fuzzy modelling method for nonlinear regression analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a comparison with similar regression techniques.","This non-deterministic model of the data can represent more complex, non-linear class boundaries (Otero & S��nchez, 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012).","['Rule-based classifiers define class membership based on a set of if_�_then_�_ rules.', 'Basic implementations generate models similar to a decision tree model (Tan et al., 2006) despite the difference in search strategies used.', 'Rule-based classifiers implement a depth first search; decision trees implement a breath first search (Gupta & Toshniwal, 2011).', 'However, rule-based classifiers can be extended to incorporate fuzzy rules with less precise conditions, allowing an instance to match more than one class.', 'For example ""if Conscientiousness is \'very\' good and Self-Efficacy is \'fairly\' good then atRisk = False"" uses the fuzzy sets ""very"" and ""fairly"" instead of specific value ranges.', 'This non-deterministic model of the data can represent more complex, non-linear class boundaries (Otero & S��nchez, 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012).']",0,"['Rule-based classifiers define class membership based on a set of if__then__ rules.', 'Basic implementations generate models similar to a decision tree model (Tan et al., 2006) despite the difference in search strategies used.', 'Rule-based classifiers implement a depth first search; decision trees implement a breath first search (Gupta & Toshniwal, 2011).', 'However, rule-based classifiers can be extended to incorporate fuzzy rules with less precise conditions, allowing an instance to match more than one class.', 'This non-deterministic model of the data can represent more complex, non-linear class boundaries (Otero & S��nchez, 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012).']"

While the validity of school grades and admission tests has been investigated by meta-analyses and large-scale studies at least in the United States, less is known about noncognitive predictors of academic success. The present meta-analysis investigates the impact of the Big Five personality factors on academic success at university. A total of 258 correlation coefficients from 58 studies published since 1980 were included. Grades, retention, and satisfaction served as success criteria. Correlations were corrected for attenuation caused by measurement error. Results show that the influence of personality traits on academic achievement depends on the success criterion. While Neuroticism is related to academic satisfaction (_^_ = –.369, k = 8), Conscientiousness correlates with grades (_^_ = .269, k = 41). Extraversion, Openness to Experience, and Agreeableness have no significant impact on academic success. Moderator analyses suggest effects of culture for the validity of Extraversion. Parallels to validity for job performance are identified and implications for admission and counseling of students are discussed.","There is a consensus across studies that conscientiousness is the best personality-based predictor of academic performance (O'Connor & Paunonen, 2007;Swanberg & Martinsen, 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007).","['Chamorro- Premuzic & Furnham (2004) found that personality attributes measured using the big five construct accounted for up to 30% of the variance in academic performance at tertiary level education.', ""There is a consensus across studies that conscientiousness is the best personality-based predictor of academic performance (O'Connor & Paunonen, 2007;Swanberg & Martinsen, 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007)."", 'Many researchers have cited conscientiousness as compensating for lower cognitive intelligence (see Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2004, and it is a consistent predictor of academic performance across assessment type (Allick & Realo, 1997;Kappe & van der Flier, 2010;Shute & Ventura, 2013).', 'Some significant correlations between openness and academic performance have been reported, but correlations with academic performance are not as high (see Table 4).', 'Openness is considered by Chamorro-Premuzic and Furnham (2008) to be a mediator between ability and academic performance.', 'Openness in turn is mediated by learning approach, with open personalities being more likely to adopt a deep learning strategy, which in turn improves academic performance (Swanberg & Martinsen, 2010).', 'Sub-factors of openness, namely intellectual curiosity, creativity, and open-mindedness, have been associated with effective thinking and learning dispositions (Buckingham Shum & Deakin Crick, 2012;Tishman, Jay & Perkins, 1993).', 'Knight et al.

CC1287,93144659,A Review of Psychometric Data Analysis and Applications,Geraldine Gray,Learning analytics Challenges paradoxes and opportunities for mega open distance learning institutions,"[""Paul Prinsloo"", ""Sharon Slade"", ""Fenella Galpin""]","Despite all the research on student retention and success since the first conceptual mappings of student success e.g. Spady [12], there have not been equal impacts on the rates of both student success and retention. To realise the potential of learning analytics to impact on student retention and success, mega open distance learning (ODL) institutions face a number of challenges, paradoxes and opportunities. For the purpose of this paper we critique a 'closed' view of learning analytics as focusing only on data produced by students' interactions with institutions of higher learning. Students are not the only actors in their learning journeys and it would seem crucial that learning analytics also includes the impacts of all stakeholders on students' learning journeys in order to increase the success of students' learning. As such the notion of 'Thirdspace' as used by cultural, postmodern and identity theorists provide a useful heuristic to map the challenges and opportunities, but also the paradoxes of learning analytics and its potential impact on student success and retention. This paper explores some of these challenges, paradoxes and opportunities with reference to two mega ODL institutions namely the Open University in the UK (OU) and the University of South Africa (Unisa). Although these two institutions share a number of characteristics, there are also some major and important differences between them. We explore some of the shared challenges, paradoxes and opportunities learning analytics offer in the context of these two institutions.

In this work, Logitboost is applied to learn fuzzy rules in classification problems, and its results are compared with that of Adaboost and other fuzzy rule learning algorithms. Contradicting the expected results, it is shown that the basic extension of the backfitting algorithm to learn classification rules may produce worse results than Adaboost does. We suggest that this is caused by the stricter requirements that Logitboost demands to the weak learners, which are not fulfilled by fuzzy rules.

To examine this issue, 63 undergraduate students completed a series of questionnaires measuring self-efficacy and motivation before 5 class exams.

D. H. M. (1992). Leerstijlen en sturen van leerprocessen in het hoger onderwijs. (Learning styles and guidance of learning processes in higher education) . Amsterdam/Lisse: Swets and Zeitlinger] postulated four different learning styles: a meaning directed, a reproduction directed, an application directed and an undirected style. Aim of this project is to investigate the relation between these learning styles, the big five personality traits and achievement motivation. Subjects were about 900 university students. Extraversion correlated positively with the meaning directed, reproduction directed and application directed learning style. Conscientiousness was associated positively with the meaning, reproduction and application directed learning style, and negatively with the undirected learning style. Openness to experience correlated positively with the meaning and application directed learning style, and negatively with the undirected learning style. Besides, it was found that neuroticism correlated positively with the undirected learning style and negatively with the meaning and reproduction directed learning style. Agreeableness was associated positively with the reproduction and application directed learning style. Positive correlations were found for achievement motivation with the meaning, reproduction and the application directed learning style, and a negative one with the undirected learning style. Regression analyses confirmed these patterns. Although there was some systematic overlap for the four learning styles with personality variables and achievement motivation, the conclusion is that it certainly makes sense to measure these three groups of variables separately in educational settings.","Openness, conscientiousness, and intrinsic motivation are correlated with a deep learning approach, while neuroticism, agreeableness, and extrinsic motivation are associated with a shallow learning approach (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1999;Duff et al., 2004;Marton & S�_lj�_, 2005).","['Approaches to learning have their foundation in the work of Marton and S�_lj�_ (2005) who classified learners as shallow or deep.', 'Deep learners aim to understand content, while shallow learners aim to memorize content regardless of their level of understanding.', 'Later studies added strategic learners as a third category (Entwhistle;2005, p. 19) whose priority is to do well, and will adopt either a shallow or a deep learning approach, depending on the requisites for academic success.', 'Both personality and selfdetermined motivation are indicative of personal approaches to learning.', 'Openness, conscientiousness, and intrinsic motivation are correlated with a deep learning approach, while neuroticism, agreeableness, and extrinsic motivation are associated with a shallow learning approach (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1999;Duff et al., 2004;Marton & S�_lj�_, 2005).', 'Many studies concur with a negative correlation between a shallow learning approach and academic performance (see summary in Table 8).', 'Some studies show higher correlations between academic performance and a deep learning approach (e.g., Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2008;Snelgrove, 2004), while others cite marginally higher correlations with a strategic learning approach (e.g., Cassidy, 2011;Duff et al., 2004).', 'Volet (1996) found the importance of learning approach varied with assessment type.', 'A lack of correlation between a deep learning approach and academic performance is in itself an insightful result, as it suggests an assessment design that fails to reward an important, malleable learning disposition (Buckingham Shum & Deakin Crick, 2012;Knight et al., 2013), and hence, may elicit secondary, follow-up actions.']",0,"['Openness, conscientiousness, and intrinsic motivation are correlated with a deep learning approach, while neuroticism, agreeableness, and extrinsic motivation are associated with a shallow learning approach (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1999;Duff et al., 2004;Marton & S�_lj�_, 2005).', 'Many studies concur with a negative correlation between a shallow learning approach and academic performance (see summary in Table 8).', 'Some studies show higher correlations between academic performance and a deep learning approach (e.g., Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2008;Snelgrove, 2004), while others cite marginally higher correlations with a strategic learning approach (e.g., Cassidy, 2011;Duff et al., 2004).', 'Volet (1996) found the importance of learning approach varied with assessment type.', 'A lack of correlation between a deep learning approach and academic performance is in itself an insightful result, as it suggests an assessment design that fails to reward an important, malleable learning disposition (Buckingham Shum & Deakin Crick, 2012;Knight et al., 2013), and hence, may elicit secondary, follow-up actions.']"

Boekaerts""]","In an attempt to help both students and teachers to change their traditional roles in the classroom, educational psychologists have engaged in two types of projects. The first project can be condensed to Òunderstanding the dynamics of self-regulated learningÓ. The second project can be summarized as Òunderstanding the dynamics of powerful learning environments as a way to promote self-regulation in the classroomÓ. In this essay I attempt to establish the centrality of self-regulation as a theoretical assumption and a fundamental psychological construct. I argue that most current psychological models of self-regulation, and by implication the innovation programs that are based on these models, are not well focused, are incomplete, and harbor many misconceptions. I also argue that educational psychologists need to broaden the way they conceptualize the dynamics of learning contexts and find new ways to study the integrated processes that make up self-regulation in the context of the classroom. My main message is that students bring their own goals to the classroom and that these goals are the key to their adaptation system. These personal goals give meaning and organization, or in other words purpose, to a studentÕs adaptation processes in the classroom. Some of my comments are critical, but I do not intend to discredit the important work that has been done in this area. Rather, I want to argue that educational psychologists need to broaden the way they conceptualize the dynamics of learning contexts and find new ways to study the integrated processes that make up self-regulation in the context of the classroom. Doing so requires not only using a kaleidoscope of teaching methods, but also looking beyond these methods to explore the possibilities of theories that remain marginalized in educational research.","For example, models predicting academic performance that include factors of motivation (e.g., self-efficacy, goal setting) with cognitive ability yield a lower error variance than models of cognitive ability alone, particularly at tertiary level (reviewed in #AUTHOR_TAG, 2001;Robbins et al., 2004).","['Learning is a latent variable, typically measured as academic performance in assessment work and examinations (Mislevy, Behrens, & Dicerbo, 2012).', 'Factors affecting academic performance have been the focus of research for many years (Farsides & Woodfield, 2003;Lent, Brown, & Hacket, 1994;Moran & Crowley, 1979).', 'It remains an active research topic (Buckingham Shum & Deakin Crick, 2012;Cassidy, 2011;Komarraju, Ramsey & Rinella, 2013), indicating the inherent difficulty in both measurement of learning (Knight, Buckinham Shum, & Littleton, 2013;Tempelaar et al., 2013), and modelling the learning process, particularly in tertiary education (Pardos et al., 2011).', 'Cognitive ability remains an important determinant of academic performance (Cassidy, 2011), often measured as prior academic ability.', 'Demographic data, such as age and gender, have been cited as significant (Naderi et al., 2009), as are data gathered from learner activity on online learning systems (Bayer et al., 2012;L�_pez et al., 2012).', 'In addition to the data systematically gathered by providers, other factors can be measured prior to commencing tertiary education, which could be useful in modelling learner academic performance.', 'For example, models predicting academic performance that include factors of motivation (e.g., self-efficacy, goal setting) with cognitive ability yield a lower error variance than models of cognitive ability alone, particularly at tertiary level (reviewed in #AUTHOR_TAG, 2001;Robbins et al., 2004).', 'Research into personality traits, specifically the BIG 5 factors of openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, and their impact on academic achievement in tertiary education, suggests some personality factors are indicative of potential academic achievement (Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2004De Feyter et al., 2012).', 'For example conscientiousness, which is associated with persistence and self-discipline (Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2004), is correlated with academic performance, but not with IQ, suggesting conscientiousness may compensate for lower ability (Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2008).', 'Openness, which is associated with curiosity, can be indicative of a deep learning style (Swanberg & Martinsen, 2010).', 'Learning style (deep or shallow) and selfregulated learning strategies are also relevant, and have been shown to mediate between other factors (such as factors of personality and factors of motivation) and academic performance (Biggs et al., 2001;Entwhistle, 2005;Swanberg & Martinsen, 2010).', 'This paper reviews a range of psychometric factors that could be used to predict academic performance in tertiary education (section 2).', 'It lays emphasis on factors that can be measured prior to, or during learner enrolment in tertiary education programmes.', 'The unique focus is to facilitate, and inform, early engagement with students potentially at risk of failing (e.g., Arnold & Pistilli, 2012;Laur�_a et al., 2013).', 'Furthermore, results from learner profiling during student induction can provide useful feedback to the learner on preferred approaches to learning tasks, and development of a personalized learning environment.', 'A review of pertinent data analysis techniques is presented in section 3, with an emphasis on empirical modelling approaches prevalent in educational data mining.', 'Section 4 outlines the benefits of greater collaboration between educational psychology and learning analytics.']",0,"['Learning is a latent variable, typically measured as academic performance in assessment work and examinations (Mislevy, Behrens, & Dicerbo, 2012).', 'Factors affecting academic performance have been the focus of research for many years (Farsides & Woodfield, 2003;Lent, Brown, & Hacket, 1994;Moran & Crowley, 1979).', 'It remains an active research topic (Buckingham Shum & Deakin Crick, 2012;Cassidy, 2011;Komarraju, Ramsey & Rinella, 2013), indicating the inherent difficulty in both measurement of learning (Knight, Buckinham Shum, & Littleton, 2013;Tempelaar et al., 2013), and modelling the learning process, particularly in tertiary education (Pardos et al., 2011).', 'For example, models predicting academic performance that include factors of motivation (e.g., self-efficacy, goal setting) with cognitive ability yield a lower error variance than models of cognitive ability alone, particularly at tertiary level (reviewed in #AUTHOR_TAG, 2001;Robbins et al., 2004).']"

CC1312,93144659,A Review of Psychometric Data Analysis and Applications,Geraldine Gray,Statistical and machine learning models to predict programming performance,"[""S Bergin""]","This thesis details a longitudinal study on factors that influence introductory  programming success and on the development of machine learning  models to predict incoming student performance. Although numerous  studies have developed models to predict programming success, the models  struggled to achieve high accuracy in predicting the likely performance of  incoming students. Our approach overcomes this by providing a machine  learning technique, using a set of three significant factors, that can predict  whether students will be 'weak' or 'strong' programmers with approximately  80% accuracy after only three weeks of programming experience.  This thesis makes three fundamental contributions. The first contribution  is a longitudinal study identifying factors that influence introductory  programming success, investigating 25 factors at four different institutions.  Evidence of the importance of mathematics, comfort-level and computer  game-playing as predictors of programming performance is provided. A  number of new instruments were developed by the author and a programming  self-esteem measure was shown to out-perform other previous comparable  comfort-level measures in predicting programming performance.  The second contribution of the thesis is an analysis of the use of machine  learning (ML) algorithms to predict performance and is a first attempt to  investigate the effectiveness of a variety of ML algorithms to predict introductory  programming performance. The ML models built as part of this  research are the most effective models so far developed. The models are  effective even when students have just commenced a programming module.  Consequently, timely interventions can be put in place to prevent struggling  students from failing.  The third contribution of the thesis is the recommendation of an algorithm,  based on detailed statistical analysis that should be used by the  computer science education community to predict the likely performance of  incoming students. Optimisations were carried out to investigate if prediction  accuracy could be further increased and an ensemble algorithm, StackingC,  was shown to improve prediction performance.  The factors identified in this thesis and the associated machine learning  models provide a means to predict accurately programming performance  when students have only completed preliminary programming concepts.

H. Rietveld"", ""G. Caroline M. Van Baal"", ""Dorret I. Boomsma""]","In order to determine high school entrance level in the Netherlands, nowadays, much value is attached to the results of a national test of educational achievement (CITO), administered around age 12. Surprisingly, up until now, no attention has been paid to the etiology of individual differences in the results of this national test of educational achievement. No attempt has been made to address the question about the nature of a possible association between the results of the CITO and cognitive abilities, as measured by psychometric IQ. The aim of this study is to explore to what extent psychometric IQ and scholastic achievement, as assessed by the CITO high school entrance test, are correlated. In addition, it was investigated whether this expected correlation was due to a common genetic background, shared or nonshared environmental influences common to CITO and intelligence or a combination of these influences. To this end multivariate behavior genetic analyses with CITO and IQ at ages 5, 7, 10 and 12 years have been conducted. The correlations were.41,.50,.60, and.63 between CITO and IQ assessed at age 5, 7, 10, and 12 respectively. The results of the analyses pointed to genetic effects as the main source of variance in CITO and an important source of covariance between CITO and IQ. Additive genetic effects accounted for 60% of the individual differences found in CITO scores in a large sample of Dutch 12-year-olds. This high heritability indicated that the CITO might be a valuable instrument to assess individual differences in cognitive abilities in children but might not be the right instrument to put the effect of education to the test.","It is notable that correlations between general intelligence and academic performance are stronger at secondary school level than in tertiary level education (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2002;Cassidy, 2011;Colom & Flores-Mendoza, 2007;Eysenck, 1994;Matarazzo & Goldstein, 1972).","['based on what is being measured.', 'Sternberg (1999) asserts that intelligence tests measure a developing expertise rather than a stable attribute, and the typically high correlation between intelligence scores and academic performance is because they measure the same skill set rather than developing a causal relationship.', 'In an analysis of a range of IQ studies measuring trends across two generations, Flynn (1987) identified a significant rise in IQ from one generation to the next.', 'Since the observation (Flynn effect) is unlikely to be due to genetic changes in such a short period, it would appear to be the result of acquired skills that improve performance in IQ tests by subjects with the same IQ as the parent generation.', 'This view is supported by other studies that compare children in Western and non-Western standards of education.', 'These have shown that children tended to score well on tests that measured skills valued by their parents (Sternberg (1999 p. 8).', 'It is notable that correlations between general intelligence and academic performance are stronger at secondary school level than in tertiary level education (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2002;Cassidy, 2011;Colom & Flores-Mendoza, 2007;Eysenck, 1994;Matarazzo & Goldstein, 1972).', 'Therefore, prior academic performance, such as High School Grade Point Average (HSGPA), 1 and/or standardized tests, such as American College Testing (ACT) 2 scores or Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) 3 scores, are frequently used as measures of ability when modelling academic performance in tertiary education.']",0,"['It is notable that correlations between general intelligence and academic performance are stronger at secondary school level than in tertiary level education (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2002;Cassidy, 2011;Colom & Flores-Mendoza, 2007;Eysenck, 1994;Matarazzo & Goldstein, 1972).']"

It integrates the features of associative classification in predictive rule analysis. In comparison of FOIL, PRM algorithm usually generates more rules.

However, training ANNs on large scale datasets are both data-intensive and computation-intensive. Therefore, large scale ANNs are used with reservation for their time-consuming training to get high precision. In this paper, we present cNeural, a customized parallel computing platform to accelerate training large scale neural networks with the backpropagation algorithm. Unlike many existing parallel neural network training systems working on thousands of training samples, cNeural is designed for fast training large scale datasets with millions of training samples. To achieve this goal, firstly, cNeural adopts HBase for large scale training dataset storage and parallel loading. Secondly, it provides a parallel in-memory computing framework for fast iterative training. Third, we choose a compact, event-driven messaging communication model instead of the heartbeat polling model for instant messaging delivery. Experimental results show that the overhead time cost by data loading and messaging communication is very low in cNeural and cNeural is around 50 times faster than the solution based on Hadoop MapReduce.

To investigate this situation, we distributed a stakeholder survey in September 2011 to an international audience from different sectors of education. The findings provide some further insights into the current level of understanding and expectations toward learning analytics among stakeholders. The survey was scaffolded by a conceptual framework on learning analytics that was developed based on a recent literature review. It divides the domain of learning analytics into six critical dimensions. The preliminary survey among 156 educational practitioners and researchers mostly from the higher education sector reveals substantial uncertainties in learning analytics.  In this article, we first briefly introduce the learning analytics framework and its six domains that formed the backbone structure to our survey. Afterwards, we describe the method and key results of the learning analytics questionnaire and draw further conclusions for the field in research and practice.

Dixon"", ""Richard G. Brereton""]","Five methods for discrimination are described, namely Euclidean Distance to centroids (EDC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (based on the Mahalanobis distance and pooled variance covariance matrix), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) (based on the Mahalanobis distance and individual class variance covariance matrix Ñ non-Bayesian form), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (using soft boundaries and Radial Basis Functions), and illustrated graphically as boundary methods. The performance of each method was determined using four synthetic datasets each consisting of 200 samples half belonging to one of two classes, and a further two synthetic datasets containing 400 samples, again equally split between the two classes. In datasets 1 to 3, five variables were distributed multinormally, in dataset 1 the classes are distributed roughly circularly but with a significant degree of overlap, in dataset 2, the distribution is in elongated hyperellipsoids with small overlap, and in dataset 3 there is a region of complete overlap between classes. In dataset 4 two variables are distributed in a crescent shape. In datasets 5 and 6, 100 variables were generated from multinormal populations, some of which were potential discriminators, however a large proportion of the variables were designed to be uninformative. The methods were optimised using a training set and their performance evaluated using a test set: this was repeated 100 times for different test and training set splits. The average % correctly classified was computed for each class and model, as well as the model stability for each sample (the proportion of times the sample is classified into the same group over all 100 iterations). The conclusions are that the performance of the classifiers depends very much on the distribution of data. Approaches such as LVQ and SVMs that try to determine complex boundaries perform best when the data is not normally distributed such as in dataset 4, but can be prone to overfitting otherwise. QDA tends to perform best on multinormal data although it can be influenced by non-discriminative variables which show a difference in variance. It is recommended to look at the data structure prior to model building to determine the optimal type of model.","While SVMs are limited to numeric attributes and binary classification tasks, #AUTHOR_TAG and Brereton (2009) found SVMs outperformed other learners when modelling datasets that are not normally distributed.","['A Support Vector Machine (SVM) models class membership by approximating a hyperplane that defines a linear boundary between two classes (Cortes & Vapnik, 1995).', 'In cases where the class boundary is non-linear, a kernel function can transpose the dataset to a higher number of dimensions, which may provide a linear class boundary (Nisbet et al., 2009, p. 13).', 'Training an SVM is a convex optimization problem to which a globally optimal solution can be found (Tan et al., 2006).', 'While SVMs are limited to numeric attributes and binary classification tasks, #AUTHOR_TAG and Brereton (2009) found SVMs outperformed other learners when modelling datasets that are not normally distributed.']",0,"['A Support Vector Machine (SVM) models class membership by approximating a hyperplane that defines a linear boundary between two classes (Cortes & Vapnik, 1995).', 'In cases where the class boundary is non-linear, a kernel function can transpose the dataset to a higher number of dimensions, which may provide a linear class boundary (Nisbet et al., 2009, p. 13).', 'While SVMs are limited to numeric attributes and binary classification tasks, #AUTHOR_TAG and Brereton (2009) found SVMs outperformed other learners when modelling datasets that are not normally distributed.']"

Nevertheless, it is argued that the theories have ground states with anti-de Sitter background geometry which are stable against fluctuations which vanish sufficiently fast at spatial infinity. Stability is implied because the appropriate conserved energy functional is positive for such fluctuations. Anti-de Sitter space is not globally hyperbolic, but the boundary conditions required for positive energy are also shown to give free field theories with well-defined Cauchy problem. New information on the particle representations of OSp(1, 4) supersymmetry is presented as part of the argument. Supersymmetry requires boundary conditions for spin 0 fields such that only the improved stress tensor leads to a conserved energy functional. Although the stability arguments support the view that gauged supergravity theories are acceptable quantum field theories, the problem of a large cosmological term in the Ads phase of the theories is still unsolved.","The objective here is to go beyond the extension of the model already discussed in #AUTHOR_TAG and to include a wider range of values of m 2 , satisfying the Brietenlohner-Freedman (BF) stability bound [29] and the unitarity bound.","['The objective here is to go beyond the extension of the model already discussed in #AUTHOR_TAG and to include a wider range of values of m 2 , satisfying the Brietenlohner-Freedman (BF) stability bound [29] and the unitarity bound.', 'We find it most convenient to choose values of m 2 in the interval of 0.5 units.', 'We shall focus our attention primarily on scalar fields with fall-offs at the AdS boundary, which are normalizable.', 'Based on this behavior at the boundary, the scalar field �� naturally split into two pieces, �� �_ __� and �� �_ + , with slower and faster fall-offs respectively.', 'These describes different condensates with distinct superconducting phases and different scaling dimensions.', 'We shall calculate each physical quantity associated with the condensates at a fixed temperature and for each value of m 2 , which will allow us to ascertain the dependence of this physical quantity on the scaling dimension.']",4,"['The objective here is to go beyond the extension of the model already discussed in #AUTHOR_TAG and to include a wider range of values of m 2 , satisfying the Brietenlohner-Freedman (BF) stability bound [29] and the unitarity bound.']"

Hertz""]","Quantum phase transitions occur at zero temperature and involve the appearance of long-range correlations. These correlations are not due to thermal fluctuations but to the intricate structure of a strongly entangled ground state of the system. We present a microscopic computation of the scaling properties of the ground-state entanglement in several 1D spin chain models both near and at the quantum critical regimes. We quantify entanglement by using the entropy of the ground state when the system is traced down to $L$ spins. This entropy is seen to scale logarithmically with $L$, with a coefficient that corresponds to the central charge associated to the conformal theory that describes the universal properties of the quantum phase transition. Thus we show that entanglement, a key concept of quantum information science, obeys universal scaling laws as dictated by the representations of the conformal group and its classification motivated by string theory. This connection unveils a monotonicity law for ground-state entanglement along the renormalization group flow. We also identify a majorization rule possibly associated to conformal invariance and apply the present results to interpret the breakdown of density matrix renormalization group techniques near a critical point.Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure","It is understood [10,#AUTHOR_TAG] that a quantum field theoretic description of condensed matter systems is possible in the vicinity of the quantum critical point (QCP), where the relevant scale invariant theories are similar to field theories describing second-order phase transitions, for example Ginzburg-Landau theory.","['This technique has been employed recently, to shed some light on strongly coupled systems that undergo superconducting instabilities at a critical temperature (see [8,9] for a review).', 'It is understood [10,#AUTHOR_TAG] that a quantum field theoretic description of condensed matter systems is possible in the vicinity of the quantum critical point (QCP), where the relevant scale invariant theories are similar to field theories describing second-order phase transitions, for example Ginzburg-Landau theory.', 'As the QCP is approached, systems 1 with the dynamical critical exponent z = 1 become invariant under re-scalings of time and distance.', 'This scale invariant symmetry forms part of the larger conformal symmetry group SO(d + 1, 2) [12,9] of the quantum field theory, where d is the number of spatial dimensions.', 'The emergence of this symmetry near the QCP implies that its dual gravitational description must reside in anti-de Sitter spacetime with an additional spatial dimension [8,13].']",4,"['It is understood [10,#AUTHOR_TAG] that a quantum field theoretic description of condensed matter systems is possible in the vicinity of the quantum critical point (QCP), where the relevant scale invariant theories are similar to field theories describing second-order phase transitions, for example Ginzburg-Landau theory.']"

These transitions, which are accessed at zero temperature by variation of a non-thermal control parameter, can influence the behavior of electronic systems over a wide range of the phase diagram. Quantum phase transitions occur as a result of competing ground state phases. The cuprate superconductors which can be tuned from a Mott insulating to a d-wave superconducting phase by carrier doping are a paradigmatic example. This review introduces important concepts of phase transitions and discusses the interplay of quantum and classical fluctuations near criticality. The main part of the article is devoted to bulk quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems. Several classes of transitions will be briefly reviewed, pointing out, e.g., conceptual differences between ordering transitions in metallic and insulating systems. An interesting separate class of transitions are boundary phase transitions where only degrees of freedom of a subsystem become critical; this will be illustrated in a few examples. The article is aimed on bridging the gap between high-level theoretical presentations and research papers specialized in certain classes of materials. It will give an overview over a variety of different quantum transitions, critically discuss open theoretical questions, and frequently make contact with recent experiments in condensed matter physics.Comment: 50 pages, 7 figs; (v2) final version as publishe","It is understood [#AUTHOR_TAG,11] that a quantum field theoretic description of condensed matter systems is possible in the vicinity of the quantum critical point (QCP), where the relevant scale invariant theories are similar to field theories describing second-order phase transitions, for example Ginzburg-Landau theory.","['This technique has been employed recently, to shed some light on strongly coupled systems that undergo superconducting instabilities at a critical temperature (see [8,9] for a review).', 'It is understood [#AUTHOR_TAG,11] that a quantum field theoretic description of condensed matter systems is possible in the vicinity of the quantum critical point (QCP), where the relevant scale invariant theories are similar to field theories describing second-order phase transitions, for example Ginzburg-Landau theory.', 'As the QCP is approached, systems 1 with the dynamical critical exponent z = 1 become invariant under re-scalings of time and distance.', 'This scale invariant symmetry forms part of the larger conformal symmetry group SO(d + 1, 2) [12,9] of the quantum field theory, where d is the number of spatial dimensions.', 'The emergence of this symmetry near the QCP implies that its dual gravitational description must reside in anti-de Sitter spacetime with an additional spatial dimension [8,13].']",4,"['It is understood [#AUTHOR_TAG,11] that a quantum field theoretic description of condensed matter systems is possible in the vicinity of the quantum critical point (QCP), where the relevant scale invariant theories are similar to field theories describing second-order phase transitions, for example Ginzburg-Landau theory.']"

Typical refactorings, such as function extraction and generalisation, are intended to make a program more amenable to extension, more comprehensible and so on. Refactorings differ from other sorts of program transformation in being applied to source code, rather than to a 'core' language within a compiler, and also in having an effect across a code base, rather than to a single function definition, say. Because of this, there is a need to give automated support to the process. This paper reflects on our experience of building tools to refactor functional programs written in Haskell (HaRe) and Erlang (Wrangler). We begin by discussing what refactoring means for functional programming languages, first in theory, and then in the context of a larger example. Next, we address system design and details of system implementation as well as contrasting the style of refactoring and tooling for Haskell and Erlang. Building both tools led to reflections about what particular refactorings mean, as well as requiring analyses of various kinds, and we discuss both of these. We also discuss various extensions to the core tools, including integrating the tools with test frameworks; facilities for detecting and eliminating code clones; and facilities to make the systems extensible by users.

This is especially true for distributed systems communicating via message-passing. In order to cope with this increased complexity, programmers need effective computer-supported methods for decomposition and dependence analysis of programs, to understand dependencies between different parts of software systems and to find the sources of errors. Program slicing is one method for such decomposition and dependence analysis. A program slice with respect to a specified variable at some program point consists of those parts of the program which may directly or indirectly affect the value of that variable at the particular program point.

The research program on the nature of social rationality presented here can be summarized by the following theses: As perceived by the human mind, the social world (Umwelt) is complex, but not necessarily more complex than the nonsocial world. However complex the social world may be, its complexity does not require cognitive complexity; rather, it entails conditions that make simple heuristics indispensible, such as intractability, multiple competing goals, and incommensurable reasons. Much of reasoning and decision making occurring in human and animal social environments can be modeled in terms of simple heuristics. Although simple heuristics forgo extensive information search and complex calculations, they can be as accurate and even more accurate than more complex strategies and/or can be used to reach other goals that are valued in social environments (e.g., transparency, fairness, speed). Heuristics can be simultaneously successful and simple by coopting evolved capacities. The capacities themselves can represent complex adaptive specializations (e.g., memory, movement tracking). Simple heuristics per se are neither rational nor irrational. Their rationality is ecological. That is, their performance depends on the match between the architecture of the heuristic and the structure of the environment in which it is used. The heuristics' simplicity inoculates them against overfitting and enables them to achieve robust performance given small samples of information. Simple heuristics can model adaptive decision making both in games against nature and in social games. There is no social intelligence distinct from nonsocial intelligence. Simple heuristics are tools of moderate generalizability. Some can be used only in games against nature, whereas others are restricted to social games. Still other heuristics can be applied in both types of games. Shedding light on the adaptive toolbox of simple heuristics used to navigate social environments, and characterizing their strengths and weaknesses, can help us design environments and/or heuristics in ways that improve public welfare. ","A growing number of researchers in these fields argues that humans in their common sense reasoning do not apply any full-fledged form of logical or probabilistic (and thus intractable) reasoning to possibly highly complex problems, but rather rely on mechanisms that reduce the latter to equivalent, simpler ones (see, e.g.,  #AUTHOR_TAG).","['And also on the more theoretical side, the described equivalence might form a connecting point to recent, much-noticed developments in cognitive science and cognitive psychology.', 'A growing number of researchers in these fields argues that humans in their common sense reasoning do not apply any full-fledged form of logical or probabilistic (and thus intractable) reasoning to possibly highly complex problems, but rather rely on mechanisms that reduce the latter to equivalent, simpler ones (see, e.g.,  #AUTHOR_TAG).', 'But although the number of supporters of these and similar ideas is constantly growing, a commonly accepted formal account of how this reduction process might work (or even technically be characterized and reconstructed) thus far has not been given.', 'Recognizing this as a serious deficit, Theorem 1 and its interpretation can provide inspiration and first hints at hypothesizing a specialized cognitive structure capable of computing the reduced instance of a problem, which then might allow for an efficient solving procedure -with the overall hypothesis in turn possibly serving as foundation and starting point for the development of computational accounts and (in the long run) a computational recreation of heuristics in computational cognitive models of reasoning, problem-solving and AI.']",0,"['And also on the more theoretical side, the described equivalence might form a connecting point to recent, much-noticed developments in cognitive science and cognitive psychology.', 'A growing number of researchers in these fields argues that humans in their common sense reasoning do not apply any full-fledged form of logical or probabilistic (and thus intractable) reasoning to possibly highly complex problems, but rather rely on mechanisms that reduce the latter to equivalent, simpler ones (see, e.g.,  #AUTHOR_TAG).']"

The Future Energy Scenario Assessment (FESA) software model used for this study is unique in providing a holistic, high resolution, functional analysis, which incorporates variations in supply resulting from weather-dependent renewable energy generators. The outputs of this model, arising from any given user-definable scenario, are year round supply and demand profiles that can be used to assess the market size and operational regime of energy technologies. FESA was used in this case to assess what - if anything - might be the role for hydrogen in a low carbon economy future for the UK.    In this study, three UK energy supply pathways were considered, all of which reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, and substantially reduce reliance on oil and gas while maintaining a stable electricity grid and meeting the energy needs of a modern economy. All use more nuclear power and renewable energy of all kinds than today's system. The first of these scenarios relies on substantial amounts of 'clean coal' in combination with intermittent renewable energy sources by year the 2050. The second uses twice as much intermittent renewable energy as the first and virtually no coal. The third uses 2.5 times as much nuclear power as the first and virtually no coal.    All scenarios clearly indicate that the use of hydrogen in the transport sector is important in reducing distributed carbon emissions that cannot easily be mitigated by Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). In the first scenario, this hydrogen derives mainly from steam reformation of fossil fuels (principally coal), whereas in the second and third scenarios, hydrogen is made mainly by electrolysis using variable surpluses of low-carbon electricity. Hydrogen thereby fulfils a double facetted role of Demand Side Management (DSM) for the electricity grid and the provision of a 'clean' fuel, predominantly for the transport sector. When each of the scenarios was examined without the use of hydrogen as a transport fuel, substantially larger amounts of primary energy were required in the form of imported coal.     The FESA model also indicates that the challenge of grid balancing is not a valid reason for limiting the amount of intermittent renewable energy generated. Engineering limitations, economic viability, local environmental considerations and conflicting uses of land and sea may limit the amount of renewable energy available, but there is no practical limit to the conversion of this energy into whatever is required, be it electricity, heat, motive power or chemical feedstocks","Indeed, a number of studies with more explicit representation of temporal and spatial issues have suggested that there may be roles for hydrogen in balancing demand and supply in systems with significant intermittent renewables #AUTHOR_TAG.","['x Fossil fuel prices.', 'The availability and costs of fossil fuels -in particular oil and natural gas -are of critical importance.', 'High oil prices will tend to promote a shift towards the adoption of hydrogen vehicles.', 'An important uncertainty that has emerged in recent years is the discovery of large resources of shale gas.', 'If this resource proves to be extractable in a sustainable manner, it has the potential to significantly lower natural gas prices, with implications for hydrogen.', 'x Energy storage and intermittency.', 'An acknowledged weakness in many energy systems models is a lack of spatial and temporal resolution.', 'Given that the critical selling point of hydrogen as a zerocarbon storable energy vector, this lack of temporal resolution may be important.', 'Indeed, a number of studies with more explicit representation of temporal and spatial issues have suggested that there may be roles for hydrogen in balancing demand and supply in systems with significant intermittent renewables #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Using the ESME model, Haslett has suggested that there may be roles for hydrogen in inter-seasonal storage of renewable energy [29].', 'x Future of gas.', 'Many long-term scenarios of decarbonisation envisage a very significant diminution in consumption of natural gas in the residential and service sectors.', 'The political dynamics of energy transitions have been neglected in studies of transitions to low carbon energy systems [30,31], but it is clear that there will be losers.', 'In particular, the owners and operators of natural gas infrastructurewho in the UK are currently investing many billions in new pipes-are unlikely to be passive politically in the course of a reference decarbonisation future.', ""It is already clear that European, North American and Japanese gas companies are lobbying and investing in technologies to resist an 'allelectric' energy distribution future.""]",0,"['x Fossil fuel prices.', 'Indeed, a number of studies with more explicit representation of temporal and spatial issues have suggested that there may be roles for hydrogen in balancing demand and supply in systems with significant intermittent renewables #AUTHOR_TAG.']"

There are several economic studies and models describing the introduction of hydrogen-powered vehicles, but most of them focus on only one segment of the car market. Most studies analyse the impacts of FCVs on the automotive industry or the demand for FCVs separately, while others look at the required hydrogen infrastructure, but none of these analyses examines the car market as a whole. The analysis takes into account the actions of the whole market (consumers, automotive manufacturers, filling station owners and policymakers) and their interactions. According to the results of the System Dynamics model the combination of tax-free hydrogen fuel, subsidies on FCVs and sufficient hydrogen infrastructure supply will lead to quick market penetration of FCVs. The analysis clearly shows that the government is recommended to support the installation of a sufficient number of hydrogen filling pumps at the beginning of the market introduction (e.g. 500 filling stations). Due to the model results, approximately 4.8 billion Euros are needed to reach a successful market penetration of FCVs. Thereby about one-third of all passenger cars will be driven with hydrogen in 2040 and even two-third in 2050. Primarily subsidies and tax allowances for the vehicles are necessary to reduce the price of FCVs to the average level of modern diesel cars; otherwise consumers' acceptance of FCVs will be very low. A rapid introduction of FCVs based on these policies is necessary in order to limit the cumulative subsidies for the vehicles and the fuel-tax deficit","A review of these studies suggests some conclusions: x The scale of early infrastructure provision can be very important, with initial infrastructure availability proving very important in several studies [23,24,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['A review of these studies suggests some conclusions: x The scale of early infrastructure provision can be very important, with initial infrastructure availability proving very important in several studies [23,24,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'This suggests a strong role for government, since the private sector is unlikely to take on the full risk of initial infrastructure investment, since any first mover advantages are likely to be too small to compensate the risks of failure.', 'x If sufficient initial infrastructure is provided, and learning rates are sufficiently high, vehicle subsidies plus fuel tax exemptions can lead to a self-sustaining transition without the need for government to lead a massive infrastructure programme beyond the initial stages [25].', 'The literature also suggests that x Learning-by-doing (the process by which costs fall as a function of cumulative deployment) is critical.']",0,"['A review of these studies suggests some conclusions: x The scale of early infrastructure provision can be very important, with initial infrastructure availability proving very important in several studies [23,24,#AUTHOR_TAG].']"
CC1387,82002670,Possible Hydrogen Transitions in the UK: Critical Uncertainties and Possible Decision Points,Will Mcdowall,Electric vehicles: How much range is required for a dayâ€™s driving?,"[""Nathaniel S. Pearre"", ""Willett Kempton"", ""Randall L. Guensler"", ""Vetri V. Elango""]","One full year of high-resolution driving data from 484 instrumented gasoline vehicles in the US is used to analyze daily driving patterns, and from those infer the range requirements of electric vehicles (EVs). We conservatively assume that EV drivers would not change their current gasoline-fueled driving patterns and that they would charge only once daily, typically at home overnight. Next, the market is segmented into those drivers for whom a limited-range vehicle would meet every dayÕs range need, and those who could meet their daily range need only if they make adaptations on some days. Adaptations, for example, could mean they have to either recharge during the day, borrow a liquidfueled vehicle, or save some errands for the subsequent day. From this analysis, with the stated assumptions, we infer the potential market share for limited-range vehicles. For example, we find that 9% of the vehicles in the sample never exceeded 100 miles in one day, and 21% never exceeded 150 miles in one day. These drivers presumably could substitute a limited-range vehicle, like electric vehicles now on the market, for their current gasoline vehicle without any adaptation in their driving at all. For drivers who are willing to make adaptations on 2 days a year, the same 100 mile range EV would meet the needs of 17% of drivers, and if they are willing to adapt every other month (six times a year), it would work for 32% of drivers. Thus, it appears that even modest electric vehicles with todayÕs limited battery range, if marketed correctly to segments with appropriate driving behavior, comprise a large enough market for substantial vehicle sales. An additional analysis examines driving versus parking by time of day. On the average weekday at 5 pm, only 15% of the vehicles in the sample are on the road; at no time during the year are fewer than 75% of vehicles parked. Also, because the return trip home is widely spread in time, even if all cars plug in and begin charging immediately when they arrive home and park, the increased demand on the electric system is less problematic than prior analyses have suggested.","Many studies examine the distribution of trips [#AUTHOR_TAG,13]), and find that the majority of trips are well within the range of a limited-range BEV (e.g. less than 160 km).","['There is little existing evidence on the range that consumers consider to be acceptable in automotive markets, since it is only very recently that battery electric vehicles have been placed on the market in significant numbers.', 'Many studies examine the distribution of trips [#AUTHOR_TAG,13]), and find that the majority of trips are well within the range of a limited-range BEV (e.g. less than 160 km).', 'Pearre et al [12] conduct a more sophisticated analysis of US trip data for a sample of 484 gasoline vehicles, relying on usage patterns by individuals rather than aggregated trip data.', 'They found that 9% of these vehicles never travelled more than 160 km in a single day, implying that vehicles with this maximum range could capture a potential market of 9% of the total vehicle fleet.', 'However, this conclusion excludes the possibility that many motorists will demand vehicles with greater range than they would actually use on a day-to-day basis.']",0,"['There is little existing evidence on the range that consumers consider to be acceptable in automotive markets, since it is only very recently that battery electric vehicles have been placed on the market in significant numbers.', 'Many studies examine the distribution of trips [#AUTHOR_TAG,13]), and find that the majority of trips are well within the range of a limited-range BEV (e.g. less than 160 km).', 'Pearre et al [12] conduct a more sophisticated analysis of US trip data for a sample of 484 gasoline vehicles, relying on usage patterns by individuals rather than aggregated trip data.', 'They found that 9% of these vehicles never travelled more than 160 km in a single day, implying that vehicles with this maximum range could capture a potential market of 9% of the total vehicle fleet.', 'However, this conclusion excludes the possibility that many motorists will demand vehicles with greater range than they would actually use on a day-to-day basis.']"

Depending on the energy sources used to produce the hydrogen they may also reduce greenhouse gases in the long-term. Besides problems related to the necessary investments into hydrogen infrastructure, there is a general notion that current fuel cells costs are too high to be competitive with conventional engines, creating an insurmountable barrier to introduction. But given historical evidence from many other technologies it is highly likely that learning by doing (LBD) would lead to substantial cost reductions. In this study we implement potential cost reductions from LBD into an existing agent based model that captures the main dynamics of the introduction of the new technology together with hydrogen infrastructure build up. Assumptions about the learning rate turn out to have a critical impact on the projected diffusion of the FCVs. Moreover, LBD could imply a substantial first mover advantage. We also address the impact of learning spillovers between producers and find that a government might face a policy trade off between fostering diffusion by facilitating learning spillovers and protecting the relative advantage of a national technological leader.","Technological uncertainties have been studied using a wide range of tools, including energy system models [6,7], system dynamics and agent-based models [#AUTHOR_TAG,10], and a number of techno-economic studies [11], and are relatively well characterized.","['Technological uncertainties have been studied using a wide range of tools, including energy system models [6,7], system dynamics and agent-based models [#AUTHOR_TAG,10], and a number of techno-economic studies [11], and are relatively well characterized.', 'We therefore do not review these in detail here.']",0,"['Technological uncertainties have been studied using a wide range of tools, including energy system models [6,7], system dynamics and agent-based models [#AUTHOR_TAG,10], and a number of techno-economic studies [11], and are relatively well characterized.']"

While much lower prices seem to be attainable in the future due to learning curve cost reductions that increase rapidly with the scale of diffusion of the technology, there is a chicken and egg problem, even when some consumers may be willing to pay more for green technologies. Drawing on recent percolation models of diffusion by Solomon et al. [7], Frenken et al. [8] and Hohnisch et al. [9], we develop a network model of new technology diffusion that combines contagion among consumers with heterogeneity of agent characteristics. Agents adopt when the price falls below their random reservation price drawn from a lognormal distribution, but only when one of their neighbors has already adopted. Combining with a learning curve for the price as a function of the cumulative number of adopters, this may lead to delayed adoption for a certain range of initial conditions. Using agent-based simulations we explore when a limited subsidy policy can trigger diffusion that would otherwise not happen. The introduction of a subsidy policy seems to be highly effective for a given high initial price level only for learning economies in a certain range. Outside this range, the diffusion of a new technology either never takes off despite the subsidies, or the subsidies are unnecessary. Perhaps not coincidentally, this range seems to correspond to the values observed for many successful innovations.Innovation diffusion, learning economies, percolation, networks, heterogeneous agents, technology subsidies, environmental technologies","Technological uncertainties have been studied using a wide range of tools, including energy system models [6,7], system dynamics and agent-based models [9,#AUTHOR_TAG], and a number of techno-economic studies [11], and are relatively well characterized.","['Technological uncertainties have been studied using a wide range of tools, including energy system models [6,7], system dynamics and agent-based models [9,#AUTHOR_TAG], and a number of techno-economic studies [11], and are relatively well characterized.', 'We therefore do not review these in detail here.']",0,"['Technological uncertainties have been studied using a wide range of tools, including energy system models [6,7], system dynamics and agent-based models [9,#AUTHOR_TAG], and a number of techno-economic studies [11], and are relatively well characterized.', 'We therefore do not review these in detail here.']"

The results of the analysis show that a hydrogen FCV would not be cost competitive until 2050 without a more severe carbon tax than the government's planned 2400 JPY/t-C carbon tax. However, as the carbon tax rate increases, instead of conventional vehicles including the gasoline hybrid electric vehicle, hydrogen FCVs gain market penetration earlier and more. By assuming a more severe carbon tax rate, such as 10 000 JPY/t-C, the market share of hydrogen FCVs approaches the governmental goal. This suggests that cheaper vehicle cost and hydrogen cost than those targeted in the roadmap should be attained or subsidies to hydrogen FCV and hydrogen refueling station will be necessary for achieving the goal of earlier market penetration.","Evidence from energy systems analysis suggests that the desirability of hydrogen as a decarbonisation option depends strongly on success in bringing down costs, for both fuel cell technologies and hydrogen production, delivery and storage systems [5,#AUTHOR_TAG,7].","['Hydrogen energy systems currently come at a considerably higher cost than incumbent energy systems, even when one takes into account the social costs associated with emissions.', 'Evidence from energy systems analysis suggests that the desirability of hydrogen as a decarbonisation option depends strongly on success in bringing down costs, for both fuel cell technologies and hydrogen production, delivery and storage systems [5,#AUTHOR_TAG,7].', 'Clearly, it is not only uncertainties for hydrogen technologies that are relevant here: successful developments within competing low carbon technologies (such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) may reduce the apparent desirability (or necessity) of deploying hydrogen systems.']",2,"['Evidence from energy systems analysis suggests that the desirability of hydrogen as a decarbonisation option depends strongly on success in bringing down costs, for both fuel cell technologies and hydrogen production, delivery and storage systems [5,#AUTHOR_TAG,7].', 'Clearly, it is not only uncertainties for hydrogen technologies that are relevant here: successful developments within competing low carbon technologies (such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) may reduce the apparent desirability (or necessity) of deploying hydrogen systems.']"

Yet, there are a number of barriers that need to be overcome if hydrogen vehicles are ever to penetrate transportation markets, not the least of which is the development of a vehicle-infrastructure system. Hydrogen vehicles and refueling infrastructure are complementary goods and must both successfully penetrate transportation markets for either to be successful. This paper describes a system dynamics model created to investigate the vehicle-infrastructure phenomenon currently inhibiting the growth of hydrogen transportation systems. Four scenarios explore the phenomenon through analysis of vehicle adoption, infrastructure development rates, and hydrogen market conditions. We conclude that a coordinated policy approach that simultaneously encourages both the purchase of hydrogen vehicles and the building of hydrogen infrastructure is the most effective approach for rapid vehicle-infrastructure adoption.","A review of these studies suggests some conclusions: x The scale of early infrastructure provision can be very important, with initial infrastructure availability proving very important in several studies [23,#AUTHOR_TAG,25].","['A review of these studies suggests some conclusions: x The scale of early infrastructure provision can be very important, with initial infrastructure availability proving very important in several studies [23,#AUTHOR_TAG,25].', 'This suggests a strong role for government, since the private sector is unlikely to take on the full risk of initial infrastructure investment, since any first mover advantages are likely to be too small to compensate the risks of failure.', 'x If sufficient initial infrastructure is provided, and learning rates are sufficiently high, vehicle subsidies plus fuel tax exemptions can lead to a self-sustaining transition without the need for government to lead a massive infrastructure programme beyond the initial stages [25].', 'The literature also suggests that x Learning-by-doing (the process by which costs fall as a function of cumulative deployment) is critical.']",0,"['A review of these studies suggests some conclusions: x The scale of early infrastructure provision can be very important, with initial infrastructure availability proving very important in several studies [23,#AUTHOR_TAG,25].', 'This suggests a strong role for government, since the private sector is unlikely to take on the full risk of initial infrastructure investment, since any first mover advantages are likely to be too small to compensate the risks of failure.', 'x If sufficient initial infrastructure is provided, and learning rates are sufficiently high, vehicle subsidies plus fuel tax exemptions can lead to a self-sustaining transition without the need for government to lead a massive infrastructure programme beyond the initial stages [25].', 'The literature also suggests that x Learning-by-doing (the process by which costs fall as a function of cumulative deployment) is critical.']"

A decisive reason for this is the dependence of most European countries from gas imports. Except for Italy, there is no tradition to use natural gas as fuel. In addition, there is a lack of infrastructure (e.g. fuelling stations). In contrast to Europe, in Latin American and Asian countries natural gas vehicles are widespread. Some countries foster natural gas vehicles because they have own gas resources. Many countries must reduce the high air pollution in big cities. Environmental reasons are the main motive for the use of natural gas vehicles in Europe. In last years, high oil prices stimulated the use of natural gas as fuel. European governments have developed incentives (e.g. tax reductions) to foster natural gas vehicles. However, the focus is on hybrid technology and the electric car, which, however, need further technical improvement. In contrast, the use of natural gas in conventional engines is technically mature.

Hydrogen vehicles are predicted to have costs by 2030 that should give them a break-even distance of less than this critical level. It will be necessary to ensure that there are sufficient refuelling stations for hydrogen to be a convenient choice for drivers. While additional LPG stations have led to increases in vehicle numbers, and increases in vehicles have been followed by greater numbers of refuelling stations, these effects are too small to give self-sustaining growth.

Despite decades of effort, we still face daunting challenges to promote wider acceptance of AFVs by the general public. More empirical analyses are needed to understand the technology adoption process associated with different market structures, the effectiveness of regulations and incentives, and the density of infrastructure adequate to reach sustainable commercial application. This paper compares the adoption of natural gas vehicles (NGVs) in eight countries: Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Italy, New Zealand, Pakistan, and the US. It examines the major policies aimed at promoting the use of NGVs, instruments for implementing those policies and targeting likely stakeholders, and a range of factors that influence the adoption of NGVs.

Melaina""]","This paper examines the experience of existing alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) programs in the US and China to provide insights into appropriate strategies for developing hydrogen vehicles and infrastructure in China. Although an increasing number of AFVs have been deployed in recent years, various factors have limited this progress, such as large sunk investments in conventional technologies, limited networks of refueling stations, the typically higher cost of AFVs, and the relatively low price of oil. Given these barriers, and additional barriers specific to hydrogen, a transition to hydrogen will be a slow process, and must be supported by both near- and long-term policies that have clear and measurable goals that take hydrogen beyond fleet applications into broader vehicle markets. Because a transition to hydrogen vehicles will not occur quickly, it is necessary for the government to have consistent and integrated transportation policies combining short- and long-term goals. These policies should draw upon resources from both governments and multinational companies to provide incentives for vehicle purchases, promote investment in infrastructure, and disseminate information to raise public awareness. Multinationals may find China to be an ideal testing ground for innovative hydrogen vehicles with appropriate incentive policies and programs.","In the US, the major policy drivers for alternative fuels have largely come from federal governments, with limited success #AUTHOR_TAG.","['The literature highlights an important role for local governments, frequently neglected in national-level analyses of possible hydrogen transitions.', 'Yeh [18] shows that uptake of CNG and LPG has been significant in places with significant urban pollution problems, where local government regulatory decisions have been decisive.', 'Local governments can be important both because they often have strong regulatory powers with respect to local air quality and public health, and second, because they often have strong powers with respect to local public transport and taxi fleets.', 'National governments have played key roles in both successful and failed alternative vehicle and fuel programmes.', 'In the US, the major policy drivers for alternative fuels have largely come from federal governments, with limited success #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'National programmes have been successful elsewhere.', ""Argentina's national programme to promote CNG vehicles relied on price controls on fuel, and has been relatively successful despite almost no government involvement in infrastructure provision [20].""]",0,"['In the US, the major policy drivers for alternative fuels have largely come from federal governments, with limited success #AUTHOR_TAG.']"

An Italy-Markal model was used to analyse the national energy-environment up to 2050. About 40 specific hydrogen technologies were considered, reproducing the main chains of production, transport and consumption, with a focus on transport applications. The analysis is based on the Baseline and Alternative scenario results, where hydrogen reaches a significant share. The two scenarios constitute the starting points to analyse the hydrogen potential among the possible energy policy options. The energy demand in the Baseline scenario reaches values around 240 Mtoe at 2030, with an average annual growth of 0.9%. The Alternative scenario reduces consumption down to 220 Mtoe and stabilizes the CO 2 emissions. The Alternative scenario expects a rapid increase of hydrogen vehicles in 2030, up to 2.5 million, corresponding to 1 Mtoe of hydrogen consumption. A sensitivity analysis shows that the results are rather robust.","Evidence from energy systems analysis suggests that the desirability of hydrogen as a decarbonisation option depends strongly on success in bringing down costs, for both fuel cell technologies and hydrogen production, delivery and storage systems [#AUTHOR_TAG,6,7].","['Hydrogen energy systems currently come at a considerably higher cost than incumbent energy systems, even when one takes into account the social costs associated with emissions.', 'Evidence from energy systems analysis suggests that the desirability of hydrogen as a decarbonisation option depends strongly on success in bringing down costs, for both fuel cell technologies and hydrogen production, delivery and storage systems [#AUTHOR_TAG,6,7].', 'Clearly, it is not only uncertainties for hydrogen technologies that are relevant here: successful developments within competing low carbon technologies (such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) may reduce the apparent desirability (or necessity) of deploying hydrogen systems.']",2,"['Hydrogen energy systems currently come at a considerably higher cost than incumbent energy systems, even when one takes into account the social costs associated with emissions.', 'Evidence from energy systems analysis suggests that the desirability of hydrogen as a decarbonisation option depends strongly on success in bringing down costs, for both fuel cell technologies and hydrogen production, delivery and storage systems [#AUTHOR_TAG,6,7].']"

This article makes four contributions to the approach by addressing some open issues. The first contribution is to explicitly incorporate the user side in the analysis. Hence, the unit of analysis is widened from sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. The second contribution is to suggest an analytical distinction between systems, actors involved in them, and the institutions which guide actor's perceptions and activities. Thirdly, the article opens up the black box of institutions, making them an integral part of the analysis. Institutions should not just be used to explain inertia and stability. They can also be used to conceptualise the dynamic interplay between actors and structures. The fourth contribution is to address issues of change from one system to another. The article provides a coherent conceptual multi-level perspective, using insights from sociology, institutional theory and innovation studies. The perspective is particularly useful to analyse long-term dynamics, shifts from one socio-technical system to another and the co-evolution of technology and society.","In the interests of brevity, the framework is not elaborated here, and the interested reader is referred to Geels [3,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['Having identified a long list of uncertainties and possibilities for a hydrogen transition, we then structured these in terms of an established theoretical framework, the multi-level perspective on sociotechnical transitions.', ""This perspective recognises events occurring at three levels of analysis: the overall background context or 'landscape' level, in which systems change takes place; the socio-technical system or regime, made up of technologies along with the actors, institutions and networks that together represent the incumbent technological system; and niches, within which innovations are fostered and from which some emerge to replace the regime."", 'In the interests of brevity, the framework is not elaborated here, and the interested reader is referred to Geels [3,#AUTHOR_TAG].']",5,"['Having identified a long list of uncertainties and possibilities for a hydrogen transition, we then structured these in terms of an established theoretical framework, the multi-level perspective on sociotechnical transitions.', ""This perspective recognises events occurring at three levels of analysis: the overall background context or 'landscape' level, in which systems change takes place; the socio-technical system or regime, made up of technologies along with the actors, institutions and networks that together represent the incumbent technological system; and niches, within which innovations are fostered and from which some emerge to replace the regime."", 'In the interests of brevity, the framework is not elaborated here, and the interested reader is referred to Geels [3,#AUTHOR_TAG].']"

Previous studies of decarbonisation pathways using the UK MARKAL energy system model have concluded that the low-pressure gas networks should be mostly abandoned by 2050, yet most of the iron pipes near buildings are currently being replaced early for safety reasons. Our study suggests that this programme will not lock-in the use of gas in the long-term. We examine potential future uses of the gas network in the UK energy system using an improved version of UK MARKAL that introduces a number of decarbonisation options for the gas network including bio-methane, hydrogen injection to the natural gas and conversion of the network to deliver hydrogen. We conclude that hydrogen conversion is the only gas decarbonisation option that might enable the gas networks to continue supplying energy to most buildings in the long-term, from a cost-optimal perspective. There is an opportunity for the government to adopt a long-term strategy for the gas distribution networks that either curtails the iron mains replacement programme or alters it to prepare the network for hydrogen conversion; both options could substantially reduce the long-term cost of supplying heat to UK buildings.","We tested elements of this scenario by revising the models' representationofthegasnetwork, and introducing the option of injectinghydrogenintothegasgrid #AUTHOR_TAG.","[""We tested elements of this scenario by revising the models' representationofthegasnetwork, and introducing the option of injectinghydrogenintothegasgrid #AUTHOR_TAG."", 'The modelling suggested that this could be a cost effective option, which highlights this as an issue worthy of further research andattention.']",2,"[""We tested elements of this scenario by revising the models' representationofthegasnetwork, and introducing the option of injectinghydrogenintothegasgrid #AUTHOR_TAG.""]"

We therefore aimed to assess changes over calendar time in the risk for HIV-associated dementia (HIV-D), and factors associated with HIV-D risk.Using Concerted Action on Seroconversion to AIDS and Death in Europe (CASCADE) data, we analyzed factors associated with time from HIV seroconversion to HIV-D using Cox models with time-updated covariates. The effect of duration of infection was explored using flexible parametric survival models.222 of 15,380 seroconverters developed HIV-D. The incidence per 1,000 person-years was 6.49 pre-1997 (before highly active antiretroviral therapy was available), declining to 0.66 by 2003 to 2006.

As the intervention is often claimed to have important health, nutrition, and societal effects beyond the removal of worms, we critically evaluated the evidence on benefits.To summarize the effects of giving deworming drugs to children to treat soil-transmitted helminths on weight, haemoglobin, and cognition; and the evidence of impact on physical well-being, school attendance, school performance, and mortality.We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (14 April 2015); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library (2015, Issue 4); MEDLINE (2000 to 14 April 2015); EMBASE (2000 to 14 April 2015); LILACS (2000 to 14 April 2015); the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT); and reference lists, and registers of ongoing and completed trials up to 14 April 2015.We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing deworming drugs for soil-transmitted helminths with placebo or no treatment in children aged 16 years or less, reporting on weight, haemoglobin, and formal tests of intellectual development. We also sought data on school attendance, school performance, and mortality. We included trials that combined health education with deworming programmes.At least two review authors independently assessed the trials, evaluated risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed continuous data using the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where data were missing, we contacted trial authors. We used outcomes at time of longest follow-up. The evidence quality was assessed using GRADE. This edition of the Cochrane Review adds the DEVTA trial from India, and draws on an independent analytical replication of a trial from Kenya.We identified 45 trials, including nine cluster-RCTs, that met the inclusion criteria. One trial evaluating mortality included over one million children, and the remaining 44 trials included a total of 67,672 participants. Eight trials were in children known to be infected, and 37 trials were carried out in endemic areas, including areas of high (15 trials), moderate (12 trials), and low prevalence (10 trials). Treating children known to be infectedTreating children known to be infected with a single dose of deworming drugs (selected by screening, or living in areas where all children are infected) may increase weight gain over the next one to six months (627 participants, five trials, low quality evidence). The effect size varied across trials from an additional 0.2 kg gain to 1.3 kg. There is currently insufficient evidence to know whether treatment has additional effects on haemoglobin (247 participants, two trials, very low quality evidence); school attendance (0 trials); cognitive functioning (103 participants, two trials, very low quality evidence), or physical well-being (280 participants, three trials, very low quality evidence). Community deworming programmesTreating all children living in endemic areas with a dose of deworming drugs probably has little or no effect on average weight gain (MD 0.04 kg less, 95% CI 0.11 kg less to 0.04 kg more; trials 2719 participants, seven trials, moderate quality evidence), even in settings with high prevalence of infection (290 participants, two trials). A single dose also probably has no effect on average haemoglobin (MD 0.06 g/dL, 95% CI -0.05 lower to 0.17 higher; 1005 participants, three trials, moderate quality evidence), or average cognition (1361 participants, two trials, low quality evidence).Similiarly, regularly treating all children in endemic areas with deworming drugs, given every three to six months, may have little or no effect on average weight gain (MD 0.08 kg, 95% CI 0.11 kg less to 0.27 kg more; 38,392 participants, 10 trials, low quality evidence). The effects were variable across trials; one trial from a low prevalence setting carried out in 1995 found an increase in weight, but nine trials carried out since then found no effect, including five from moderate and high prevalence areas.There is also reasonable evidence that regular treatment probably has no effect on average height (MD 0.02 cm higher, 95% CI 0.14 lower to 0.17 cm higher; 7057 participants, seven trials, moderate quality evidence); average haemoglobin (MD 0.02 g/dL lower; 95% CI 0.08 g/dL lower to 0.04 g/dL higher; 3595 participants, seven trials, low quality evidence); formal tests of cognition (32,486 participants, five trials, moderate quality evidence); exam performance (32,659 participants, two trials, moderate quality evidence); or mortality (1,005,135 participants, three trials, low quality evidence). There is very limited evidence assessing an effect on school attendance and the findings are inconsistent, and at risk of bias (mean attendance 2% higher, 95% CI 4% lower to 8% higher; 20,243 participants, two trials, very low quality evidence).In a sensitivity analysis that only included trials with adequate allocation concealment, there was no evidence of any effect for the main outcomes.Treating children known to have worm infection may have some nutritional benefits for the individual. However, in mass treatment of all children in endemic areas, there is now substantial evidence that this does not improve average nutritional status, haemoglobin, cognition, school performance, or survival.","Not surprisingly, the CC review concludes that the intervention may improve weight gain only in children ""known to have worm infection"" #AUTHOR_TAG.","['Not surprisingly, the CC review concludes that the intervention may improve weight gain only in children ""known to have worm infection"" #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'A systematic review is hardly necessary to point out that children without worms do not directly benefit from the administration of a deworming tablet.']",1,"['Not surprisingly, the CC review concludes that the intervention may improve weight gain only in children ""known to have worm infection"" #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'A systematic review is hardly necessary to point out that children without worms do not directly benefit from the administration of a deworming tablet.']"

However, epidemiological data available are often limited to prevalence estimates.We reanalyzed available data from 19 surveys in 10 countries and parameterized the relationship between prevalence of STH infections and the proportion of moderate and heavy intensity infections.The equations derived allow feeding the WHO model with estimates of the proportion of the different classes of infection intensity when only prevalence data is available.The prediction capacities of the STH model using the equations developed in the present study, should be tested by comparing it with the changes on STH epidemiological data observed in control programs operating for several years.(c) The Author 2014.

The systems serve complementary functions and can simultaneously generate different solutions to a reasoning problem.

Yet, strong gender inequalities persist in the career chances of equally highly qualified men and women. Women are still underrepresented in executive/ leading positions in both the private and public sector of the economy. We argue that such gender inequalities are also due to the fact that the majority of highly educated women lives with an equally highly educated partner. For these women the realization of dual careers becomes ever more important and represents an essential prerequisite for their own professional development. Following Phyllis Moen's 'linked lives' idea, we will argue that the achievement or failure of dual-career arrangements is a 'social-relational process' (Moen 2003a: 10) and that partners' lives are embedded with and influenced by each other. In particular, we will discuss how this entwining occurs, which processes at different levels play a role, and how these different processes interact with each other. Finally, we will give some suggestions on the direction for future research. -- Vor allem bei Hochqualifizierten charakterisiert ein andauernder Aufwartstrend weiblicher Beschaftigungsraten die westlichen Industrielander in den letzten Jahrzehnten.

All these theories have in common the distinction between cognitive processes that are fast, automatic, and unconscious and those that are slow, deliberative, and conscious. A number of authors have recently suggested that there may be two architecturally (and evolutionarily) distinct cognitive systems underlying these dual-process accounts. However, it emerges that (a) there are multiple kinds of implicit processes described by different theorists and (b) not all of the proposed attributes of the two kinds of processing can be sensibly mapped on to two systems as currently conceived. It is suggested that while some dual-process theories are concerned with parallel competing processes involving explicit and implicit knowledge systems, others are concerned with the influence of preconscious processes that contextualize and shape deliberative reasoning and decision-making.","Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and others have attempted provide an account of these systematic errors by introducing and characterizing these cognitive strategies: ""heuristics and biases"" (Evans 1984(#AUTHOR_TAG , 1989Gilovich Griffin and Kahneman 2002, Kahneman et al 2002, Levinson 1995, Tversky 1974.","['In order to begin the discussion of the systematic and predictable errors in reasoning, I will introduce the study of statistical reasoning-e.g., probabilistic inference (Bar-Hillel 1973, Chapman and Chapman 1967, 1969, Edwards et al 1968, Epley et al 2004, Epley and Golivoch 2001, Evans 1977, Galbraith and Underwood 1973, Hogarth 1975, Mans 1970, Rips 1975, Savage 1971, Sta�_l von Holstein 1971.', 'Statistical reasoning tasks often required participants to describe something statistically or make an inference under conditions that impose uncertainty.', 'What these tasks reveal is that it is very common for both expert and novice reasoners to make errors in statistical reasoning tasks (for a helpful summary of this kind of research, see Tversky and Kahneman 1974).', ""Interestingly, patterns and similarities manifest in participants' errors, implying that these errors might have been systematic and perhaps symptomatic of a certain cognitive strategy."", 'Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and others have attempted provide an account of these systematic errors by introducing and characterizing these cognitive strategies: ""heuristics and biases"" (Evans 1984(#AUTHOR_TAG , 1989Gilovich Griffin and Kahneman 2002, Kahneman et al 2002, Levinson 1995, Tversky 1974.', 'Heuristics and biases reduce the complexity and higher-level computation required by certain tasks to simpler judgments (Tverksy and Kahneman 1974Kahneman , 1124.', ""In other words, Kahneman and Tversky claimed that participants recruited heuristics or biases when answering certain statistical questions-as opposed to performing complete calculations-and that the recruitment of these heuristics or biases accounted for the patterns and similarities in participants' errors-e.g., why participants' answers to various statistical questions were apparently insensitive to sample size (ibid., Kahneman andTversky 1973, Shortliffe andBuchanon 1975).""]",4,"['Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and others have attempted provide an account of these systematic errors by introducing and characterizing these cognitive strategies: ""heuristics and biases"" (Evans 1984(#AUTHOR_TAG , 1989Gilovich Griffin and Kahneman 2002, Kahneman et al 2002, Levinson 1995, Tversky 1974.', 'Heuristics and biases reduce the complexity and higher-level computation required by certain tasks to simpler judgments (Tverksy and Kahneman 1974Kahneman , 1124.']"
CC1425,54847651,Intuitive and Reflective Responses in Philosophy,Nick Byrd,How to Use Intuitions in Philosophy,"[""Brian Talbot""]","UnrestrictedIntuitions currently play a central evidential role in much of the practice of philosophy.  There are, however, a number of concerns raised about this role.  Some have claimed that intuitions are intuitions are in no way good evidence; others, that they are evidence about only a limited range of (mostly mental) phenomena.  I argue that these are empirical claims, and that the proper way to evaluate them is to come to an understanding of what intuitions are, how they are generated, and what factors affect them.  Further, I argue that this should be based on a systematic, empirically-founded theory of the general operation of our unconscious minds.  This means that an evaluation of philosophical methodology is intertwined with an understanding of psychology and cognitive science.  I present the outlines of such a theory based on a synthesis of a wide range of psychological research; in so doing I engage with several current debates in psychology and cognitive science about issues including the innateness of knowledge, mental modularity, unconscious intelligence, and the structure of our concepts.  Our intuitive faculties are, it turns out, a good source of data - better in many ways than our conscious minds - about certain domains of philosophy, but not all.  This means that philosophers generally, no matter their interests, should look to a psychologically informed understanding of the mind to see if intuitions will be good evidence in their research, and also to see the pitfalls and biases intuitions about their topic might succumb to.  To illustrate this process, I consider the application of intuitions to specific questions in epistemology and the metaphysics of causation","There is little question that philosophers make these kinds of appeals (Audi 2004, Kornblith 1998, #AUTHOR_TAG 2009, Chalmers 2013; for an opposing view, see Cappelen 2012).","[""But consider how difficult it can be to show that one's premises are true."", 'After all, not all premises are subject to empirical investigation and conceptual analysis might not conclusively arbitrate the truth-value of a premise.', 'Perhaps this is why philosophers will argue, explicitly or implicitly, that premises can be considered true or false in virtue of their intuitive appeal-viz., the premise just seems to be true or false (Audi 2004, Bealer 1998, Huemer 2005, Nagel 2007.', 'There is little question that philosophers make these kinds of appeals (Audi 2004, Kornblith 1998, #AUTHOR_TAG 2009, Chalmers 2013; for an opposing view, see Cappelen 2012).', 'So, it seems that in addition to logical competence, analytic philosophers must also demonstrate some kind of competence in exercising intuitionincluding, perhaps, the intuition of their interlocutors.']",4,"['There is little question that philosophers make these kinds of appeals (Audi 2004, Kornblith 1998, #AUTHOR_TAG 2009, Chalmers 2013; for an opposing view, see Cappelen 2012).', 'So, it seems that in addition to logical competence, analytic philosophers must also demonstrate some kind of competence in exercising intuitionincluding, perhaps, the intuition of their interlocutors.']"

The thread, if it doesn't break, is the theme of a systematic bias in human thinking, in the direction of interactive thinking (E. Goody'sÊanticipatory interactive planningÊor AIP). Because the argument is somewhat indirect, let me state the thesis right here in the beginning in semi-syllogistic form: Communication isÊlogicallyÊimpossible Nevertheless we humans can communicate Therefore, we must useÊnon-logicalÊheuristics and a special form of reasoning to bridge the gap For communication to work routinely, these heuristics must be dominant in our thinking all the time Therefore, these heuristics spill over to bias our thinking in non-communication domains.

Often they have looked for answers by considering what it is that philosophers do. Given the diversity of topics and methods found in philosophy, however, we propose a different approach. In this article we consider the philosophical temperament, asking an alternative question: What are philosophers like? Our answer is that one important aspect of the philosophical temperament is that philosophers are especially reflective: They are less likely than their peers to embrace what seems obvious without questioning it. This claim is supported by a study of more than 4,000 philosophers and non-philosophers, the results of which indicate that even when we control for overall education level, philosophers tend to be significantly more reflective than their peers. We then illustrate this tendency by considering what we know about the philosophizing of a few prominent philosophers. Recognizing this aspect of the philosophical temperament, it is natural to wonder how philosophers came to be this way: Does philosophical training teach reflectivity or do more reflective people tend to gravitate to philosophy?

We advance a new conceptual model of the 2 processing modes. The structural basis of the new model is the idea, supported by psychological and neuropsychological evidence, that humans possess 2 memory systems. One system slowly learns general regularities, whereas the other can quickly form representations of unique or novel events. Associative retrieval or pattern completion in the slow-learning system elicited by a salient cue constitutes the effortless processing mode. The second processing mode is more conscious and effortful; it involves the intentional retrieval of explicit, symbolically represented rulesfrom either memory system and their use to guide processing. After presenting our model, we review existing dual-process models in several areas, emphasizing their similar assumptions of a quick, effortless processing mode that rests on well-learned prior associations and a second, more effortful processing mode that involves rule-based inferences and is employed only when people have both cognitive capacity and motivation.

Evans (1983) demonstrated that use of explicit rather than implicit negative cases markedly reduced the matching bias effect on the conditional truth table task. In apparent contrast, recent studies of explicit negation on the Wason selection task have failed to find evidence of logical facilitation. Experiment 1 of the present study strongly replicated the Evans (1983) findings and extended them to three forms of conditional statement. Experiments 2 and 3 showed further that the use of explicit negatives removed completely the matching bias effect on the Wason selection task. However, consistent with other recent studies, this elimination of bias did not lead to facilitation of correct responding. The findings are interpreted as providing evidence that matching bias reflects a linguistically cued relevance effect.","In an effort to highlight reasoning that might be isomorphic to philosophical reasoning, I will turn to logical reasoninge.g., deductive and conditional reasoning-the study of which has revealed further systematic errors in reasoning (Barwise 1993, Bell and Johnson-Laird-1998, Bonatti 1994, Cummins 1991, Evans Clibbens and Rood 1996, #AUTHOR_TAG, Dugan and Revlin 1990, Hardman and Payne 1995, Johnson-Laird 1999, Johnson-Laird and Byrne 2002, Shynkaruk and Thompson 2006, Thompson 2010, Turner and Thompson 2009, Wetherick and Golhooly 1990.","['Since the time of these results about statistical reasoning and introspective access to reasoning, other forms of reason have also been studied, and with similar results.', 'In an effort to highlight reasoning that might be isomorphic to philosophical reasoning, I will turn to logical reasoninge.g., deductive and conditional reasoning-the study of which has revealed further systematic errors in reasoning (Barwise 1993, Bell and Johnson-Laird-1998, Bonatti 1994, Cummins 1991, Evans Clibbens and Rood 1996, #AUTHOR_TAG, Dugan and Revlin 1990, Hardman and Payne 1995, Johnson-Laird 1999, Johnson-Laird and Byrne 2002, Shynkaruk and Thompson 2006, Thompson 2010, Turner and Thompson 2009, Wetherick and Golhooly 1990.']",4,"['In an effort to highlight reasoning that might be isomorphic to philosophical reasoning, I will turn to logical reasoninge.g., deductive and conditional reasoning-the study of which has revealed further systematic errors in reasoning (Barwise 1993, Bell and Johnson-Laird-1998, Bonatti 1994, Cummins 1991, Evans Clibbens and Rood 1996, #AUTHOR_TAG, Dugan and Revlin 1990, Hardman and Payne 1995, Johnson-Laird 1999, Johnson-Laird and Byrne 2002, Shynkaruk and Thompson 2006, Thompson 2010, Turner and Thompson 2009, Wetherick and Golhooly 1990.']"

This gap between the normative and the descriptive can be interpreted as indicating systematic irrationalities in human cognition. However, four alternative interpretations preserve the assumption that human behavior and cognition is largely rational. These posit that the gap is due to (1) performance errors, (2) computational limitations, (3) the wrong norm being applied by the experimenter, and (4) a different construal of the task by the subject. In the debates about the viability of these alternative explanations, attention has been focused too narrowly on the model response. In a series of experiments involving most of the classic tasks in the heuristics and biases literature, we have examined the implications of individual differences in performance for each of the four explanations of the normative/descriptive gap. Performance errors are a minor factor in the gap; computational limitations underlie non-normative responding on several tasks, particularly those that involve some type of cognitive decontextualization. Unexpected patterns of covariance can suggest when the wrong norm is being applied to a task or when an alternative construal of the task should be considered appropriate.","This might be unsurprising given that reasoners with higher levels of analytic intelligence-perhaps those who have enjoyed philosophical training and selection-will tend to respond reflectively on various reasoning tasks (McCelroy andSeta 2003, #AUTHOR_TAG andWest 2000).","['In Section 3, I mentioned that philosophy majors outperform most other majors on the LSAT and the GRE.', 'In Section 4, I mentioned that philosophical training is positively correlated with performance on the CRT (Livengood et al 2010).', 'This might be unsurprising given that reasoners with higher levels of analytic intelligence-perhaps those who have enjoyed philosophical training and selection-will tend to respond reflectively on various reasoning tasks (McCelroy andSeta 2003, #AUTHOR_TAG andWest 2000).', 'Naturally, then we should expect that having or being a candidate for a PhD in philosophy will positively correlate with answering reflectively on the CRT.']",4,"['This might be unsurprising given that reasoners with higher levels of analytic intelligence-perhaps those who have enjoyed philosophical training and selection-will tend to respond reflectively on various reasoning tasks (McCelroy andSeta 2003, #AUTHOR_TAG andWest 2000).']"

We ask whether women's occupations provide better conditions in areas that facilitate their dual role in society, such as flexible working schedule, as a tradeoff for low monetary rewards. Specifically, we examine how closely women's concentration in broader occupational categories, embedded in particular national contexts, is associated with gender differences in job quality. Utilizing the 2005 ISSP modules on work orientation, we find that women lag behind men on most dimensions of job quality. This result runs counter to the hypothesis that women's occupations compensate for their low wages and limited opportunities for promotion by providing better employment conditions. Just as important, however, the gender gap is found to narrow in most job quality dimensions as women's relative share in occupations grows.

Most theories of human reasoning have been based on content-independent formal rationality, whereas adaptive reasoning, ecological or evolutionary, has been little explored. We elaborate and test an evolutionary approach. Cosmides' (1989) social contract theory, using the Wason selection task. In the first part, we disentangle the theoretical concept of a ""social contract"" from that of a ""cheater-detection algorithm"". We demonstrate that the fact that a rule is perceived as a social contract--or a conditional permission or obligation, as Cheng and Holyoak (1985) proposed--is not sufficient to elicit Cosmides' striking results, which we replicated. The crucial issue is not semantic (the meaning of the rule), but pragmatic: whether a person is cued into the perspective of a party who can be cheated. In the second part, we distinguish between social contracts with bilateral and unilateral cheating options. Perspective change in contracts with bilateral cheating options turns P & not-Q responses into not-P & Q responses.

What is the groundbreaking new way to approach decision making described in this modern classic? We have all seen images of firefighters rescuing people from burning buildings and paramedics treating bombing victims. How do these individuals make the split-second decisions that save lives? Most studies of decision making, based on artificial tasks assigned in laboratory settings, view people as biased and unskilled.

The nature of such bias is not clear. Some authors claim that people aremere heuristic thinkers and are not aware that cued stereotypes might be inap-propriate. Other authors claim that people always detect the conflict between their stereotypical thinking and nor-mative reasoning, but simply fail to inhibit stereotypical thinking.Hence, it is unclearwhether heuristic bias should be attributed to a lack of conflict detection or a failure of inhibition. We introduce a neuroscientific approach that bears on this issue. Participants answered a classic deci-sion-making problem (the ''lawyer-engineer' ' problem) while the activation of brain regions believed to be involved in conflict detection (anterior cingulate) and response in-hibition (lateral prefrontal cortex) wasmonitored.

Ss are sometimes (a) unaware of the existence of a stimulus that importantly influenced a response, (b) unaware of the existence of the response, and (c) unaware that the stimulus has affected the response. It is proposed that when people attempt to report on their cognitive processes, that is, on the processes mediating the effects of a stimulus on a response, they do not do so on the basis of any true introspection. Instead, their reports are based on a priori, implicit causal theories, or judgments about the extent to which a particular stimulus is a plausible cause of a given response. This suggests that though people may not be able to observe directly their cognitive processes, they will sometimes be able to report accurately about them. Accurate reports will occur when influential stimuli are salient and are plausible causes of the responses they produce, and will not occur when stimuli are not salient or are not plausible causes.","For example, some participants were asked which of four pairs of stockings was the highest in quality (#AUTHOR_TAG and Wilson 1977).","['In some experiments, participants would be asked to make a judgment about an object or set of objects.', 'For example, some participants were asked which of four pairs of stockings was the highest in quality (#AUTHOR_TAG and Wilson 1977).', 'Then they were asked to report the process or reasons that lead to their judgment.', 'The vast majority of participants chose the rightmost pair of stockings.', 'Participants provided various reasons for choosing the right-most stocking-e.g., the rightmost pair of stockings seemed more finely knit.']",0,"['In some experiments, participants would be asked to make a judgment about an object or set of objects.', 'For example, some participants were asked which of four pairs of stockings was the highest in quality (#AUTHOR_TAG and Wilson 1977).', 'Then they were asked to report the process or reasons that lead to their judgment.']"

The second section distinguishes between two quite different versions of the hypothesis: one on which dual-process theory is construed as a thesis about cognitive tokens, the other on which it is a thesis about cognitive types. The third section sketches the reasons for rejecting the cognitive tokens version of dual-process theory. The fourth section highlights the virtues of the cognitive types version.

It is argued that since man is a selective, sequential information processing system with limited capacity, he is ill-suited for assessing probability distributions. Various studies attesting to man's difficulties in acting as an Òintuitive statisticianÓ are summarized in support of this contention. The importance of task characteristics on judgmental performance is also emphasized. A critical survey of the probability assessment literature is provided and organized around five topics: (1) the ÒmeaningfulnessÓ of probability assessments; (2) methods of eliciting distributions; (3) feedback and evaluation of assessors; (4) differential ability of groups of assessors and (5) the problems of eliciting a single distribution from a group of assessors. Conclusions from the analysis with respect to future work include the need to capitalize on cognitive simplification mechanisms; making assessors aware of both human limitations and the effects of task characteristics; and emphasizing feedback concerning the nature of the task at hand.","In order to begin the discussion of the systematic and predictable errors in reasoning, I will introduce the study of statistical reasoning-e.g., probabilistic inference (Bar-Hillel 1973, Chapman and Chapman 1967, 1969, Edwards et al 1968, Epley et al 2004, Epley and Golivoch 2001, Evans 1977, Galbraith and Underwood 1973, #AUTHOR_TAG 1975, Mans 1970, Rips 1975, Savage 1971, Sta�_l von Holstein 1971.","['In order to begin the discussion of the systematic and predictable errors in reasoning, I will introduce the study of statistical reasoning-e.g., probabilistic inference (Bar-Hillel 1973, Chapman and Chapman 1967, 1969, Edwards et al 1968, Epley et al 2004, Epley and Golivoch 2001, Evans 1977, Galbraith and Underwood 1973, #AUTHOR_TAG 1975, Mans 1970, Rips 1975, Savage 1971, Sta�_l von Holstein 1971.', 'Statistical reasoning tasks often required participants to describe something statistically or make an inference under conditions that impose uncertainty.', 'What these tasks reveal is that it is very common for both expert and novice reasoners to make errors in statistical reasoning tasks (for a helpful summary of this kind of research, see Tversky and Kahneman 1974).', ""Interestingly, patterns and similarities manifest in participants' errors, implying that these errors might have been systematic and perhaps symptomatic of a certain cognitive strategy."", 'Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and others have attempted provide an account of these systematic errors by introducing and characterizing these cognitive strategies: ""heuristics and biases"" (Evans 1984(Evans , 1989Gilovich Griffin and Kahneman 2002, Kahneman et al 2002, Levinson 1995, Tversky 1974.', 'Heuristics and biases reduce the complexity and higher-level computation required by certain tasks to simpler judgments (Tverksy and Kahneman 1974Kahneman , 1124.', ""In other words, Kahneman and Tversky claimed that participants recruited heuristics or biases when answering certain statistical questions-as opposed to performing complete calculations-and that the recruitment of these heuristics or biases accounted for the patterns and similarities in participants' errors-e.g., why participants' answers to various statistical questions were apparently insensitive to sample size (ibid., Kahneman andTversky 1973, Shortliffe andBuchanon 1975).""]",0,"['In order to begin the discussion of the systematic and predictable errors in reasoning, I will introduce the study of statistical reasoning-e.g., probabilistic inference (Bar-Hillel 1973, Chapman and Chapman 1967, 1969, Edwards et al 1968, Epley et al 2004, Epley and Golivoch 2001, Evans 1977, Galbraith and Underwood 1973, #AUTHOR_TAG 1975, Mans 1970, Rips 1975, Savage 1971, Sta�_l von Holstein 1971.', 'Statistical reasoning tasks often required participants to describe something statistically or make an inference under conditions that impose uncertainty.']"

Experiment 1 supported this hypothesis by showing that subjects frequently correctly evaluate valid ÒSome É notÓ conclusions but rarely produce them, even when they have evaluated them elsewhere. Explanations of these findings based on the use of superficial strategies were ruled out. Experiment 2 further supported the hypothesis by showing that performance increased across the no-conclusion, multiple-choice, and evaluation task formats, and that this effect generalized to problems containing the quantifier ÒonlyÓ. However, the initial hypothesis was rejected in light of Experiment 3, which found no difference between multiple-choice and no-conclusion formats when the number of allowable conclusions was controlled for. Nevertheless, superior performance remained in the evaluation format, and it is suggested that offered conclusions may be used as a goal for the reasoning process.

Reber""]","Abstract This paper is an attempt to put the work of the past several decades on the problems of implicit learning and unconscious cognition into an evolutionary context. Implicit learning is an inductive process whereby knowledge of a complex environment is acquired and used largely independently of awareness of either the process of acquisition or the nature of that which has been learned. Characterized this way, implicit learning theory can be viewed as an attempt to come to grips with the classic epistemological issues of knowledge acquisition, representation and use. The argument is made that the process, despite its seeming cognitive sophistication, is of considerable evolutionary antiquity and that it antedates awareness and the capacity for conscious control of mentation. Various classic heuristics from evolutionary biology are used to substantiate this claim and several specific entailments of this line of argument are outlined.","The associationist about intuition will start by outlining a fairly well accepted tenet of cognitive science: whether or not we are aware of it, we are more or less constantly learning associations between things and properties of things via experience-e.g., if we frequently experience two things or properties of things together, then we will begin to associate them (#AUTHOR_TAG 1989, 1992, Talbot 2009.","['Intuitive responses have also been characterized as, necessarily, associative (Talbot 2009).', 'Now I will express a concern about this associationist conception of the intuitive strategy.', 'The associationist about intuition will start by outlining a fairly well accepted tenet of cognitive science: whether or not we are aware of it, we are more or less constantly learning associations between things and properties of things via experience-e.g., if we frequently experience two things or properties of things together, then we will begin to associate them (#AUTHOR_TAG 1989, 1992, Talbot 2009.', 'The associationist will then point out that many associations are not consciously accessible and that one of the things consciously inaccessible associations do is influence consciously inaccessible judgments.', 'The final claim is this: ""intuitions are the conscious manifestation of [consciously inaccessible] judgments"" (Talbot,38).', ""While parts of this view enjoy impressive empirical support and while this view offers good descriptions of some intuitions, I am not convinced that this view can capture everything that falls under the umbrella of 'intuition' in either cognitive science or philosophy."", 'For example, it is rather unclear how an unconscious association would lead to an unconscious judgment that would lead to the response of ""10 cents"" on the aforementioned CRT question (Figure 2).', 'Now I can turn to the descriptions of what I have called the reflective strategy.', ""I will begin with 'ruled-based.'"", 'While I understand the motivation for this term-namely, that reflection and calculation might require some kind of logico-mathematico rule following process-it is not clear that this will be enough to distinguish the intuitive strategy from the reflective strategy.', 'After all, the processes which underlie intuition might, at bottom, also instantiate rule following.', 'In fact, even associative processes that are allegedly juxtaposed to rule-based processes (Sloman 1996) could be realized by a set of production rules (Eisenstadt and Simon 1997).', 'The plausibility of this claim becomes clearer when one thinks about how both associative and rule-based cognitive processes can be modeled mathematically and computationally-that is, both can be instantiated by rule-following systems.']",0,"['The associationist about intuition will start by outlining a fairly well accepted tenet of cognitive science: whether or not we are aware of it, we are more or less constantly learning associations between things and properties of things via experience-e.g., if we frequently experience two things or properties of things together, then we will begin to associate them (#AUTHOR_TAG 1989, 1992, Talbot 2009.', 'The associationist will then point out that many associations are not consciously accessible and that one of the things consciously inaccessible associations do is influence consciously inaccessible judgments.', 'The final claim is this: ""intuitions are the conscious manifestation of [consciously inaccessible] judgments"" (Talbot,38).', ""While parts of this view enjoy impressive empirical support and while this view offers good descriptions of some intuitions, I am not convinced that this view can capture everything that falls under the umbrella of 'intuition' in either cognitive science or philosophy."", 'For example, it is rather unclear how an unconscious association would lead to an unconscious judgment that would lead to the response of ""10 cents"" on the aforementioned CRT question (Figure 2).', 'Now I can turn to the descriptions of what I have called the reflective strategy.', ""I will begin with 'ruled-based.'""]"

Rips""]","The present study examined the effects of semantic structure on simple inductive judgments about category members. For a particular category (e.g., mammals), subjects were told that one of the species (e.g., horses) had a given property (an unknown disease) and were asked to estimate the proportion of instances in the other species that possessed the property. The results indicated that category structureÑin particular, the typicality of the speciesÑinfluenced subjects' judgments. These results were interpreted by models based on the following assumption: When little is known about the underlying distribution of a property, subjects assume that the distribution mirrors that of better-known properties. For this reason, if subjects learn that an unknown property is possessed by a typical species (i.e., one that shares many of its properties with other category members), they are more likely to generalize than if the same fact had been learned about an atypical species.","In order to begin the discussion of the systematic and predictable errors in reasoning, I will introduce the study of statistical reasoning-e.g., probabilistic inference (Bar-Hillel 1973, Chapman and Chapman 1967, 1969, Edwards et al 1968, Epley et al 2004, Epley and Golivoch 2001, Evans 1977, Galbraith and Underwood 1973, Hogarth 1975, Mans 1970, #AUTHOR_TAG 1975, Savage 1971, Sta�_l von Holstein 1971.","['In order to begin the discussion of the systematic and predictable errors in reasoning, I will introduce the study of statistical reasoning-e.g., probabilistic inference (Bar-Hillel 1973, Chapman and Chapman 1967, 1969, Edwards et al 1968, Epley et al 2004, Epley and Golivoch 2001, Evans 1977, Galbraith and Underwood 1973, Hogarth 1975, Mans 1970, #AUTHOR_TAG 1975, Savage 1971, Sta�_l von Holstein 1971.', 'Statistical reasoning tasks often required participants to describe something statistically or make an inference under conditions that impose uncertainty.', 'What these tasks reveal is that it is very common for both expert and novice reasoners to make errors in statistical reasoning tasks (for a helpful summary of this kind of research, see Tversky and Kahneman 1974).', ""Interestingly, patterns and similarities manifest in participants' errors, implying that these errors might have been systematic and perhaps symptomatic of a certain cognitive strategy."", 'Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and others have attempted provide an account of these systematic errors by introducing and characterizing these cognitive strategies: ""heuristics and biases"" (Evans 1984(Evans , 1989Gilovich Griffin and Kahneman 2002, Kahneman et al 2002, Levinson 1995, Tversky 1974.', 'Heuristics and biases reduce the complexity and higher-level computation required by certain tasks to simpler judgments (Tverksy and Kahneman 1974Kahneman , 1124.', ""In other words, Kahneman and Tversky claimed that participants recruited heuristics or biases when answering certain statistical questions-as opposed to performing complete calculations-and that the recruitment of these heuristics or biases accounted for the patterns and similarities in participants' errors-e.g., why participants' answers to various statistical questions were apparently insensitive to sample size (ibid., Kahneman andTversky 1973, Shortliffe andBuchanon 1975).""]",0,"['In order to begin the discussion of the systematic and predictable errors in reasoning, I will introduce the study of statistical reasoning-e.g., probabilistic inference (Bar-Hillel 1973, Chapman and Chapman 1967, 1969, Edwards et al 1968, Epley et al 2004, Epley and Golivoch 2001, Evans 1977, Galbraith and Underwood 1973, Hogarth 1975, Mans 1970, #AUTHOR_TAG 1975, Savage 1971, Sta�_l von Holstein 1971.', 'Statistical reasoning tasks often required participants to describe something statistically or make an inference under conditions that impose uncertainty.']"

CC1460,54847651,Intuitive and Reflective Responses in Philosophy,Nick Byrd,Unit weighting schemes for decision making,"[""Hillel J. Einhorn"", ""Robin M. Hogarth""]","The general problem of forming composite variables from components is prevalent in many types of research. A major aspect of this problem is the weighting of components. Assuming that composites are a linear function of their components, composites formed by using standard linear regression are compared to those formed by simple unit weighting schemes, i.e., where predictor variables are weighted by 1.0. The degree of similarity between the two composites, expressed as the minimum possible correlation between them, is derived. This minimum correlation is found to be an increasing function of the intercorrelation of the components and a decreasing function of the number of predictors. Moreover, the minimum is fairly high for most applied situations. The predictive ability of the two methods is compared. For predictive purposes, unit weighting is a viable alternative to standard regression methods because unit weights: (1) are not estimated from the data and therefore do not ÒconsumeÓ degrees of freedom; (2) are ÒestimatedÓ without error (i.e., they have no standard errors); (3) cannot reverse the ÒtrueÓ relative weights of the variables. Predictive ability of the two methods is examined as a function of sample size and number of predictors. It is shown that unit weighting will be superior to regression in certain situations and not greatly inferior in others. Various implications for using unit weighting are discussed and applications to several decision making situations are illustrated.","First, Gigerenzer and colleagues introduce their audience to a series of strategies, each of which is ""biased"" to varying degrees, that can be used to make estimations under conditions of uncertaintye.g., the ""take the best"" strategy (Gigerenzer and Goldstein 1996) inspired by statistical models using ""equal weights"" or ""tallying"" strategies (Dawes 1974, Dawes and Corrigan 1974, #AUTHOR_TAG and Hogarth 1975, Schmidt 1971.","['Cue Gerd Gigerenzer (2008).', 'Gigerenzer and colleagues have skillfully provided an account of how recruiting heuristical and biased reasoning strategies instead of more complex and thorough reasoning strategies might, overall, be a good idea.', 'I imagine some readers will already have thought of a reason to rely on heuristics: they are more economical than the alternatives!', 'And if there is a limited economy of cognitive energy, then recruiting cognitively efficient reasoning strategies is rational, right?', 'This is roughly how Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and their ilk explain the use of heuristics and biases.', ""This, however, is not Gigerenzer and colleagues' claim.

James (1890) to contemporary psychologists, have argued that forgetting is the key to proper functioning of memory. The authors elaborate on the notion of beneficial forgetting by proposing that loss of information aids inference heuristics that exploit mnemonic information. To this end, the authors bring together 2 research programs that take an ecological approach to studying cognition. Specifically, they implement fast and frugal heuristics within the ACT-R cognitive architecture. Simulations of the recognition heuristic, which relies on systematic failures of recognition to infer which of 2 objects scores higher on a criterion value, demonstrate that forgetting can boost accuracy by increasing the chances that only 1 object is recognized. Simulations of the fluency heuristic, which arrives at the same inference on the basis of the speed with which objects are recognized, indicate that forgetting aids the discrimination between the objects' recognition speeds.","Comparing these estimation strategies across multiple data sets reveals that simpler-or more biased-strategies actually outperform models that are more thorough and sensitive to variance in the evidence-i.e., variance in the sample data set (Chater et al 2003, Goldstein and Gigerenzer 2002, Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier 2011, and #AUTHOR_TAG and Hertwig 2005.","['Cue Gerd Gigerenzer (2008).', 'Gigerenzer and colleagues have skillfully provided an account of how recruiting heuristical and biased reasoning strategies instead of more complex and thorough reasoning strategies might, overall, be a good idea.', 'I imagine some readers will already have thought of a reason to rely on heuristics: they are more economical than the alternatives!', 'And if there is a limited economy of cognitive energy, then recruiting cognitively efficient reasoning strategies is rational, right?', 'This is roughly how Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and their ilk explain the use of heuristics and biases.', ""This, however, is not Gigerenzer and colleagues' claim.

But more recently it has been argued that classical rationality should also be rejected even as normative standards for human reasoning. For example, Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996) and Gigerenzer and Todd (1999a) argue that reasoning involves ""fast and frugal"" algorithms which are not justified by rational norms, but which succeed in the environment. They provide three lines of argument for this view, based on: (A) the importance of the environment; (B) the existence of cognitive limitations; and (C) the fact that an algorithm with no apparent rational basis, Take-the-Best, succeeds in an judgment task (judging which of two cities is the larger; based on lists of features of each city). We reconsider (A)-(C), arguing that standard patterns of explanation in psychology and the social and biological sciences, use rational norms to explain why simple cognitive algorithms can succeed. We also present new computer simulations that compare Take-the-Best with other cognitive models (which use connectionist, exemplar-based, and decision-tree algorithms). Although Take-the-Best still performs well, it does not perform noticeably better than the other models. We conclude that these results provide no strong reason to prefer Take-the-Best over alternative cognitive models. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

This study tests the theoretical model by surveying 395 users with viewing or posting experience in an online discussion forum. The empirical results of this study verify that the central variable (argument quality) directly and indirectly drives the likelihood of e-WOM adoption via cognitive and affective attitudes, whereas the peripheral cue (source credibility) directly and indirectly drives the likelihood of e-WOM adoption via cognitive attitudes only. However, affective attitudes rather than cognitive attitudes significantly determine the likelihood of e-WOM adoption, implying the attitude-intention link is valid in the central route to persuasion. Additionally, the use of central and peripheral routes to form attitudes is influenced by perceived control in online searching.

The FORs of both high- and low-capacity reasoners were responsive to conflict, such that FORs were lower for conflict relative to non-conflict problems. Consistent with the quantity hypothesis, high-capacity reasoners made a greater distinction between conflict and non-conflict items on measures of Type 2 thinking, namely, rethinking time and probability of changing answers. In contrast to the quality hypothesis, however, this rethinking time did not advantage the ability of the high-capacity group to produce normative answers, except for the base rate task.

Using linguistic and textual analysis, he argues that Centrality is false. He also suggests that because most philosophers accept Centrality, they have mistaken beliefs about their own methods. To put my own views on the table: I do not have a large theoretical stake in the status of intuitions, but unreflectively I find it fairly obvious that many philosophers, including myself, appeal to intuitions. Cappelen's arguments make a provocative challenge to this unreflective background conception. So it is interesting to work through the arguments to see what they might and might not show. I think we can articulate a minimal (not heavily theoretical) notion of intuition that captures something of the core everyday philosophical usage of the term, and that captures the sense in which it seems obvious that philosophers rely on intuitions.

The finite model generation problem in the first-order logic is a generalization of the propositional satisfiability (SAT) problem. An essential algorithm for solving the problem is backtracking search. In this paper, we show how to improve such a search procedure by lemma learning. For efficiency reasons, we represent the lemmas by propositional formulas and use a SAT solver to perform the necessary reasoning. We have extended the first-order model generator SEM, combining it with the SAT solver SATO. Experimental results show that the search time may be reduced significantly on many problems.","In an effort to highlight reasoning that might be isomorphic to philosophical reasoning, I will turn to logical reasoninge.g., deductive and conditional reasoning-the study of which has revealed further systematic errors in reasoning (Barwise 1993, Bell and Johnson-Laird-1998, #AUTHOR_TAG 1994, Cummins 1991, Evans Clibbens and Rood 1996, Evans, Dugan and Revlin 1990, Hardman and Payne 1995, Johnson-Laird 1999, Johnson-Laird and Byrne 2002, Shynkaruk and Thompson 2006, Thompson 2010, Turner and Thompson 2009, Wetherick and Golhooly 1990.","['Since the time of these results about statistical reasoning and introspective access to reasoning, other forms of reason have also been studied, and with similar results.', 'In an effort to highlight reasoning that might be isomorphic to philosophical reasoning, I will turn to logical reasoninge.g., deductive and conditional reasoning-the study of which has revealed further systematic errors in reasoning (Barwise 1993, Bell and Johnson-Laird-1998, #AUTHOR_TAG 1994, Cummins 1991, Evans Clibbens and Rood 1996, Evans, Dugan and Revlin 1990, Hardman and Payne 1995, Johnson-Laird 1999, Johnson-Laird and Byrne 2002, Shynkaruk and Thompson 2006, Thompson 2010, Turner and Thompson 2009, Wetherick and Golhooly 1990.']",0,"['In an effort to highlight reasoning that might be isomorphic to philosophical reasoning, I will turn to logical reasoninge.g., deductive and conditional reasoning-the study of which has revealed further systematic errors in reasoning (Barwise 1993, Bell and Johnson-Laird-1998, #AUTHOR_TAG 1994, Cummins 1991, Evans Clibbens and Rood 1996, Evans, Dugan and Revlin 1990, Hardman and Payne 1995, Johnson-Laird 1999, Johnson-Laird and Byrne 2002, Shynkaruk and Thompson 2006, Thompson 2010, Turner and Thompson 2009, Wetherick and Golhooly 1990.']"

The Townsend (2007) phylogenetic informativeness provides a unique empirical metric for guiding marker selection. However, no software or automated methodology to evaluate sequence alignments and estimate the phylogenetic informativeness metric has been available. Results Here, we present PhyDesign, a platform-independent online application that implements the Townsend (2007) phylogenetic informativeness analysis, providing a quantitative prediction of the utility of loci to solve specific phylogenetic questions. An easy-to-use interface facilitates uploading of alignments and ultrametric trees to calculate and depict profiles of informativeness over specified time ranges, and provides rankings of locus prioritization for epochs of interest. Conclusions By providing these profiles, PhyDesign facilitates locus prioritization increasing the efficiency of sequencing for phylogenetic purposes compared to traditional studies with more laborious and low capacity screening methods, as well as increasing the accuracy of phylogenetic studies.

The conditions of this study were constrained but allowed for systematic investigation of certain parameters. The starting point for the study was a four-taxon tree in the ""Felsenstein zone,"" representing a difficult phylogenetic problem with an extreme situation of long branch attraction. Taxa were added sequentially to this tree in a manner specifically designed to break up the long branches, and for each tree data matrices of different sizes were simulated. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed from these data using the criteria of parsimony and maximum likelihood. Phylogenetic accuracy was measured in three ways: (1) proportion of trees that are completely correct, (2) proportion of correctly reconstructed branches in all trees, and (3) proportion of trees in which the original four-taxon statement is correctly reconstructed. Accuracy improved dramatically with the addition of taxa and much more slowly with the addition of characters. If taxa can be added to break up long branches, it is much more preferable to add taxa than characters.","In general, empirical and simulation results have justified a claim that greater in-group taxon sampling permits the effective usage of faster evolving characters (#AUTHOR_TAG 1998;Hillis 1998;Poe 2003;Hedtke et al. 2006), leading to a prediction of a slightly higher optimal rate.","['A more complete theory that directly integrates noise by estimating a length and thus the relative scaling for this internode is certainly desirable.', 'Until then, signal alone as in the phylogenetic informativeness profile correlates with resolution achievable across loci.', 'Profiles may productively be used as a quantitative metric.', 'Generally such usage will improve inference.', '(But not always!', 'It would not be a ""prediction"" if it always predicted correctly.)', 'Thus, experimental design should not only incorporate evaluation of the relative quantification inherent to profiles of phylogenetic informativeness, but when feasible should incorporate judicious discounting of the expected value of sets of characters whose profiles of informativeness peak more recently than the epoch of interest.', 'Moreover, additional theory that accounts for the predicted length of the internodes in question and therefore the scaling relationship between signal and noise should be a high priority.', 'Klopfstein et al.

CC1478,20652885,Taxon Sampling and the Optimal Rates of Evolution for Phylogenetic Inference,Jeffrey Townsend,Evaluation of the Strategy of Long-Branch Subdivision to Improve the Accuracy of Phylogenetic Methods,"[""Steven Poe""]","Methods for reconstructing evolutionary history are sensitive to the number and position of taxa included in the analysis (e.g., Gauthier et al., 1988; Hendy and Penny, 1989; Lecointre et al., 1993; Poe, 1998). Figure 1 illustrates this phenomenon using parsimony analyses of a sample of four Anolis lizard species from a large matrix of morphological and molecular data (Poe, 2001). Any of the three possible relationships for these species can be obtained by including appropriate additional species in the same analysis. In addition to demonstrating the instability of results relative to taxon sampling, this example shows conclusively that addition of taxa may be beneficial to the accuracy of a phylogenetic analysis but also may be detrimental to accuracy. This conclusion holds because it is possible to change any of the topological results either by adding or by subtracting taxa, and even though we do not know which of these three trees is the true tree, we can assume that one of them is correct and two of them are wrong. One might think that the sensitivity to taxon sampling shown in Figure 1 is restricted to certain methods or to poorly supported trees. Unfortunately this is not the case, as shown in the example in Figure 2. These trees were reconstructed using the mitochondrial DNA sequence data of Jackman et al. (1999) for Anolis lizards. Tree a in Figure 2 is obtained when these taxa are analyzed alone using maximum likelihood and minimum evolution under complex models (HKY + G; Hasegawa et al., 1985; Yang, 1994; parameter values estimated from data) and using parsimony with equal weights for all character changes. Tree b is obtained using these same methods but running the analyses including three other lizard species. This comparison shows that sensitivity to taxon sampling may occur even with strongly supported trees and diverse methods of estimation (and shows that high bootstrap values and strongly supported congruence between methods are not necessarily predictors of accuracy). The above examples show the potentially extreme sensitivity of phylogenetic methods to taxon sampling, but they are of little help in devising a taxon sampling strategy for maximizing the accuracy of a phylogenetic analysis. When a researcher is interested in the relationships of a set of clades from which exemplar taxa are chosen, is it better or worse to include additional taxa in the analysis? Clearly, simply including more taxa without additional character information can be detrimental to accuracy, because more characters are needed to resolve a greater number of nodes. However, addition of more taxa adds information about evolutionary history (e.g., Gauthier et al., 1988), which seems likely to have a positive effect on accuracy. Given these potentially opposing effects, what is the best taxon-sampling strategy for maximizing the accuracy of phylogenetic analyses? Phylogenies that include lineages that have undergone extensive evolution are difficult to reconstruct because of the phenomenon of long branch attraction (Felsenstein, 1978; Huelsenbeck and Hillis, 1993). Thus, a beneficial sampling strategy might involve shortening long branches by including additional taxa, assuming that such taxa exist (Hendy and Penny, 1989). This strategy has been evaluated for the parsimony method by Graybeal (1998) and by Poe and Swofford (1999). Graybeal fulfilled Hendy and Penny's (1989) prediction that long-branch subdivision can have a strong beneficial effect on the accuracy of estimation of four-taxon trees in the Felsenstein zone of two long opposing branches and a short internal branch. Poe and Swofford (1999) examined a wider range of model trees and discovered several conditions of the kind discussed by Zharkikh and Li (1993) under which long-branch subdivision was detrimental to accuracy. The taxon sampling strategy of long-branch subdivision (LBS) has not been examined for methods other than parsimony. Poe and Swofford (1999) suggested that phylogenetic methods that take branch lengths into account are less likely to be affected by the problems of LBS that afflicted their application of the parsimony method.

This topic is receiving increasing attention, in part because recent studies have reached a con-fusing diversity of conclusions about the effects of taxonomic sampling. For in-stance, contrast the conclusions reached in two recent papers on this topic: If the evolutionary question of interest does not re-quire a large number of taxa, it seems best to use fewer taxa because larger trees are more likely to contain inconsistent branches. (Kim, 1996:372) Including large numbers of taxa in an analysis may be the best way to ensure phylogenetic accuracy.

These have included rapidly evolving mitochondrial genes, which are most appropriate for studies of closely related species, and slowly evolving nuclear ribosomal RNA genes, which have been most useful for resolution of deep branches within the Decapoda. Here we examine the utility of the nuclear gene that encodes arginine kinase for phylogenetic reconstruction at intermediate levels (relationships among genera and families) within the decapod infraorder Brachyura (the true crabs). Analyses based on arginine kinase sequences were compared and combined with those for the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene. All of the genera in our taxon sample were resolved with high support with arginine kinase data alone. However, some of these genera were grouped into clades that are in conflict with recognized brachyuran families. A phylogeny based on cytochrome oxidase I was consistent with the arginine kinase phylogeny, but with weaker support. A recently proposed measure of phylogenetic informativeness indicated that arginine kinase was generally more informative than cytochrome oxidase I for relationships above the level of genus. Combined analysis of data from both genes provided strong support for clades that are in conflict with current assignments of genera to the families Epialtidae, Mithracidae, Pisidae, and Portunidae.",There are both theoretical (Bandelt and Dress 1986) and empirical (Townsend 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG and Neigel 2008;Townsend et al. 2008;Schoch et al. 2009) reasons to believe that the quartet results of Townsend ( 2007) may be productively applied to trees with greater than four taxa.,"['A more complete theory that directly integrates noise by estimating a length and thus the relative scaling for this internode is certainly desirable.', 'Until then, signal alone as in the phylogenetic informativeness profile correlates with resolution achievable across loci.', 'Profiles may productively be used as a quantitative metric.', 'Generally such usage will improve inference.', '(But not always!', 'It would not be a ""prediction"" if it always predicted correctly.)', 'Thus, experimental design should not only incorporate evaluation of the relative quantification inherent to profiles of phylogenetic informativeness, but when feasible should incorporate judicious discounting of the expected value of sets of characters whose profiles of informativeness peak more recently than the epoch of interest.', 'Moreover, additional theory that accounts for the predicted length of the internodes in question and therefore the scaling relationship between signal and noise should be a high priority.', 'Klopfstein et al.

It is the dominant motif of much writing about community conservation and the integration of conservation with development. However, we should be sceptical of it for several reasons. First, it implies that the weak can defeat the agendas of the strong. Second, the principle ignores the fact that inequality and injustice tend to be perpetrated about the globe. It is not existence of poverty or injustice that will cause problems for conservation, but their distribution within society. Third, a detailed case study from the Mkomazi Game Reserve in Tanzania shows how conservation can flourish despite local opposition. Advocates of community conservation need to pay more attention to fortress conservation's strengths and especially its powerful myths and repre  sentations.

In Tanzania, these processes could significantly alter the terrain in the conflict between local land rights and state wildlife conservation.

It is informed largely by Scott's concept of everyday resistance, which considers the informal subtle politics involved in social conflicts where there are con- straints on the ability of some people to take open, formal action. These ideas are critiqued and adapted to the particular context of conservation regula- tion, which is distinct from many other types of rural conflict. In particular, it recognises the importance of continuing banned livelihood practices such as hunting or farming in resistance, and the particular symbolism this has in conflicts. It also shows the importance of not just social factors in these con- flicts, but also the role of physical properties of natural resources in deter- mining the form of resistance. As well as the theoretical contribution, by showing the variety of responses to this resistance this paper aims to make conservation practitioners more aware of the forms local resistance can take. Rather than being a simple call for a more socially just conservation, it goes beyond this to provide a tool to make conservation better for both local com- munities and biodiversity.","They may chose to resist these costs through formal political opposition such as legal challenges, lobbying, and protest marches (e.g., Sullivan 2003), but more frequently through more subtle, indirect protests such as non-cooperation and sabotage (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007).","['The principle of local support assumes that local people who are dissatis�_ ed with conservation because of the costs and constraints it imposes on them will resist and this will cause conservation efforts to fail.', 'Local people may become dissatis�_ ed with protected areas because they displace them from their homes, restrict their livelihoods by limiting access to natural resources, fail to deliver promised bene�_ ts, and other reasons (West and Brockington 2006).', 'They may chose to resist these costs through formal political opposition such as legal challenges, lobbying, and protest marches (e.g., Sullivan 2003), but more frequently through more subtle, indirect protests such as non-cooperation and sabotage (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007).', 'In short, the principle argues that dissatis�_ ed local people have the power to make protected areas fail.', 'Failure is rarely de�_ ned but is implied as an inability to protect biodiversity (particularly emblematic species) within a protected area, or the weakening or collapse of a protected area as an institution.']",0,"['The principle of local support assumes that local people who are dissatis_ ed with conservation because of the costs and constraints it imposes on them will resist and this will cause conservation efforts to fail.', 'Local people may become dissatis_ ed with protected areas because they displace them from their homes, restrict their livelihoods by limiting access to natural resources, fail to deliver promised bene_ ts, and other reasons (West and Brockington 2006).', 'They may chose to resist these costs through formal political opposition such as legal challenges, lobbying, and protest marches (e.g., Sullivan 2003), but more frequently through more subtle, indirect protests such as non-cooperation and sabotage (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007).', 'In short, the principle argues that dissatis_ ed local people have the power to make protected areas fail.', 'Failure is rarely de_ ned but is implied as an inability to protect biodiversity (particularly emblematic species) within a protected area, or the weakening or collapse of a protected area as an institution.']"

It has been controversial because community development objectives are not necessarily consistent with conservation objectives in a given case. I examined CBC from two angles. First, CBC can be seen in the context of paradigm shifts in ecology and applied ecology. I identified three conceptual shifts-toward a systems view, toward the inclusion of humans in the ecosystem, and toward participatory approaches to ecosystem management-that are interrelated and pertain to an understanding of ecosystems as complex adaptive systems in which humans are an integral part. Second, I investigated the feasibility of CBC, as informed by a number of emerging interdisciplinary fields that have been pursuing various aspects of coupled systems of humans and nature. These fields-common property, traditional ecological knowledge, environmental ethics, political ecology, and environmental history-provide insights for CBC. They may contribute to the development of an interdisciplinary conservation science with a more sophisticated understanding of social-ecological interactions. The lessons from these fields include the importance of cross-scale conservation, adaptive comanagement, the question of incentives and multiple stakeholders, the use of traditional ecological knowledge, and development of a cross-cultural conservation ethic.","It forms the basis of many strategies that aim to raise support for protected areas amongst local people as a path to conserving biodiversity, and is taken as a relatively unproblematic truth Local support and protected area success / 73 in papers in conservation journals (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG 2004;Bulte and Rondeau 2005).","['Issues of the relationship between protected areas and local communities are of vital importance to biodiversity conservation.', ""A better understanding of how they interact, in�� uence, and shape one another allows us to improve our ability to conserve the areas' biodiversity while maximising bene�_ ts, or at least minimising costs, to the populations living in and around protected areas, who are often amongst the most marginalised groups in society."", 'This paper refers to one particular debate within this broad arena, the question of whether the support and consent of local populations are essential prerequisites for the success of protected areas, which Brockington (2004) refers to as ""the principle of local support"".', 'This notion states that if individual protected areas are to have any long term continuity as institutions, and if they are to be effective in preserving the biodiversity contained within them, then local people must support them.', 'Discontented local people will resist protected area regulations, protest against them, refuse to cooperate with authorities and participate in their plans.', 'This will consequently undermine both the institution of a protected area and the health of the biodiversity contained within it.', 'The principle has an interesting position in conservation strategy, discourse, and practice.', 'As Brockington (2004) notes, it is strongly expressed in keynote speeches and declarations at major conservation meetings.', 'David Western (2001: 202), an in�� uential conservationist and former director of the Kenya Wildlife Service argues that ""a fallacy of protectionism is that we can ignore the costs locally"".', 'The president of the IUCN\'s opening speech to the fourth World Parks Congress stated that ""quite simply, if local people do not support protected areas, then protected areas cannot last"" (Ramphal 1993: 56).', 'Adrian Phillips argues that ""any approach that marginalises the local community in decision-making is doomed to failure"", and that there is an ""iron rule that no protected area can succeed for long in the teeth of local opposition"" (Borrini-Feyerabend et al. 2002-quotes taken from Brockington 2004.', 'It forms the basis of many strategies that aim to raise support for protected areas amongst local people as a path to conserving biodiversity, and is taken as a relatively unproblematic truth Local support and protected area success / 73 in papers in conservation journals (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG 2004;Bulte and Rondeau 2005).', 'It is implicit in the thinking of donors funding conservation and NGOs, and in the declarations emerging from the last World Parks Congress held in Durban in 2003 on what makes conservation successful and what strategies should be taken in the following decade.', 'In particular, building support for protected areas from local communities and other constituencies was one of the seven themes of the Congress, not only out of recognition of the contribution that conservation can make to well-being and other reasons, but also because it is presumed that support makes conservation more effective.', 'A considerable number of studies on the social relations of protected areas are primarily or solely designed to measure the attitudes of local people towards protected areas, with the implicit or explicit assumption that such attitudes have a crucial bearing on the success or otherwise of protected areas (e.g., Kideghesho et al. 2007, Triguero-Mas et al. 2009.', 'Remarkably, given that they disagree on many other issues, it is accepted as true by advocates of community-based conservation as well as those supporting the ""fences and �_ nes"" approaches, even if they differ in how they think it should be achieved (e.g., Brandon et al. 1998).']",0,"['It forms the basis of many strategies that aim to raise support for protected areas amongst local people as a path to conserving biodiversity, and is taken as a relatively unproblematic truth Local support and protected area success / 73 in papers in conservation journals (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG 2004;Bulte and Rondeau 2005).']"

In our model economic development takes place and continues in the long run due to the emergence of new sectors, which can compensate for the diminishing ability of mature sectors to create employment and growth. Each new sector is created by a pervasive innovation, which creates a new market and into and out of which there are entry and exit of firms. Depending on the inter-temporal coordination of the maturation of older sectors and of the maturation of new ones our model can give rise to development paths with growth rates ranging from high to negative, to fluctuations, to bubbles and to chaos. In the construction of our model we found inspiration in a number of growth models, both endogenous and evolutionary as well as on empirical work on structural change. The model also bears some similarity of style to history friendly models. Its unique feature is that it gives rise to an endogenously variable number of sectors. Unless new sectors are exact substitutes of older ones the model gives rise to growing variety. In fact, the main objective for which the model was initially constructed was to test some propositions implying that variety growth is a necessary requirement for long term economic development. Within our model the ability to create new sectors at the right times is the crucial determinant of the growth potential of an economic system. Thus, inter country differences in the barriers to entry into new sectors can be expected to give rise to different rates of growth and in the end to increasingly skewed world income distribution. --Technological Change,Economic Development,Economic Variety,Entry Barriers","For example, Adamopoulous and Restuccia (2014) and Donovan (2014) point to the scale or risk of farming; Restuccia et al.

Woollams"", ""Elisa Cooper-Pye"", ""John R. Hodges"", ""Karalyn Patterson""]","This study was designed to explore the nature of the anomia that is a defining feature of semantic dementia. Using a pool of 225 sets of picture naming data from 78 patients, we assessed the effects on naming accuracy of several characteristics of the target objects or their names: familiarity, frequency, age of acquisition and semantic domain (living/non-living). We also analysed the distribution of different error types according to the severity of the naming deficit. A particular focus of the study was the impact on naming of a previously unconsidered variable: the typicality of an object within its semantic category. This factor had a major influence both on naming success and on the proportions of different error types. Moreover, and increasingly so with declining naming accuracy, the patients' single-word incorrect responses were more typical than the target names. The observed effects of typicality sit well within models of semantic memory that represent concepts in terms of patterns of co-occurrence of constituent features. The results add to a growing body of evidence that, throughout the progressive deterioration of conceptual knowledge that characterises semantic dementia, both accuracy of performance and the nature of error responses are increasingly determined by the domain-specific aspects of typicality relevant to the task in question.","Anomia is characteristic of SD and has received substantial research attention (see #AUTHOR_TAG, Cooper-Pye, Hodges, & Patterson, 2008, for an analysis of a large corpus of SD naming errors).","['Anomia is characteristic of SD and has received substantial research attention (see #AUTHOR_TAG, Cooper-Pye, Hodges, & Patterson, 2008, for an analysis of a large corpus of SD naming errors).', 'We expect to see substitution and omission errors on open class items as appropriate words will be too unstable or too degraded to be retrieved successfully (Nickels & Howard, 2000).', 'As noted above, there is evidence that the free speech of patients with SD shows an increased use of light terms, so we will look specifically for substitution errors consisting of light verbs and what we will call light nouns (e.g.', ""'thing', 'stuff' and 'place').""]",0,"['Anomia is characteristic of SD and has received substantial research attention (see #AUTHOR_TAG, Cooper-Pye, Hodges, & Patterson, 2008, for an analysis of a large corpus of SD naming errors).']"

The model used a learning algorithm that resulted in a sharing of responsibility (or ""division of labor"") between syntactic and semantic inputs for lexical activation according to their predictive power. Semantically rich, or ""heavy"", verbs in the model came to rely on semantic cues more than on syntactic cues, whereas semantically impoverished, or ""light"", verbs relied more on syntactic cues. When the syntactic and semantic inputs were lesioned, the model exhibited patterns of production characteristic of agrammatic and anomic aphasic patients, respectively. Anomic models tended to lose the ability to retrieve heavy verbs, whereas agrammatic models were more impaired in retrieving light verbs.

Results from a longitudinal study. in which three patients with semantic dementia each described the Cookie Theft picture on three occasions during the progression of their disease, confirmed these predictions. An additional cross-sectional analysis, adding narratives from a larger number of cases, demonstrated that the decline in ability to produce suitable words for the picture description is closely related to the extent of semantic impairment as measured in tests of word comprehension and production.

BOZEAT"", ""M. A. L. RALPH"", ""K. PATTERSON"", ""J. R. HODGES""]","The clinical presentation of patients with semantic dementia is dominated by anomia and poor verbal comprehension. Although a number of researchers have argued that these patients have impaired comprehension of non-verbal as well as verbal stimuli, the evidence for semantic deterioration is mainly derived from tasks that include some form of verbal input or output. Few studies have investigated semantic impairment using entirely non-verbal assessments and the few exceptions have been based on results from single cases ([3]: Breedin SD, Saffran EM, Coslett HB. Reversal of the concreteness effect in a patient with semantic dementia. Cognitive Neuropsychology 1994;11:617-660, [12]: Graham KS, Becker JT, Patterson K, Hodges JR.

Simulating and assessing poor verbal comprehension in a case of progressive fluent aphasia. Cognitive Neuropsychology, (in-press). This study employed sound recognition and semantic association tasks to investigate the nature of the verbal and non-verbal comprehension deficit in 10 patients with semantic dementia. The patients were impaired on both verbal and non-verbal conditions of the assessments, and their accuracy on these tasks was directly related to their scores on a range of other tests requiring access to semantic memory. Further analyses revealed that performance was graded by concept and sound familiarity and, in addition, identified significant item consistency across the different conditions of the tasks. These results support the notion that the patients' deficits across all modalities were due to degradation within a single, central network of conceptual knowledge. There were also reliable differences between conditions. The sound-picture matching task proved to be more sensitive to semantic impairment than the word-picture matching equivalent, and the patients performed significantly better on the picture than word version of a semantic association test. We propose that these differences arise directly from the nature of the mapping between input modality and semantic memory. Words and sounds have an arbitrary relationship with meaning while pictures benefit from a degree of systematicity with conceptual knowledge about the object.","Patients are poor at matching pictures of objects to their characteristic sounds as well as their names (#AUTHOR_TAG, Lambon Ralph, Garrard, Patterson, & Hodges, 2000) and they show impaired use of objects, especially less common ones (e.g. a corkscrew or stethoscope, Bozeat, Lambon Ralph, Patterson, & Hodges, 2002).","['The striking feature of SD is a fairly selective deterioration of semantic information across all modalities of input and output, both verbal and non-verbal.', 'Non-verbal manifestations of the deficit have been found in delayed copy drawing, where distinctive features are lost (e.g. the hump of the camel) and common features intrude, particularly for living things which share many attributes (e.g. a duck is drawn with four legs; Bozeat et al., 2003).', 'Patients are poor at matching pictures of objects to their characteristic sounds as well as their names (#AUTHOR_TAG, Lambon Ralph, Garrard, Patterson, & Hodges, 2000) and they show impaired use of objects, especially less common ones (e.g. a corkscrew or stethoscope, Bozeat, Lambon Ralph, Patterson, & Hodges, 2002).', 'At mild-moderate stages, when SD patients can still perform categorisation tasks, they are better are categorising pictures at the general level (i.e.', 'animal or non-living thing), than at the basic level (e.g.', 'dog or bird), and better at the basic level than at the specific level (e.g.', 'labrador or collie) (Rogers & Patterson, 2007).', 'Verbal manifestations of the semantic deficit are seen in impaired object naming and word-to-picture matching, such that these tests are routinely used in diagnosis (Hodges & Patterson, 2007).', 'In free speech, the anomia typical of SD results in open class items being replaced by more general, indefinite terms (e.g.', ""'thing ', 'stuff' and 'place') and an increased reliance on high frequency, high familiarity items and pronouns (Bird, Lambon Ralph, Patterson, & Hodges, 2000).""]",0,"['The striking feature of SD is a fairly selective deterioration of semantic information across all modalities of input and output, both verbal and non-verbal.', 'Patients are poor at matching pictures of objects to their characteristic sounds as well as their names (#AUTHOR_TAG, Lambon Ralph, Garrard, Patterson, & Hodges, 2000) and they show impaired use of objects, especially less common ones (e.g. a corkscrew or stethoscope, Bozeat, Lambon Ralph, Patterson, & Hodges, 2002).']"

A more appropriate grammatical description, defined in terms of the complexity of the derivational properties of verb forms and the complexity of the semantic notions that verb forms can express, is presented which can handle facts about English and Italian agrammatism. However, this type of description is shown to be incapable of accounting in a natural way for certain further facts about agrammatic productions in English and Italian which need to be explained. A psycholinguistic model compatible with the grammatical description is then presented to account for these facts. The model, an elaboration of M. Garrett's (1975, in G. Bower (ed.), Psychology of learning and motivation, New York: Academic Press, Vol. 9) model of normal sentence production, involves the accessing of two stores during syntactic processing--one containing phrase fragments, the other function words.

This paper proposes one possibli&urce of such constraints. Evidence is reviewed indicating that the syntax of sentences may .to some degree reflect the transient processing demands of lexical retrieval, suggesting an interaction between syntactic and lexical processing. Specifically, the syntactic structure of utterances appears to be sensitive to the accessibility of lexical information, with phrases containing more accessible information occurring earlier in sentences. The existence of such an interaction argues that the utterance formulation system is not strictly hierarchical, as most current approaches to sentence production imply. A broad framework for models of production is outlined that incorporates these interactions within a limited-capacity processing system.

Rogers"", ""Karalyn Patterson""]","This paper begins with a brief description of a theoretical framework for semantic memory, in which processing is inherently sensitive to the varying typicality of its representations. The approach is then elaborated with particular regard to evidence from semantic dementia, a disorder resulting in relatively selective deterioration of conceptual knowledge, in which cognitive performance reveals ubiquitous effects of typicality. This applies to frankly semantic tasks (like object naming), where typicality can be gauged by the extent to which an object or concept is characterized by shared features in its category. It also applies in tasks apparently requiring only access to a 'surface' representation (such as lexical decision) or translation from one surface representation to another (like reading words aloud), where typicality is defined in terms of the structure of the surface domain(s). The effects of surface-domain typicality also appear early in the time course of word and object processing by normal participants, as revealed in event-related potential studies. These results suggest that perceptual and conceptual processing form an interactive continuum rather than distinct stages, and that typicality effects reign throughout this continuum.","what the patients still know is information that generalises to many different concepts (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007;Rogers & Patterson, 2007) -it seems plausible that lexico-syntactic information may be precisely the kind of abstracted, general, highly frequent information that should be preserved in SD.","['The canonical view of fluent and grammatically correct speech in SD is only partially supported by our results.', 'Whilst there was no evidence of gross syntactic violations, there was definitely an increased rate of errors on free and bound closed class items, and syntactic anomalies occurred when lexical retrieval went awry.', 'We end with the twin questions of why the syntax of SD speech might (a) be relatively preserved and (b) appear, on casual observation, to be even more normal than it actually is.', 'Syntax is abstracted information and it is likely to be redundantly coded (Bates & Wulfeck, 1989) as it applies across all members of a given class and across variations in other semantic content.', 'Given that the semantic deficit in SD is so strongly modulated by redundant coding -i.e.', 'what the patients still know is information that generalises to many different concepts (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007;Rogers & Patterson, 2007) -it seems plausible that lexico-syntactic information may be precisely the kind of abstracted, general, highly frequent information that should be preserved in SD.', 'Syntactic structures can be seen as highly routinised and automatically produced (Bates & Wulfeck, 1989;Kempler, Curtiss, & Jackson, 1987) and the processes that underpin their use in production have been constructively compared to implicit learning (Bock & Griffin, 2000;Chang, Dell, & Bock, 2006;Ferreira & Bock, 2006).']",4,"['what the patients still know is information that generalises to many different concepts (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007;Rogers & Patterson, 2007) -it seems plausible that lexico-syntactic information may be precisely the kind of abstracted, general, highly frequent information that should be preserved in SD.']"

Methods: Twenty patients with FTLD were classified as having FTD (N = 8) or SemD (N = 12) based on current clinical criteria. Both groups showed a similar spectrum of behavioral abnormalities, as indicated by the neuropsychiatric inventory. T1-weighted MRI was obtained for each patient and 20 control subjects. The regions of focal gray matter tissue loss associated with both FTD and SemD, as well as those differing between the two groups were examined using voxel-based morphometry. Results: Regions of significant atrophy seen in both groups were located in the ventromedial frontal cortex, the posterior orbital frontal regions bilaterally, the insula bilaterally, and the left anterior cingulate cortex. The FTD, but not the SemD, group showed atrophy in the right dorsolateral frontal cortex and the left premotor cortex. The SemD, but not the FTD, group showed tissue loss in the anterior temporal cortex and the amygdala/anterior hippocampal region bilaterally. Conclusions: Although FTD and SemD are associated with different overall patterns of brain atrophy, regions of gray matter tissue loss in the orbital frontal, insular, and anterior cingulate regions are present in both groups. The authors suggest that pathology in the areas of atrophy associated with both FTD and SemD may underlie some the behavioral symptoms seen in the two disorders.","SD is a subtype of Fronto-Temporal Dementia (FTD, Hodges & Patterson, 2007;Snowden, Neary, & Mann, 1996) in which there is relatively focal atrophy of the anterior inferior temporal lobe bilaterally, though often more severe on the left (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2002;Mummery et al., 2000;Galton et al., 2001;Seeley et al., 2005).","['There is a long tradition of using naturally-occurring speech errors to inform models of language production, under the assumption that such errors are constrained by components of linguistic processing (Bock & Levelt, 1994;Cutler, 1981;Fromkin, 1971).', 'One of the first models of speech production was based on an analysis of an extensive corpus of such errors in normal, healthy speakers (Garrett, 1984).', 'Speech errors produced by different aphasic patient groups have formed the basis of debates about particular deficits and how they relate to the intact language system (Bates & Wulfeck, 1989;Nickels & Howard, 2000;Rapp & Goldrick, 2000, Goldrick, 2006.', 'Here we present an analysis of naturallyoccurring speech errors in a group of patients with a diagnosis of semantic dementia (SD), a progressive neurological condition.', 'SD is a subtype of Fronto-Temporal Dementia (FTD, Hodges & Patterson, 2007;Snowden, Neary, & Mann, 1996) in which there is relatively focal atrophy of the anterior inferior temporal lobe bilaterally, though often more severe on the left (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2002;Mummery et al., 2000;Galton et al., 2001;Seeley et al., 2005).']",0,"['SD is a subtype of Fronto-Temporal Dementia (FTD, Hodges & Patterson, 2007;Snowden, Neary, & Mann, 1996) in which there is relatively focal atrophy of the anterior inferior temporal lobe bilaterally, though often more severe on the left (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2002;Mummery et al., 2000;Galton et al., 2001;Seeley et al., 2005).']"

Left temporal atrophy has been linked to loss of semantic knowledge, whereas behavioral symptoms dominate the right temporal variant. Objective: To investigate the first symptoms and the timing of subsequent symptoms in patients with left versus right tvFTD. Methods: Twenty-six patients with tvFTD were identified. Six had right > left temporal atrophy (right temporal lobe variant [RTLV]) and were matched with six having comparable left > right temporal atrophy (left temporal lobe variant [LTLV]). Clinical records were reviewed to generate individualized symptom chronologies. Results: In all patients, first symptoms involved semantics (4/6 LTLV, 1/6 RTLV), behavior (4/6 RTLV, 1/6 LTLV), or both (1 LTLV, 1 RTLV). Semantic loss began with anomia, word-finding difficulties, and repetitive speech, whereas the early behavioral syndrome was characterized by emotional distance, irritability, and disruption of physiologic drives (sleep, appetite, libido). After an average of 3 years, patients developed whichever of the two initial syndromes--semantic or behavioral--that they lacked at onset. A third stage, 5 to 7 years from onset, saw the emergence of disinhibition, compulsions, impaired face recognition, altered food preference, and weight gain. Compulsions in LTLV were directed toward visual, nonverbal stimuli, whereas patients with RTLV were drawn to games with words and symbols. Conclusions: The temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia follows a characteristic cognitive and behavioral progression that suggests early spread from one anterior temporal lobe to the other. Later symptoms implicate ventromedial frontal, insular, and inferoposterior temporal regions, but their precise anatomic correlates await confirmation.","SD is a subtype of Fronto-Temporal Dementia (FTD, Hodges & Patterson, 2007;Snowden, Neary, & Mann, 1996) in which there is relatively focal atrophy of the anterior inferior temporal lobe bilaterally, though often more severe on the left (Rosen et al., 2002;Mummery et al., 2000;Galton et al., 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005).","['There is a long tradition of using naturally-occurring speech errors to inform models of language production, under the assumption that such errors are constrained by components of linguistic processing (Bock & Levelt, 1994;Cutler, 1981;Fromkin, 1971).', 'One of the first models of speech production was based on an analysis of an extensive corpus of such errors in normal, healthy speakers (Garrett, 1984).', 'Speech errors produced by different aphasic patient groups have formed the basis of debates about particular deficits and how they relate to the intact language system (Bates & Wulfeck, 1989;Nickels & Howard, 2000;Rapp & Goldrick, 2000, Goldrick, 2006.', 'Here we present an analysis of naturallyoccurring speech errors in a group of patients with a diagnosis of semantic dementia (SD), a progressive neurological condition.', 'SD is a subtype of Fronto-Temporal Dementia (FTD, Hodges & Patterson, 2007;Snowden, Neary, & Mann, 1996) in which there is relatively focal atrophy of the anterior inferior temporal lobe bilaterally, though often more severe on the left (Rosen et al., 2002;Mummery et al., 2000;Galton et al., 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005).']",0,"['SD is a subtype of Fronto-Temporal Dementia (FTD, Hodges & Patterson, 2007;Snowden, Neary, & Mann, 1996) in which there is relatively focal atrophy of the anterior inferior temporal lobe bilaterally, though often more severe on the left (Rosen et al., 2002;Mummery et al., 2000;Galton et al., 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005).']"

Experiment 1 showed large advantages for spoken recall of concrete words that were independent of speech rate. Experiment 2 showed an equivalent effect with written, rather than spoken, recall.

Kathryn Bock""]","The grammatical relations of noun phrases in sentences are ordered in a hierar-chy that is reflected in a wide array of linguistic phenomena. The hypothesis explored in this paper is that this hierarchy is related to the conceptual accessi-bility of the intended referents of noun phrases that commonly occur in particu-lar relational roles, with relations higher in the hierarchy typically occupied by noun phrases representing more accessible concepts. An experiment on the formulation of sentences examined the relationship betweeen conceptual acces-sibility and grammatical relations for three levels in the hierarchy, the subject, direct object, and indirect object. There was a strong and systematic influence of conceptual accessibility on the surface syntactic structure of sentences. The attribution of this effect to grammatical role assignments, rather than to serial ordering mechanisms, was supported by the absence of an effect of conceptual accessibility on the order of nouns in conjunctive noun phrases. This pattern of results can be explained within current theories of sentence production. Converting thoughts into language requires that elements of the nonlinguistic conceptual system be mapped onto syntactic roles in sentences. In this paper we examine one aspect of this mapping process, arguing that an important factor in the assignment of conceptual elements to syntactic roles in the pro-duction of sentences is the ease of representing potential referents in thought, or their conceptual accessibility. An experiment provides evidence that con-ceptual accessibility is linked to a hierarchy of grammatical relations that influences sentence formulation.

A common answer to this question assumes that thematic roles help to mediate the mapping from messages to syntax. However, research using structural priming has suggested that the construction of syntactic frames may be insensitive to variations in thematic roles within messages (Cognition 35 (1990) 1; Psychological Review 99 (1992) 150). Because these studies involved structural alternations whose syntax covaries with the order of thematic roles, it is difficult to assess any independent contribution that role information may make to the positioning of phrases. In this study, we primed the order of the roles without changing the syntactic structure of the sentences produced, and found that the order of the roles was influenced by the priming manipulation.

We describe evidence suggesting that structural priming exhibits effects characteristic of both learning and implicitness.

This is the levels-of-processing hypothesis. The second claim is that these levels of processing are hierarchically organized, with no interaction between lower and higher levels.

Warrington""]","The selective impairment of semantic memory is described in three patients with diffuse cerebrallesions. These patients, selected on the basis of a failure to recognize or identify common objects (agnosia for objects), were investigated in detail. In particular, their perceptual, language and memory functions were assessed, and the limits and properties of their recognition difficulties explored. It was found that knowledge of pictorial representations of objects, and of words, was impaired or impoverished, and in both instances knowledge of subordinate categories was more vulnerable than superordinate categories. Evidence is presented that this impairment of semantic memory cannot be accounted for by intellectual impairment, sensory or perceptual deficits, or expressive language disorder. The implications of damage to the semantic memory system for the operation of other cognitive systems, in particular short and long-term memory functions, are considered. Some tentative evidence for the structural basis for a hierarchically organized modality-specific semantic memory system is discussed.","doi:10.1016/j.bandl.2009.03.007 general, with better preservation of typical, familiar and highly frequent information #AUTHOR_TAG, 1975).","['In sum, SD presents a remarkably focused deterioration in conceptual-semantic knowledge such that specific, distinctive information is lost and expressions of knowledge become increasingly 0093-934X/$ -see front matter �_ 2009 Elsevier Inc.', 'All rights reserved.', 'doi:10.1016/j.bandl.2009.03.007 general, with better preservation of typical, familiar and highly frequent information #AUTHOR_TAG, 1975).', 'Given these qualities, the syndrome provides a unique opportunity to explore how a degraded semantic system (and associated lexical deficits) affect speech production. 1 Most models of spoken language production share the assumption that there are three distinct levels of processing.', 'First is a level at which the pre-verbal message is generated and concepts are retrieved to express it (message generation).', 'Second, there is an intermediate level at which lexico-semantic representations (words) are selected to express the concepts (retrieval of open class items); it is also thought that syntactic information is retrieved at this point and sentence structure is generated (closed class items and morphology).', 'Third, phonological representations are retrieved that map onto the selected words (e.g.', 'Bock, 1999;Garrett, 1984;Goldrick, 2006;Levelt, Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999;Vigliocco & Kita, 2006).', 'At present, all models assume cascading of information (i.e.', 'partial information from one level can be accessed by the next) from conceptual to lexico-semantic representations, as this allows multiple candidates to be activated for a particular target (Goldrick, 2006;Levelt et al., 1999); interactivity between other levels is still a topic of much debate (Dell, 1986;Rapp & Goldrick, 2000;Roelofs, 2004;Vigliocco & Hartsuiker, 2002).']",0,"['In sum, SD presents a remarkably focused deterioration in conceptual-semantic knowledge such that specific, distinctive information is lost and expressions of knowledge become increasingly 0093-934X/$ -see front matter _ 2009 Elsevier Inc.', 'All rights reserved.', 'doi:10.1016/j.bandl.2009.03.007 general, with better preservation of typical, familiar and highly frequent information #AUTHOR_TAG, 1975).', 'Given these qualities, the syndrome provides a unique opportunity to explore how a degraded semantic system (and associated lexical deficits) affect speech production. 1 Most models of spoken language production share the assumption that there are three distinct levels of processing.']"

Neuroanatomical and diagnostic implications,"[""J Hodges""]","To establish whether semantic memory is consistently impaired in patients with very mild dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT), we assessed episodic and semantic memory in 52 patients with DAT who were divided into three sub-groups according to dementia severity on the Mini-Mental State Examination (minimal > 23, mild 17-23 and moderate < 17) and 24 matched controls. The minimal group showed impairment on the following semantic memory measures: category fluency, naming of line drawings, naming to verbal description, answering semantic feature questions and a non-verbal picture-picture matching task (the Pyramids and Palm Trees Test). The mild and moderate groups showed additional deficits on picture sorting and word-picture matching tests. Within the minimal and mild groups there was, however, considerable heterogeneity. While some patients showed a consistent impairment across all of the semantic memory tests, others were impaired on only on a subset of these tests and a few even performed flawlessly. In contrast, all patients showed a profound deficit in episodic memory: delayed recall of new verbal and non-verbal material appears to be a particularly sensitive marker of early DAT. These data are in keeping with recent neuropathological studies demonstrating that the transentorhinal region is consistently involved at a very early stage. Lesions in this site cause a functional disconnection of the hippocampus, and hence a profound episodic memory disorder. The fact that many, but not all, patients with early disease also show impairment of semantic memory suggests that damage to the transentorhinal region is not sufficient to produce significant disruption of semantic memory. Such disruption reliably occurs, we hypothesize, only when the pathology extends to the temporal neocortex proper.","Control test scores are taken from a separate sample of controls (#AUTHOR_TAG & Patterson, 1995).","['Seven patients with a clinical diagnosis of semantic dementia (SD) were recruited to take part in a study of autobiographical memory (Hornberger, Piguet, & Hodges, 2008).', 'One other patient (DV), who was too impaired to participate in the autobiographical memory study, had his free speech recorded before routine neuropsychological testing.', ""All patients were identified through the Memory and Cognitive Disorders Clinic or the Early Dementia Clinic at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK."", 'Their diagnosis was based on the cognitive and neuroradiological criteria outlined by Hodges, Patterson, Oxbury, and Funnell (1992).', 'Their mean age (at the time of completing the majority of neuropsychological tests) was 64.9 years (s.d.', '= 6.4), and they had spent an average of 13.6 years in formal education (s.d.', '= 3.2).', 'Eight control participants were selected from a set of fifteen recruited for the same autobiographical memory study; their mean age was 60.4 years (s.d.', '= 4.9) (t( 14) = 2.0 and p = 0.06) with an average of 15.6 years (s.d.', '= 3.2) in formal education (t( 14) = ��0.912 and p > 0.3).', 'Control participants were recruited from the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit volunteer panel.', 'For the patients, background information and test scores on standard neuropsychological tests are given in Table 1; the patients are assessed longitudinally and the scores in Table 1 are taken from the testing session closest in time to the interview/connected speech recording.', 'Control test scores are taken from a separate sample of controls (#AUTHOR_TAG & Patterson, 1995).', 'All participants were native speakers of British English.']",5,"['Seven patients with a clinical diagnosis of semantic dementia (SD) were recruited to take part in a study of autobiographical memory (Hornberger, Piguet, & Hodges, 2008).', 'One other patient (DV), who was too impaired to participate in the autobiographical memory study, had his free speech recorded before routine neuropsychological testing.', ""All patients were identified through the Memory and Cognitive Disorders Clinic or the Early Dementia Clinic at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK."", 'Their diagnosis was based on the cognitive and neuroradiological criteria outlined by Hodges, Patterson, Oxbury, and Funnell (1992).', 'Their mean age (at the time of completing the majority of neuropsychological tests) was 64.9 years (s.d.', 'Control test scores are taken from a separate sample of controls (#AUTHOR_TAG & Patterson, 1995).']"

The results are taken to indicate that syntactic ability is selectively preserved in AD. These findings are consistent with a modular theory of grammar and of mental functions more generally. A tentative explanation of these phenomena is proposed in which the overlearned and automatic nature of syntactic ability helps account for its resilience to cognitive dissolution and cortical degeneration.

Insufficient understanding of a customer's time orientation can lead to problems, such as attempting a relationship marketing when transaction marketing is more appropriate. The author suggests that long-term orientation in a buyer/seller relationship is a function of two main factors: mutual dependence and the extent to which they trust one another. Dependence and trust are related to environmental uncertainty, transaction-specific investments, reputation, and satisfaction in a buyer/seller relationship. The framework presented here is tested with 124 retail buyers and 52 vendors supplying to those retailers. The results indicate that trust and dependence play key roles in determining the long-term orientation of both retail buyers and their vendors. The results also indicate that both similarities and differences exist across retailers and vendors with respect to the effects of several variables on long-term orientation, dependence, and trust.","Andaleeb, 1996;Anderson & Weitz, 1992;#AUTHOR_TAG, 1994), later studies often highlight its duality.","['The literature on industrial marketing seems to agree that companies maintain relationships either because they have to or because they want to.', 'The commitment concept helps understand this duality in bonding rationales.', 'Commitment occupies a central role in the study of successful relationships between firms (Gilliland & Bello, 2002;Gundlach et al., 1995;Hunt et al., 2006;Morgan & Hunt, 1994).', 'While early research models commitment as a onedimensional construct (e.g.', 'Andaleeb, 1996;Anderson & Weitz, 1992;#AUTHOR_TAG, 1994), later studies often highlight its duality.', 'Bendapudi and Berry (1997) approach this dichotomy as ""dedication-based"" versus ""constraint-based"" relationship maintenance.', 'In other studies, ""affective commitment"" is the extent to which partners like to stay in existing relationships while ""calculative commitment"" is the degree to which they need to stay (de Ruyter et al., 2001;Geyskens et al., 1996).', 'Brown et al.

Relying on commitment theory, a model is developed that describes how attitudinal commitment may reside in either the instrumental or the social strain of a manufacturer's relationship with its distributor. For each strain, the developmental role played by key facets of the channel setting--relative dependence, pledges, and trust--are shown. Furthermore, the nature of the attachment bond is posited to motivate very different governance mechanisms as the distribution agreement is enforced by either social or contractual means. Empirical support for the model demonstrates that an expanded view of attitudinal commitment is important in understanding the complex nature of attachment in channel relationships.","The literature suggests that companies maintain relationship bonds either because ""they have to"", due to high switching costs, or because ""they want to"", because of high relationship value (Bendapudi & Berry, 1997;de Ruyter et al., 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG & Bello, 2002;Gounaris, 2005;Liu, 2006).","['Over the past two decades, research in business-to-business markets has increasingly focused on the study of buyer-seller relationships because relationships generate many benefits for organizations, e.g. in terms of increased performance, competitiveness, satisfaction, and innovation (Gummesson, 2004;Lindgreen & Wynstra, 2005;Ravald & Gr�_nroos, 1996;Sharma et al., 1999).', 'A buyer-seller relationship can be defined as a non-accidental sequence of market transactions between independent market actors (Kleinaltenkamp & Ehret, 2006).', 'The literature suggests that companies maintain relationship bonds either because ""they have to"", due to high switching costs, or because ""they want to"", because of high relationship value (Bendapudi & Berry, 1997;de Ruyter et al., 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG & Bello, 2002;Gounaris, 2005;Liu, 2006).', ""So far, there is little empirical evidence about the consequences of these two motives on companies' behavioral intentions in relationships."", 'In well-functioning relationships, buyers and sellers not only show lower tendencies to search for and switch to alternative partners but are also expected to intensify their relationships and even temporarily tolerate disadvantages of being in business together (Anderson & Weitz, 1992;Bendapudi & Berry, 1997;Gounaris, 2005).', 'Because there are many benefits at stake in business relationships, it is central for companies to better understand what influences the intentions of their partners.']",0,"['Over the past two decades, research in business-to-business markets has increasingly focused on the study of buyer-seller relationships because relationships generate many benefits for organizations, e.g. in terms of increased performance, competitiveness, satisfaction, and innovation (Gummesson, 2004;Lindgreen & Wynstra, 2005;Ravald & Gr_nroos, 1996;Sharma et al., 1999).', 'A buyer-seller relationship can be defined as a non-accidental sequence of market transactions between independent market actors (Kleinaltenkamp & Ehret, 2006).', 'The literature suggests that companies maintain relationship bonds either because ""they have to"", due to high switching costs, or because ""they want to"", because of high relationship value (Bendapudi & Berry, 1997;de Ruyter et al., 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG & Bello, 2002;Gounaris, 2005;Liu, 2006).', ""So far, there is little empirical evidence about the consequences of these two motives on companies' behavioral intentions in relationships."", 'In well-functioning relationships, buyers and sellers not only show lower tendencies to search for and switch to alternative partners but are also expected to intensify their relationships and even temporarily tolerate disadvantages of being in business together (Anderson & Weitz, 1992;Bendapudi & Berry, 1997;Gounaris, 2005).', 'Because there are many benefits at stake in business relationships, it is central for companies to better understand what influences the intentions of their partners.']"

Further, and contrary to common assertion, the risk of making a Type II error can be substantial even when the sample size is large.

Then this seminal research and more recent research are categorized according to two distinct levels of analysis: the value of goods and services versus the value of buyerÐsupplier relationships, and different understandings of the role of business marketing and purchasing and supply are discussed.

Firms, Markets, Relational Contracting","[""Oliver E. Williamson""]","This study is based on the belief that economic organization is shaped by transaction cost economizing decisions. It sets out the basic principles of transaction cost economics, applies the basic arguments to economic institutions, and develops public policy implications. Any issue that arises, or can be recast as a matter of contracting, is usefully examined in terms of transaction costs. Transaction cost economics maintains that governance of contractual relations is mainly achieved through institutions of private ordering instead of legal centralism. This approach is based on behavioral assumptions of bounded rationalism and opportunism, which reflect actual human nature. These assumptions underlie the problem of economic organization: to create contract and governance structures that economize on bounded rationality while safeguarding transactions against the hazards of opportunism. The book first summarizes the transaction cost economics approach to the study of economic organization. It develops the underlying behavioral assumptions and the types of transactions; alternative approaches to the world of contracts are presented. Assuming that firms are best regarded as a governance structure, a comparative institutional approach to the governance of contractual relations is set out. The evidence, theory, and policy of vertical integration are discussed, on the basis that the decision to integrate is paradigmatic to transaction cost analysis. The incentives and bureaucratic limits of internal organization are presented, including the dilemma of why a large firm can't do everything a collection of small firms can do. The economics of organization in presented in terms of transaction costs, showing that hierarchy also serves efficiency and permits a variety of predictions about the organization of work. Efficient labor organization is explored; on the assumption that an authority relation prevails between workers and managers, what governance structure supports will be made in response to various types of job attributes are discussed, and implications for union organization are developed. Considering antitrust ramifications of transaction cost economics, the book summarizes transaction cost issues that arise in the context of contracting, merger, and strategic behavior, and challenges earlier antitrust preoccupation with monopoly.

It argues that the transaction cost perspective has at least two major limitations when used to analyse interorganizational strategies: (1) a single_party, cost minimization emphasis that neglects the interdependence between exchange partners in the pursuit of joint value, and (2) an over_emphasis on the structural features of interorganizational exchange that neglects important process issues. We propose instead a transactional value framework for analysing interorganizational strategies that addresses (1) joint value maximization, and (2) the processes by which exchange partners create and claim value.

A longitudinal study verifies that the positive effect of salesperson-owned loyalty on sales growth persists over time. However, because salesperson-owned loyalty simultaneously increases the seller's risk of losing business if the salesperson defects to a competitor, managers need to manage effectively the benefit-risk trade-off. Increasing relationship-enhancing activities and value received by the customer builds both salesperson-owned loyalty and loyalty to the selling firm.

Tallman""]","This paper offers a theoretical explanation for why interfirm collaborations form yet fail, and further suggests how firms might manage them for a more positive outcome. Based on a perspective of value, we explain how a more inclusive and integrative perspective, one which combines elements from transaction costs and resource-based theory, provides more robust insight into collaboration formation, management, and instability. In doing so, we differentiate rent-yielding firm-specific assets at the core of the resource-based view from the transaction-specific assets at the core of transaction cost theory. The paper makes a crucial distinction between the potential value attainable through collaborations and its actual realization. The crux of our argument is that firms enter into collaborative relationships because these are expected to yield superior value relative to alternate organizational forms in certain situations, offering potentially synergistic combinations of complementary resources and capabilities, yet such relationships are frequently prone to failure because the partner firms tend not to recognize ex ante the nature and extent of transaction-specific investment that is required in the collaborative relationship to attain these synergies. In our argument, critically, the relationship between organizations is seen not simply as a governance structure of a hybrid nature but, more importantly, as a productive resource for value creation and realization. In this light, transaction-specific investment in what we term relational specificity becomes imperative. In the search for value, we explain why the transaction costs incurred in the exchange of resources are not independent of the nature of resources to be transacted and, similarly, why the returns realized from these resources are not independent of the relationship- and transaction-specific expenditures incurred in effectively combining them and maintaining the combination. The interdependence between the two, mediated by the quality of the relationship, has direct implications for the earning of rents through collaborations. These relationship-specific expenditures can be of an internally generated nature, endogenous to the alliance form itself, and need not exceed alternative forms, while the associated benefits have the capacity to potentially exceed the alternatives. This translates into potentially superior value. The paper contributes in three key related ways: (a) the explicit recognition of the relationship as a value-bearing asset embedded in a larger and endogenous institutional context, namely a system of resource relationships-both intraorganizational and inter-organizational-among partner firms and the collaboration, (b) the recognition of the evolving relationship between production and exchange which, at the level of the collaboration, is directly dependent on the nature, evolution, and dynamics of the relationship among the parties to the transaction, and (c) the provision of a nontrust explanation for why firms might knowingly forego opportunities to take advantage of their partners. Drawing from this, the paper occasions (a) a shift in focus from the form to the process of governance, which has direct implications for value creation and realization and (b) a shift in the primary identity of transaction-specific and relationship-specific expenditures from cost to investment in future value.","Anderson, 1995;Ghosh & John, 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG & Tallman, 1998;Zajac & Olsen, 1993), others see TCA as a starting point for analyzing value creation between exchange partners.","['While many authors criticize TCA for failing to recognize that value creation rather than minimizing costs is the primary goal of business exchange (e.g.', 'Anderson, 1995;Ghosh & John, 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG & Tallman, 1998;Zajac & Olsen, 1993), others see TCA as a starting point for analyzing value creation between exchange partners.', 'Kleinaltenkamp and Ehret (2006) position specific investments as a source of switching costs but also as an important source of value creation.', 'Indeed, productivity advantages of specific investments become apparent when the original TCA assumption ""output is held constant"" (Williamson, 1985, p.85) is given up (Kim, 1999;Kleinaltenkamp & Ehret, 2006).', 'Since specific investments are particular to the focal relationship, the associated gain referred to as ""quasirent"" can only be realized between the involved parties (Backhaus & B�_schken, 1999).', 'By making specific investments for a customer, a supplier can help this particular customer in developing more efficient operations or in better differentiating its market offerings (Ghosh & John, 1999).', ""Consequently, the creation of superior value increases the customer's willingness to pay for the supplier's offerings which results, in turn, in a higher customer lifetime value for the supplier."", 'The same applies in converse when a customer specifically invests in a supplier.']",0,"['Anderson, 1995;Ghosh & John, 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG & Tallman, 1998;Zajac & Olsen, 1993), others see TCA as a starting point for analyzing value creation between exchange partners.']"

Liu""]","Purpose Ð The purpose of this study is to examine the concept of customer value and its role in building switching costs perceptions. The current research develops scales and empirically validates a typology of customer value for business services. Design/methodolgy/approach Ð Through an extensive literature review, qualitative interviews, and an empirical investigation, the current study identifies three facets of customer value for business services (i.e. economic value, relational value, and core value) and investigates their relationships with buyers' perceptions of switching costs. Structural equation modeling techniques were used to evaluate a measurement model and structural relationships. Findings Ð The findings show that economic value and the value obtained from relational and support aspects of a service exert strong positive impact on customers' perceptions of switching costs and thus serve as barriers to exit. Although core service does not seem to have positive impact on switching costs, core value maybe a ÒhygieneÓ factor that may promote customers' switching if not properly managed. Research limitations/implications Ð The results of this study are generated from a single industry; additional studies in other industries may strengthen the generalizability of the proposed constructs and framework. Practical implications Ð Business suppliers need to build exit barriers through co-creating relational value. Through communications, suppliers may be able to monitor customers' desired value as a proactive action to anticipate changes and to influence positive changes in customer value. Originality/value Ð The current study sheds some light on how supplier firms can enhance switching costs, and consequently raise exit barriers by better managing various aspects of customer value perceptions.","The literature suggests that companies maintain relationship bonds either because ""they have to"", due to high switching costs, or because ""they want to"", because of high relationship value (Bendapudi & Berry, 1997;de Ruyter et al., 2001;Gilliland & Bello, 2002;Gounaris, 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2006).","['Over the past two decades, research in business-to-business markets has increasingly focused on the study of buyer-seller relationships because relationships generate many benefits for organizations, e.g. in terms of increased performance, competitiveness, satisfaction, and innovation (Gummesson, 2004;Lindgreen & Wynstra, 2005;Ravald & Gr�_nroos, 1996;Sharma et al., 1999).', 'A buyer-seller relationship can be defined as a non-accidental sequence of market transactions between independent market actors (Kleinaltenkamp & Ehret, 2006).', 'The literature suggests that companies maintain relationship bonds either because ""they have to"", due to high switching costs, or because ""they want to"", because of high relationship value (Bendapudi & Berry, 1997;de Ruyter et al., 2001;Gilliland & Bello, 2002;Gounaris, 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2006).', ""So far, there is little empirical evidence about the consequences of these two motives on companies' behavioral intentions in relationships."", 'In well-functioning relationships, buyers and sellers not only show lower tendencies to search for and switch to alternative partners but are also expected to intensify their relationships and even temporarily tolerate disadvantages of being in business together (Anderson & Weitz, 1992;Bendapudi & Berry, 1997;Gounaris, 2005).', 'Because there are many benefits at stake in business relationships, it is central for companies to better understand what influences the intentions of their partners.']",1,"['Over the past two decades, research in business-to-business markets has increasingly focused on the study of buyer-seller relationships because relationships generate many benefits for organizations, e.g. in terms of increased performance, competitiveness, satisfaction, and innovation (Gummesson, 2004;Lindgreen & Wynstra, 2005;Ravald & Gr_nroos, 1996;Sharma et al., 1999).', 'The literature suggests that companies maintain relationship bonds either because ""they have to"", due to high switching costs, or because ""they want to"", because of high relationship value (Bendapudi & Berry, 1997;de Ruyter et al., 2001;Gilliland & Bello, 2002;Gounaris, 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2006).']"

The two studies are then compared using invariance testing in order to determine economic and relational factors that drive satisfaction and performance from each party's perspective. Results show that collaborative activities, such as information sharing, joint relationship effort, and dedicated investments lead to trust and commitment.

Palmatier""]","This article integrates social network and exchange theory to develop a model of customer value based on three relational drivers: relationship quality (the caliber of relational ties), contact density (the number of relational ties), and contact authority (the decision-making capability of relational contacts). The results suggest that the value generated from interfirm relationships derives not only from the quality of customer ties (e.g., trust, commitment, norms), as is typically modeled, but also from the number and decision-making capability of interfirm contacts and the interactions among relational drivers. Moderator analysis of customer characteristics suggests that increasing contact density benefits sellers that have customers with high employee turnover rates, whereas building relationships with key decisions makers generates the highest returns among customers that are more difficult to access. The conceptual model of the impact of interfirm relational drivers on customer value receives support from dyadic data across 446 business-to-business exchanges.","In this situation of concrete object and attributes, there do not appear to be disadvantages (Bergkvist & Rossiter, 2007): in fact, it is preferable to use single items, as do Bolton et al.

The assessment was based on the analysis of the statistical relationship between customer loyalty and customer value within the Finnish market of the case company.    The feasibility was assessed in the context of common statements associated with relationship marketing. Primarily, these statements conclude that companies should strive to increase the loyalty of their customers due to increasingly competitive market environments. For companies, the ability to create superior value to customers by forging stronger relationships with them is not only considered a perquisite for survival, but also as a way to increase profitability.    The validity of these statements was tested, and the results were used as a basis for evaluating whether increased customer loyalty increases with customer value within the Finnish market of the case company.    This study was implemented as a quantitative research by using RFM-analysis to evaluate Finnish customers based on two variables; value and loyalty. The evaluation was done based on sales data from 2015 and 2016. Because of the sensitiveness of the information, the collected customer data is not published.    The results indicate that an overall positive statistical relationship between value and loyalty exists. However, due to the limitations of the research methodology, the argument that increased customer loyalty will lead to greater customer value cannot be researched to the full extent.

The author suggests that relational exchange involves both an attitudinal and a behavioral shift and maintains that joint action, a behavioral element of relational exchange, is driven not only by economizing motives to save transaction cost, but also by strategizing motives to serve customer needs better than competitors do. In particular, specialized investment is proposed as a common motive that has both economizing and strategizing aspects. Results of the hypothesis tests based on the survey of industrial distributors suggest that both economizing considerations and strategizing considerations motivate joint action in marketing channels. The dual motives of specialized investment are also supported.

Many firms that are frustrated in their efforts to improve quality and customer satisfaction are beginning to question the link between customer satisfaction and economic returns. The authors investigate the nature and strength of this link. They discuss how expectations, quality, and price should affect customer satisfaction and why customer satisfaction, in turn, should affect profitability; this results in a set of hypotheses that are tested using a national customer satisfaction index and traditional accounting measures of economic returns, such as return on investment. The findings support a positive impact of quality on customer satisfaction, and, in turn, profitability. The authors demonstrate the economic benefits of increasing customer satisfaction using both an empirical forecast and a new analytical model. In addition, they discuss why increasing market share actually might lead to lower customer satisfaction and provide preliminary empirical support for this hypothesis. Finally, two new findings emerge: First, the market's expectations of the quality of a firm's output positively affects customersÕ overall satisfaction with the firm; and second, these expectations are largely rational, albeit with a small adaptive component.","Overall, interfirm cooperation in buyer-seller relationships is associated with a number of positive economic and non-economic outcomes (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1994;Geyskens et al., 1999).","['shows positive correlations between the long-term orientation of relationships with the anticipated and actual performance of interdependent members within a distribution channel.', 'Overall, interfirm cooperation in buyer-seller relationships is associated with a number of positive economic and non-economic outcomes (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1994;Geyskens et al., 1999).']",4,"['shows positive correlations between the long-term orientation of relationships with the anticipated and actual performance of interdependent members within a distribution channel.', 'Overall, interfirm cooperation in buyer-seller relationships is associated with a number of positive economic and non-economic outcomes (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1994;Geyskens et al., 1999).']"

Emerson""]","The kinetic power of radio jets is a quantity of fundamental importance to studies of the AGN feedback process and radio galaxy physics. A widely used proxy for jet power is the extended radio luminosity. A number of empirical methods have been used to calibrate a scaling relationship between jet power (Q) and radio luminosity (L) of the form log(Q) = beta_L * log(L) + C. The regression slope has typically been found to be beta_L ~ 0.7 - 0.8. Here we show that the previously reported scaling relations are strongly affected by the confounding variable, distance. We find that in a sample of FRI X-ray cavity systems, after accounting for the mutual distance dependence, the jet power and radio luminosity are only weakly correlated, with slope beta_L ~ 0.3: significantly flatter than previously reported. We also find that in previously used samples of high-power sources, no evidence for an intrinsic correlation is present when the effect of distance is accounted for. Using a simple model we show that beta_L is expected to be significantly lower in samples of FRI radio galaxies than it is for FRIIs, due to the differing dynamics for these two classes of radio source. For FRI X-ray cavity systems the model predicts beta_L (FRI) ~ 0.5 in contrast to FRII radio galaxies, for which beta_L(FRII) ~ 0.8. We discuss the implications of our finding for studies of radio mode feedback, and radio galaxy physics.Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

When customer commitment is based on switching costs and dependence, it has mixed effects on customer loyalty. In addition, it was found that there were significant interactions between these two forms of commitment on customer loyalty.

Marketing managers and researchers have identified mutual commitment among exchange partners in a marketing channel as central to successful relationship marketing and as key to producing significant benefits for firms. We consider two types of commitment that may characterize interfirm relationships. Affective commitment expresses the extent to which channel members like to maintain their relationship with specific partners. Calculative commitment measures the degree to which channel members experience the need to maintain a relationship. After conceptualizing commitment, we offer a set of hypotheses concerning the joint impact of trust and interdependence on both affective and calculative commitment. Testing our hypotheses in a field study involving two countries, we find strong evidence that total interdependence enhances both affective and calculative commitment.

Based on transaction cost economics and relational exchange theory, we discuss key constructs describing long-term relationships and develop hypotheses that can explain differences between long-term and short-term relationships. By using longitudinal data from relationships between Norwegian exporters of farmed salmon and importers in the United States and Japan, we empirically test the relationship duration hypotheses. Our results indicate that relational investments are positively associated with relationship duration; whereas, hierarchical governance mechanisms are negatively associated with relationship duration. Furthermore, the results suggest that governance by relational norms is an important element in designing durable relationships.","These can be consciously-made specific investments into physical or site-specific assets (Handfield & Bechtel, 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG, 1999;Heide, 1994) or can be unconsciously developed relationship-specific assets like workforce skills (S�_llner, 1999) or trust in the partner.","['In buyer-seller relationships some assets possess value in only this focal relationship and thus require relationship-specific investments.', 'These can be consciously-made specific investments into physical or site-specific assets (Handfield & Bechtel, 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG, 1999;Heide, 1994) or can be unconsciously developed relationship-specific assets like workforce skills (S�_llner, 1999) or trust in the partner.', 'Dissolution of the current relationship necessitates actors investing in new relationship-specific assets in new relationships.', ""These investments together with relationship termination costs and search costs for new partners represent an economic actor's switching costs (Bendapudi & Berry, 1997)."", 'They tend to force partners to stay within buyer-seller relationships as the ""have to"" bonding mechanism.']",1,"['In buyer-seller relationships some assets possess value in only this focal relationship and thus require relationship-specific investments.', 'These can be consciously-made specific investments into physical or site-specific assets (Handfield & Bechtel, 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG, 1999;Heide, 1994) or can be unconsciously developed relationship-specific assets like workforce skills (S�_llner, 1999) or trust in the partner.', 'Dissolution of the current relationship necessitates actors investing in new relationship-specific assets in new relationships.', ""These investments together with relationship termination costs and search costs for new partners represent an economic actor's switching costs (Bendapudi & Berry, 1997)."", 'They tend to force partners to stay within buyer-seller relationships as the ""have to"" bonding mechanism.']"

We present a model suggesting that to build relationships based on trust, suppliers must invest in site-specific and human assets, and buyers must judiciously apply contracts to control for relative levels of dependence within the relationship. Our model also suggests that buyer-dependence, supplier human asset investments, and trust are all positively associated with improved supply chain responsiveness, defined in this study as the supplier's ability to quickly respond to the buying party's needs. This model is tested with data gathered from a sample of purchasing managers in North American manufacturing firms. The results suggest that even in cases when buyers do not have a great deal of control over their suppliers, working to build trust within the relationship can improve supplier responsiveness.","These can be consciously-made specific investments into physical or site-specific assets (#AUTHOR_TAG & Bechtel, 2002;Haugland, 1999;Heide, 1994) or can be unconsciously developed relationship-specific assets like workforce skills (S�_llner, 1999) or trust in the partner.","['In buyer-seller relationships some assets possess value in only this focal relationship and thus require relationship-specific investments.', 'These can be consciously-made specific investments into physical or site-specific assets (#AUTHOR_TAG & Bechtel, 2002;Haugland, 1999;Heide, 1994) or can be unconsciously developed relationship-specific assets like workforce skills (S�_llner, 1999) or trust in the partner.', 'Dissolution of the current relationship necessitates actors investing in new relationship-specific assets in new relationships.', ""These investments together with relationship termination costs and search costs for new partners represent an economic actor's switching costs (Bendapudi & Berry, 1997)."", 'They tend to force partners to stay within buyer-seller relationships as the ""have to"" bonding mechanism.']",1,"['In buyer-seller relationships some assets possess value in only this focal relationship and thus require relationship-specific investments.', 'These can be consciously-made specific investments into physical or site-specific assets (#AUTHOR_TAG & Bechtel, 2002;Haugland, 1999;Heide, 1994) or can be unconsciously developed relationship-specific assets like workforce skills (S�_llner, 1999) or trust in the partner.']"

The analyses are based on a database of c. 7500 records of plant taxa from 250 sites dated to the early Neolithic of the region in which they occur, aggregated into a number of regional groups. The analysis demonstrates that a phylogenetic signal exists in the data but it is complicated by the fact that in comparison with the changes that occurred when the crop agriculture complex expanded out of the Near East, once it arrived in Europe it underwent only limited further changes. On the basis of the analysis it has been possible to identify the species losses and gains that occurred as the complex of crops and associated weeds spread and to show the influence of geographical location and cultural affinity on the pattern of losses and gains. This has led to consideration of the processes producing that history, including some reasons why the dispersal process did not produce a perfect tree phylogeny, as well as to the identification of some specific anomalies, such as the unusual nature of the Bulgarian pattern, which raise further questions for the future. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Eerkens"", ""Carl P. Lipo""]","Cultural transmission (CT) is implicit in many explanations of culture change. Formal CT models were defined by anthropologists 30 years ago and have been a subject of active research in the social sciences in the ensuing years. Although increasing in popularity in recent years, CT has not seen extensive use in archaeological research, despite the quantitative rigor of many CT models and the ability to create testable hypotheses. Part of the reason for the slow adoption, we argue, has been the continuing focus on change in central tendency and mode in archaeology, instead of change in dispersion or variance. Yet archaeological research provides an excellent data source for exploring processes of CT. We review CT research in the anthropological sciences and outline the benefits and drawbacks of this theoretical framework for the study of material culture. We argue that CT can shed much light on our understandings of why material technology changes over time, including explanations of differential rates of change among different technologies. We further argue that transmission processes are greatly affected by the content, context, and mode of transmission and fundamentally structure variation in material culture. Including ideas from CT can provide greater context for explaining and understanding changes in the variation of artifacts over time. Finally, we outline what we feel should be the goals of CT research in archaeology in the coming years.","These mechanisms form the theoretical foundation for what follows and, given the complexities involved, it is important to spell them out (see also #AUTHOR_TAG & Lipo 2007).","['In the case of culture, the inheritance mechanism is social learning: People learn ways to think and act from others.', 'Of course, the routes through which culture is inherited are much more diverse than those for genes (Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman 1981), and different routes have different consequences for the patterning of cultural change through time.', 'Variation in what is inherited is generated by innovations.', 'These may be unintended copying errors, but they can also be intentional changes, perhaps arising from trial-and-error experimentation, that lead an individual to stop doing what they had previously learned and to start doing it differently, or even to do something different altogether.', 'Whether this will be widely adopted depends on a range of selection and bias mechanisms, many of which have no equivalent in genetic evolution but whose existence and importance have formed the subject of major developments in the theory of cultural evolution over the past 30 years (especially Boyd & Richerson 1985, Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman 1981.', 'These mechanisms form the theoretical foundation for what follows and, given the complexities involved, it is important to spell them out (see also #AUTHOR_TAG & Lipo 2007).']",1,"['In the case of culture, the inheritance mechanism is social learning: People learn ways to think and act from others.', 'Of course, the routes through which culture is inherited are much more diverse than those for genes (Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman 1981), and different routes have different consequences for the patterning of cultural change through time.', 'Variation in what is inherited is generated by innovations.', 'These mechanisms form the theoretical foundation for what follows and, given the complexities involved, it is important to spell them out (see also #AUTHOR_TAG & Lipo 2007).']"

Renee Barlow""]","Variation in the costs and benefits of maize agriculture relative to local foraging opportunities structured variation in the relative intensity of agricultural strategies pursued by prehistoric peoples in the American Southwest. The material remains of Fremont farmers and horticulturists, long identified as the ""northern periphery"" of Southwestern archaeological traditions, are examined as a case representing extreme intersite variation in the economic importance of farming. New data quantifying the energetic gains associated with maize agriculture in Latin America are compared to caloric return rates for hunting and collecting indigenous foods. These data suggest that prehistoric maize farming was economically comparable to many local wild plants, but that intensive farming practices were most similar to very low-ranked seeds. The model predicts a continuum of pre-historic strategies that included horticulture within a system of indigenous resource collection and high residential mobility at one end, and at the other sedentary farmers heavily invested in agricultural activities with residences maintained near fields during a significant portion of the growing season. Differences in agricultural strategies should have been strongly influenced by the effects of local ecology on the marginal gains for time spent in maize fields and the abundance of key, high-ranked wild foods, not harvest yields per se. Increasing agricultural investments are expected with decreasing opportunities to collect higher-ranked foods, while decreases in time spent farming are expected only with increases in alternative economic opportunities.","Resource ranks may be assessed on the basis of experimental or ethnographic work in the present (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG 2002, Kaplan & Hill 1992.","['Over the past 20 years, optimal foraging theory (OFT) has been the basis of numerous studies.', 'Researchers usually assume that people are seeking to maximize their rate of calorific intake when they are engaged in food-getting activities, on the further assumption that, other things being equal, natural selection will favor those individuals that are most efficient.', 'The diet breadth model postulates that an individual will make the choice whether to exploit a particular encountered resource by determining whether the postencounter returns obtained after pursuing (if necessary) and processing it into a form in which it can be eaten will be greater than those to be obtained by ignoring that resource and looking for something better.', 'Thus, resources can be ranked in terms of their postencounter returns.', 'Highly ranked resources will always be taken on encounter, but lower ranked ones will be ignored.', 'This principle is important and, in some respects, counterintuitive.', 'Whether a resource is exploited does not depend on its own abundance but on that of the resources ranked higher than it.', 'Resource ranks may be assessed on the basis of experimental or ethnographic work in the present (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG 2002, Kaplan & Hill 1992.', 'In terms of archaeological evidence, significant taphonomic and sampling issues potentially arise, but assuming that these can be overcome, faunal assemblages, for example, can be evaluated in terms of some measure of their likely productivity or resource rank.', 'Because animal body size is correlated with handling costs and is readily assessable using archaeological faunal data, the proportion of large-bodied vs. small-bodied animal bones has very frequently been used as a diet-breadth measure (e.g., Broughton 1994; see also Ugan 2005; for within-species size variation see, e.g., Mannino & Thomas 2002).', 'Stiner and colleagues (2000) have used the proportions of slow-moving vs. fast-moving (and therefore hard to catch) small game as a diet breadth measure in their studies of faunal exploitation in the east Mediterranean later Palaeolithic.', 'Despite its simplicity, the diet breadth model has been remarkably successful in accounting for variation in faunal assemblages, especially in the context of diachronic sequences showing resource depression (e.g., Broughton 1997, Butler 2000.']",0,"['Over the past 20 years, optimal foraging theory (OFT) has been the basis of numerous studies.', 'Researchers usually assume that people are seeking to maximize their rate of calorific intake when they are engaged in food-getting activities, on the further assumption that, other things being equal, natural selection will favor those individuals that are most efficient.', 'The diet breadth model postulates that an individual will make the choice whether to exploit a particular encountered resource by determining whether the postencounter returns obtained after pursuing (if necessary) and processing it into a form in which it can be eaten will be greater than those to be obtained by ignoring that resource and looking for something better.', 'Resource ranks may be assessed on the basis of experimental or ethnographic work in the present (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG 2002, Kaplan & Hill 1992.', 'In terms of archaeological evidence, significant taphonomic and sampling issues potentially arise, but assuming that these can be overcome, faunal assemblages, for example, can be evaluated in terms of some measure of their likely productivity or resource rank.', 'Because animal body size is correlated with handling costs and is readily assessable using archaeological faunal data, the proportion of large-bodied vs. small-bodied animal bones has very frequently been used as a diet-breadth measure (e.g., Broughton 1994; see also Ugan 2005; for within-species size variation see, e.g., Mannino & Thomas 2002).', 'Stiner and colleagues (2000) have used the proportions of slow-moving vs. fast-moving (and therefore hard to catch) small game as a diet breadth measure in their studies of faunal exploitation in the east Mediterranean later Palaeolithic.', 'Despite its simplicity, the diet breadth model has been remarkably successful in accounting for variation in faunal assemblages, especially in the context of diachronic sequences showing resource depression (e.g., Broughton 1997, Butler 2000.']"

The Ideal Free Distribution, Food Production, and the Colonization of Oceania","[""Douglas Kennett"", ""Atholl Anderson"", ""Bruce Winterhalder""]","Author(s): Kennett, DJ; Anderson, A; Winterhalder, B | Editor(s): Kennett, Douglas J; Winterhalder, Bruce | Abstract: Islands in Oceania were some of the last habitable land masses on earth to be colonized by humans. Current archaeological evidence suggests that these islands were colonized episodically rather than continuously, and that bursts of migration were followed by longer periods of sedentism and population growth. The decision to colonize isolated, unoccupied islands and archipelagos was complex and dependent on a variety of social, technological and environmental variables. In this chapter we develop an integrative, multivariate approach to island colonization in Oceania based on a model from behavioral ecology known as the Ideal Free Distribution. This ecological model provides a framework that considers the dynamic character of island suitability along with density-dependent and density-independent variables influencing migratory behavior. Unique among existing models, it can account for the episodic nature of certain aspects of the colonization process. Within this context we critically evaluate the role of foraging, lowlevel food production, and ultimately intensive food production, as important contextual variables that influenced decisions to disperse. We argue that intensive food production was one variable that contributed to decreasing suitability of island habitats, stimulating dispersal, and ultimately migrations to more distant islands in Oceania.

CC1600,1683841,Evolution in Archaeology,Stephen Shennan,Declines in mammalian foraging efficiency during the late Holocene,"[""R Boyd"", ""M Borgerhoff-Mulder"", ""W H Durham"", ""Pj ; P Richerson"", "" Weingart"", "" Mitchell"", "" Pj Richerson"", "" Maasen""]","Resource intensification models that have been posited for prehistoric California predict decreases in foraging efficiency during the late Holocene, Using implications of the fine-grained prey model of optimal foraging theory, I derive an index of the efficiency of vertebrate prey choice from the relative abundances of large- and small-sized prey items. I then test the intensification models with late Holocene mammalian faunas from San Francisco Bay shellmounds. Dramatic linear decreases in the relalive frequency of artiodactyls compared to the smaller sea otters (Enhydra lutris) throughout the occupational histories of particular localities strongly support the resource intensification models. The declines in artiodactyl abundances are not correlated with late Holocene climatic indices developed for this region, with changes in the seasonal use of shellmounds, or with technological innovations. An intra- and interregionally consistent pattern in declining abundances of large mammals in environmentally distinct regions throughout California suggests that resource depression driven by human predators may be the single most important cause of the declines. These patterns have far-reaching implications concerning the long-term human role in structuring prehistoric ecosystems.","Moreover, not all the traits that characterize a complex object or entity will have had a common history (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1997).","[""These methods are based on the assumption of branching evolution from a single origin;
