An important influence here has been Paul Connerton's 1989 book, How Societies Remember. #AUTHOR_TAG  (1989: 21-25) begins by analysing memory claims in general by dividing them into three broad classes. Firstly, there are personal memory claims, memories which 'take as their object one's life history ' (1989: 22).

The study of emotion in archaeology has been discussed in an influential paper by #AUTHOR_TAG  (2000).

Certainly it would be rash to assume that emotions are experienced in exactly the same way in all cultures around death, or even that it would be appropriate to categorise these emotions as equivalent to our concept of 'grief'.
