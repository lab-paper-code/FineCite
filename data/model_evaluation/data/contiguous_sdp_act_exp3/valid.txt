CC1948	2193860	Structural investigation of LaAlO 3 up to 63 GPa	Mael Guennou	Pressure as a probe of the physics of ABO[sub 3] relaxor ferroelectrics	"[""G. A. Samara""]"	Results on a variety of mixed ABO{sub 3} oxides have revealed a pressure-induced ferroelectric-to-relaxor crossover and the continuous evolution of the energetics and dynamics of the relaxation process with increasing pressure. These common features have suggested a mechanism for the crossover phenomenon in terms of a large decrease in the correlation length for dipolar interactions with pressure--a unique property of soft mode or highly polarizable host lattices. The pressure effects as well as the interplay between pressure and dc biasing fields are illustrated for some recent results on PZN-9.5 PT,PMN and PLZT 6/65/35	"One of the attracting properties of the external parameter high-pressure is its character of a ""cleaner"" variable, since it acts only on interatomic distances #AUTHOR_TAG."

CC1501	14579	THE RELATION BETWEEN CONTENT AND STRUCTURE IN LANGUAGE PRODUCTION: AN ANALYSIS OF SPEECH ERRORS IN SEMANTIC DEMENTIA	Lotte Meteyard	The Rise and Fall of Frequency and Imageability: Noun and Verb Production in Semantic Dementia	"[""Helen Bird"", ""Matthew A. Lambon Ralph"", ""Karalyn Patterson"", ""John R. Hodges""]"	This study examines the impact of progressive degeneration of conceptual knowledge on the content words used in connected speech elicited using the Cookie Theft picture description (Goodglass & Kaplan. 1983). We began with an analysis of control subjects' descriptions with regard to word types and their frequency and imageability. Because the impairment of conceptual knowledge in semantic dementia is graded by concept familiarity, we created a model of a standardized normal Cookie Theft description that was then progressively degraded by the systematic removal of lower bands of word frequency. We drew two main predictions from this model: reduced availability of the lower bands of word frequency should result in (a) an apparent deficit for noun retrieval in relation to verb retrieval and (b) an apparent reverse imageability effect. Results from a longitudinal study. in which three patients with semantic dementia each described the Cookie Theft picture on three occasions during the progression of their disease, confirmed these predictions. An additional cross-sectional analysis, adding narratives from a larger number of cases, demonstrated that the decline in ability to produce suitable words for the picture description is closely related to the extent of semantic impairment as measured in tests of word comprehension and production. Both verbs and nouns are affected by the degradation of semantic memory; the fact that the impairment to noun production is manifested earlier and more catastrophically may be attributed to the relatively lower frequency of these terms.	thing ', 'stuff' and 'place') and an increased reliance on high frequency, high familiarity items and pronouns (#AUTHOR_TAG, Lambon Ralph, Patterson, & Hodges, 2000).

CC1382	141438903	A Note on Tractability and Artificial Intelligence	Tarek Besold	Simple Heuristics: The Foundations of Adaptive Social Behavior	"[""Gerd Gigerenzer"", ""Ralph Hertwig"", ""Thorsten Pachur""]"	This chapter shows how simple heuristics can be an essential tool for navigating the complexities and vagaries of social environments. The research program on the nature of social rationality presented here can be summarized by the following theses: As perceived by the human mind, the social world (Umwelt) is complex, but not necessarily more complex than the nonsocial world. However complex the social world may be, its complexity does not require cognitive complexity; rather, it entails conditions that make simple heuristics indispensible, such as intractability, multiple competing goals, and incommensurable reasons. Much of reasoning and decision making occurring in human and animal social environments can be modeled in terms of simple heuristics. Although simple heuristics forgo extensive information search and complex calculations, they can be as accurate and even more accurate than more complex strategies and/or can be used to reach other goals that are valued in social environments (e.g., transparency, fairness, speed). Heuristics can be simultaneously successful and simple by coopting evolved capacities. The capacities themselves can represent complex adaptive specializations (e.g., memory, movement tracking). Simple heuristics per se are neither rational nor irrational. Their rationality is ecological. That is, their performance depends on the match between the architecture of the heuristic and the structure of the environment in which it is used. The heuristics' simplicity inoculates them against overfitting and enables them to achieve robust performance given small samples of information. Simple heuristics can model adaptive decision making both in games against nature and in social games. There is no social intelligence distinct from nonsocial intelligence. Simple heuristics are tools of moderate generalizability. Some can be used only in games against nature, whereas others are restricted to social games. Still other heuristics can be applied in both types of games. Shedding light on the adaptive toolbox of simple heuristics used to navigate social environments, and characterizing their strengths and weaknesses, can help us design environments and/or heuristics in ways that improve public welfare. 	A growing number of researchers in these fields argues that humans in their common sense reasoning do not apply any full-fledged form of logical or probabilistic (and thus intractable) reasoning to possibly highly complex problems, but rather rely on mechanisms that reduce the latter to equivalent, simpler ones (see, e.g.,  #AUTHOR_TAG).	['And also on the more theoretical side, the described equivalence might form a connecting point to recent, much-noticed developments in cognitive science and cognitive psychology.', 'A growing number of researchers in these fields argues that humans in their common sense reasoning do not apply any full-fledged form of logical or probabilistic (and thus intractable) reasoning to possibly highly complex problems, but rather rely on mechanisms that reduce the latter to equivalent, simpler ones (see, e.g.,  #AUTHOR_TAG).', 'But although the number of supporters of these and similar ideas is constantly growing, a commonly accepted formal account of how this reduction process might work (or even technically be characterized and reconstructed) thus far has not been given.', 'Recognizing this as a serious deficit, Theorem 1 and its interpretation can provide inspiration and first hints at hypothesizing a specialized cognitive structure capable of computing the reduced instance of a problem, which then might allow for an efficient solving procedure -with the overall hypothesis in turn possibly serving as foundation and starting point for the development of computational accounts and (in the long run) a computational recreation of heuristics in computational cognitive models of reasoning, problem-solving and AI.']	0	['A growing number of researchers in these fields argues that humans in their common sense reasoning do not apply any full-fledged form of logical or probabilistic (and thus intractable) reasoning to possibly highly complex problems, but rather rely on mechanisms that reduce the latter to equivalent, simpler ones (see, e.g.,  #AUTHOR_TAG).']

It then turns to more recent developments in STS, outlining the importance of material semiotics to important traditions within the discipline including those influenced by actor network theory, feminism, and postcolonialism. It notes, in consistency with the Foucauldian approach, that material semiotics implies that knowledge traditions are performative, helping to create the realities that they describe.

This paper presents the results of a pilot study, which deployed a qualitative GIS technique to analyse the effectiveness of walked interviews in capturing data relating to peopleÕs understanding of place. We give an account of the walking interview exploring two issues: the relationship between what people say and where they say it; and qualitative and quantitative differences between data generated by walking and sedentary interviews. Our results indicate that the data generated through walking interviews are profoundly informed by the landscapes in which they take place, emphasising the importance of environmental features in shaping discussions. We also demonstrate a measureable difference between walking and sedentary techniques in the production of rich place narratives both in terms of their quantity and spatial specificity to the study area. The paper concludes by acknowledging that a technocentric analysis of place runs the risk of emphasising locational above humanistic elements, but argues that, done sensitively, a qualitative GIS approach offers great potential for engaging planners and policy makers with the importance of local connections to place.

CC1283	93144659	A Review of Psychometric Data Analysis and Applications	Geraldine Gray	A Survey and Future Vision of Data Mining in Educational Field	"[""R. Barahate Sachin"", ""M. Shelake Vijay""]"	Educational data mining is an emerging trend, concerned with developing techniques for exploring, and analyzing the huge data that come from the educational context. EDM is poised to leverage an enormous amount of research from data mining community and apply that research to educational problems in learning, cognition and assessment. In recent years, Educational data mining has proven to be more successful at many of these educational statistics problems due to enormous computing power and data mining algorithms. This paper surveys the history and applications of data mining techniques in the educational field. The objective is to introduce data mining to traditional educational system, web-based educational system, intelligent tutoring system, and e-learning. This paper describes how to apply the main data mining techniques such as prediction, classification, relationship mining, clustering, and social area networking to educational data.	As a result, the application of data analytics to educational settings is emerging as an evolving and growing research discipline (#AUTHOR_TAG & Vijay, 2012;Siemens & Baker, 2012), with the primary aim of exploring the value of such data in providing learning professionals, and students, with actionable information that could be used to enhance the learning environment (Siemens, 2012;Chatti et al., 2012).

CC2205	81800077	Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	Fabio Reale	A Brightening Coronal Loop Observed byTRACE. II. Loop Modeling and Constraints on Heating	"[""F. Reale"", ""G. Peres"", ""S. Serio"", ""R. M. Betta"", ""E. E. DeLuca"", ""L. Golub""]"	This is the second of two papers dedicated to the brightening of a coronal loop observed by the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) on 1998 June 26; it aims at hydrodynamic modeling of the brightening. Since the loop geometry is practically unchanged during the brightening, the evolution of the plasma confined in the loop is described with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic time-dependent numerical model, and from the results the emission along the loop in the TRACE 171 A band is synthesized. The information from Paper I is used to derive the geometry and the initial configuration of the loop as well as for comparison with the results of the model. The modeling is focused to determine the amount, spatial distribution, and evolution of the heating deposited in the loop to make the modeled evolution close to that observed with TRACE. We find that, in order to match the observed evolution and distribution of the brightness along the loop, the heating has to be nonsymmetrical in the loop, in particular, deposited between the apex and one footpoint (3 x 109 cm from the southern footpoint). A reasonable match with observations is obtained by assuming that the heating is switched on abruptly and then kept constant for the whole rising phase. An even better match is obtained with the heating high and constant for 100 s and then decaying exponentially with an e-folding time of 300 s. We discuss the resulting physical scenario; a bright irregular structure close to the loop in the TRACE images may be a tracer of the heating release.

CC852	74390377	Green Supply Chain Management Enablers: Mixed Methods Research	Rameshwar Dubey	Does sustainable supplier co-operation affect performance? Examining implications for the triple bottom line	"[""Daniel Hollos"", ""Constantin Blome"", ""Kai Foerstl""]"	The increasing importance of sustainable behaviour in business has enhanced its impact on supply chain management. Firms foster sustainability in their supplier base in reaction to growing sustainability requirements in various ways, including sustainable supplier co-operation. Knowledge about the effects of sustainable supplier co-operation on firm performance is limited; therefore, this study tests antecedents and implications of sustainable supplier co-operation according to the triple bottom line. A survey of Western European firms reveals that sustainable supplier co-operation has generally positive effects on firm performance across social, green and economic dimensions. However, only green practices have positive significant effects on economic performance, not social practices (e.g., child labour rules). In contrast to practitioner perceptions, investments in sustainability, for example through sustainable supplier co-operation does indeed result in sufficient returns.

CC332	81867052	Information of the chassis and information of the program in synthetic cells	Antoine Danchin	Mathematical Theory of Communication	"[""C E Shannon"", ""W Weaver""]"	The performance of an error correcting code is evaluated by its error probability, rate, and en/decoding complexity. The performance of a series of codes is evaluated by, as the block lengths approach infinity, whether their error probabilities decay to zero, whether their rates converge to capacity, and whether their growth in complexities stays under control. Over any discrete memoryless channel, I build codes such that: (1) their error probabilities and rates scale like random codes; and (2) their en/decoding complexities scale like polar codes. Quantitatively, for any constants $p,r>0$ s.t. $p+2r0$ s.t. $2r<1$, I construct a series of codes with block length $N$ approaching infinity, error probability $\exp(-(\log N)^t)$, rate $N^{-r}$ less than the capacity, and en/decoding complexity $O(N\log(\log N))$ per block. The two aforementioned results are built upon two pillars: a versatile framework that generates codes on the basis of channel polarization, and a calculus-probability machinery that evaluates the performances of codes. The framework that generates codes and the machinery that evaluates codes can be extended to many other scenarios in network information theory. To name a few: lossless compression, lossy compression, Slepian-Wolf, Wyner-Ziv, multiple access channel, wiretap channel, and broadcast channel. In each scenario, the adapted notions of error probability and rate approach their limits at the same paces as specified above.Comment: This is my PhD dissertation in single line spacin	The study of the genetic program as a text, applying accepted rules of the theory of information (#AUTHOR_TAG and Weaver 1949;Cover and Thomas 1991) to its analysis (H��naut et al. 1996) resulted in the emphasis placed on DNA in synthetic biology.

Holst""]"	Histones are frequently decorated with covalent modifications. These histone modifications are thought to be involved in various chromatin-dependent processes including transcription. To elucidate the relationship between histone modifications and transcription, we derived quantitative models to predict the expression level of genes from histone modification levels. We found that histone modification levels and gene expression are very well correlated. Moreover, we show that only a small number of histone modifications are necessary to accurately predict gene expression. We show that different sets of histone modifications are necessary to predict gene expression driven by high CpG content promoters (HCPs) or low CpG content promoters (LCPs). Quantitative models involving H3K4me3 and H3K79me1 are the most predictive of the expression levels in LCPs, whereas HCPs require H3K27ac and H4K20me1. Finally, we show that the connections between histone modifications and gene expression seem to be general, as we were able to predict gene expression levels of one cell type using a model trained on another one	Can other paramyxoviruses induce a pagetic phenotype?

Much of the debate about the applications and consequences of pharmacogenetics has been highly speculative, since little or no working technology is yet on the market. This article provides a novel analysis of the development of pharmacogenetics, and the social and ethical issues it raises, based on the sociology of technological expectations. In particular, it outlines how two alternative visions for the development of the technology are being articulated and embedded in a range of heterogeneous discourses, artefacts, actor strategies and practices, including: competing scientific research agendas, experimental technologies, emerging industrial structures and new ethical discourses. Expectations of how pharmacogenetics might emerge in each of these arenas are actively shaping the trajectory of this nascent technology and its potential socio-economic consequences.

Barchyn"", ""Chris H. Hugenholtz""]"	"Abstract Changes in surface conditions on cold-climate aeolian dunes are pronounced; during winter dunes are wet, snow covered, and/or frozen for extended periods of time. It is unknown how the critical wind speed for sediment transport (""threshold"") varies and how threshold may influence sediment transport predictions. Although the impact of surface conditions on threshold has been examined in synthetic experiments (wind tunnels), complicated feedbacks between threshold, sand transport, and surface conditions that occur in natural environments suggest that a ground-based empirical approach may provide enhanced insight. In this study we investigate threshold variability for 73 days during fall-winter-spring surface conditions from 18 November 2008 to 30 May 2009 in the Bigstick Sand Hills of Saskatchewan, Canada. Simultaneous measurements of threshold and atmospheric variables (air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and direction) were used to examine the extent to which surface erodibility was regulated by meteorology. Time-lapse images of the surface from a co-located camera were used for quality control and interpreting changes in the surface affecting threshold. Results reveal that threshold varied throughout the deployment (25-75% quartiles: 6.92-8.28 m s- 1; mean: 7.79 m s- 1). Threshold variability was especially evident at two scales: (i) event timescale and (ii) seasonal timescale. Event-scale variability peaked during mid-winter; in one event the threshold varied by 6 m s- 1 in 2 h with freezing and re-freezing of the surface and relatively constant atmospheric conditions. The causes of event-scale variability are complex though qualitatively related to changes of wind direction, antecedent meteorological conditions, and vertical variations of grain-scale bonding agents such as pore ice and moisture. Seasonal-scale changes manifested as an increase in threshold during fall, peaking in mid-winter, and decreasing in spring. Increased threshold in mid-winter was linked to lower insolation and air temperature, suggesting low erodibility due to the presence of pore ice. Correlation coefficients of threshold versus atmospheric variables yielded relatively weak correlations (air temperature: r = - 0.322; relative humidity: r = 0.388; solar radiation: r = - 0.309) that also varied according to wind direction, suggesting that the link between atmospheric conditions and surface erodibility on cold-climate dunes is complex. This contrasts with results from field-based studies in warmer climates and controlled wind tunnel experiments, which show a more direct link between atmospheric variables (temperature and humidity) and surface erodibility. Nevertheless, our results do show a seasonal pattern of threshold that could be important for modeling cold-climate aeolian sediment transport."	Often the presence of snow and interstitial ice binds eolian particles to surfaces necessitating higher threshold shear velocities for transport (#AUTHOR_TAG and Hugenholtz, 2012;Ollerhead et al., 2013), though the sublimation rate may be an important factor in grain release (Vandijk and Law, 1995).

CC828	74390377	Green Supply Chain Management Enablers: Mixed Methods Research	Rameshwar Dubey	Sustainability of manufacturing and services: Investigations for research and applications	"[""Angappa Gunasekaran"", ""Alain Spalanzani""]"	Sustainable business development (SBD) in manufacturing and services (M&S) has become a crucial issue in recent years owing to the impact of global warming, terrorism, earthquakes, hurricanes, and carbon footprint awareness, to site but a few causes. Various stakeholders, i.e. members of the human race, have realized that the future of the earth, and therefore that of future generations, is at stake. It is not enough to be successful in business, it is becoming imperative to safeguard the environment, safety and welfare of those alive today and prepare for those yet to come. There has been much discussion across numerous forums and media platforms including academic and industrial reports indicating the importance of SBD. However, few reports provide a complete overview of SBD in M&S, or the strategies and techniques available in the literature that would be helpful for SBD. An attempt has been made in this paper to provide an overview of the available SBD literature by classifying and then critically reviewing the material to develop a framework for SBD and suggest future research directions.

CC298	18509190	Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities: evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	Vincent Homburg	Diffusion of Information Technology Outsourcing: Influence Sources and the Kodak Effect	"[""Lawrence Loh"", ""N. Venkatraman""]"	The governance of an organizational information technology (IT) infrastructure is steadily shifting away from pure hierarchical and market mechanisms toward hybrid and partnership modes that involve external vendors. In particular, IT outsourcing has recently emerged as a significant administrative innovation in an organization's IT strategy. This paper seeks to explore the sources of influence in the adoption of this innovation. For this purpose, we generated a comprehensive sample of outsourcing contracts in the US using an electronic bibliometric search process. Using diffusion modeling, our empirical analysis shows that the adoption of IT outsourcing is motivated more by internal influence (or imitative behavior) than by external influence amongst the user organizations. Subsequently, we considered the widely publicized Eastman Kodak's outsourcing decision as a critical event to assess whether this internal influence is more pronounced in the post-Kodak regime than in the pre- Kodak regime. Our results show that internal influence is dominant in the post-Kodak regime but not in the pre-Kodak regime. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.	Innovation through mimicry is likely to occur when innovations are socially visible (Mahajan and Peterson, 1985;Dos Santos and Peffers, 1998), when causes, conditions and consequences are known (absence of causal ambiguity, Barney, 1991;#AUTHOR_TAG and Venkatraman, 1992) and when the success of the innovation is unlikely to be determined by path dependencies (Barney, 1991;Loh and Venkatraman, 1992).

However, these earlier meta-analyses also included non-randomized studies, and there are many featured studies in this area which were published after the recent meta-analysis. Method We conducted a systematic literature search and identified 29 randomized studies examining the effects of psychological treatments, with a total of 1628 subjects. The quality of studies varied. For the analyses, we used the computer program comprehensive meta-analysis (version 2.2.021; Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA). Results The mean effect size on social anxiety measures (47 contrast groups) was 0.70, 0.80 on cognitive measures (26 contrast groups) and 0.70 both on depression (19 contrast groups) and general anxiety measures (16 contrast groups). We found some heterogeneity, so we conducted a series of subgroup analyses for different variables of the studies. Studies with waiting-list control groups had significantly larger effect sizes than studies with placebo and treatment-as-usual control groups. Studies aimed at subjects who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria for social anxiety disorder had smaller effect sizes than studies in which other inclusion criteria were used. Conclusions This study once more makes it clear that psychological treatments of social anxiety disorder are effective in adults, but that they may be less effective in more severe disorders and in studies in which care-as-usual and placebo control groups are use	Several studies have assessed the clinical effectiveness of psychological and pharmacological treatments for social anxiety disorder #AUTHOR_TAG[11][12][13].

Belnap""]"	In arid lands, where vegetation is sparse or absent, the open ground is not bare but generally covered by a community of small, highly specialized organisms. Cyanobacteria, algae, microfungi, lichens, and bryophytes aggregate soil particles to form a coherent skin - the biological soil crust. It stabilizes and protects the soil surface from erosion by wind and water, influences water runoff and infiltration, and contributes nitrogen and carbon to desert soils. Soil surface disturbance, such as heavy livestock grazing, human trampling or off-road vehicles, breaks up the fragile soil crust, thus compromising its stability, structure, and productivity. This book is the first synthesis of the biology of soil crusts and their importance as an ecosystem component.

Benito"", ""Sverre Tomassen"", ""Jaime Bonache-P\u00e9rez"", ""Jos\u00e9 Pla-Barber""]"	This paper analyzes staffing decisions in foreign subsidiaries from the perspective of transaction cost theory. We focus on the ex post transaction costs of the employment relation. Specifically, we look at the monitoring, bonding, maladaptation, and bargaining costs of conducting activities in specific subsidiaries in a foreign country. We hypothesize that the transaction costs of using expatriates are lower than those generated by local employees, especially in the higher managerial echelons of foreign subsidiaries, but also that costs can be reduced as individuals become more experienced. We also conjecture that ex post transaction costs are influenced by cultural differences between the host and the home countries, and by characteristics of the companies and their subsidiaries. The framework is empirically corroborated by survey data on a sample of 145 Norwegian MNCs.Human resources Staffing decisions Multinational firms Transaction costs	"In situations with high cultural differences, recruiting local managers imply that companies incur high selection, training and control costs, and sending a ""trustworthy"" expatriate manager to the subsidiary could reduce such costs (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005;Boyacigiller and Adler, 1991;Nohria and Ghoshal, 1994;Yan et al., 2002)."

The study presented in this thesis developed and empirically tested a model of the antecedents and consequences of the working relationship between the Marketing Manager and R&D Manager at the NPD project level. By including interpersonal trust as a two-dimensional construct (affective and cognitive-based trust) and conceptualising it as a key mediating variable, the study provides great explanatory power regarding the interplay of important interpersonal dynamics such as communication frequency, quality of communication, functional conflict and interpersonal collaborative behaviour on the dependent variable of perceived relationship effectiveness. Further, the role that interpersonal politics play in shaping working relationships has not been previously addressed in the NPD literature and the new construct of \u27Perceptions of the Marketing Manager as a Political Ally\u27 was found to be one of the key antecedents of interpersonal trust and positive relationship dynamics. The data used to test the conceptual model was collected from 184 technically-trained respondents (e.g., R&D Managers and Engineers) from Australian firms predominantly involved in manufacturing activities.

CC1201	33121562	The numerical relativity breakthrough for binary black holes	Ulrich Sperhake	The structure of general relativity with a numerical illustration The collision of two black holes Ph	"[""L Smarr""]"	"The splitting of spacetime into space and time is analyzed by abstract methods, coordinate methods, and numerical computer methods. General relativity is assumed to be the correct theory of gravity and the Einstein field equations are studied in their canonical form. A comparison is made of the initial value and evolution equations for gravity in different formalisms (ADM, geometry of spacelike hypersurfaces, timelike congruences). These equations are then illustrated by a number of cosmological and black hole space-times. A study of coordinate conditions is undertaken. The axisymmetric (non-stationary and non-spherical) Einstein equations are discussed, and it is shown how to set up a numerical computer program to integrate these equations starting with a given initial data set. Various applications of this computer approach are discussed: collapse of rotating non-spherical stars, ""runaway"" collapse, and headon collisions of black holes. All of these situations would involve generation of gravitational radiation from the formation of black holes. The particular case of two nonrotating black holes colliding headon is chosen as a test case for the computer. The initial value problem is reviewed and then a computer program is written to generate the spacetime. This generation involves solving four coupled quasilinear hyperbolic (evolution) equations and one linear elliptic equation (maximal slicing) on each spacelike sheet. The numerical difficulties are discussed and graphical methods are used to present the result of the computations."

Electronic government(e-government) should achieve public innovation goals, such as redesigning information relationships among stakeholders, enhancing citizen participation in the policymaking process, and reinforcing policy enforcement to create public value. These goals are more valuable, but also more complex, than the digitization of existing governmental processes. Therefore, this study focused on a crucial e-government service, the Taiwan taxation service, to determine whether, in the current era in which people depend highly on network tools to send and receive information, online services are suitable for taxpayers and how to improve the service process. In this study, service design tools were combined with a qualitative research method, and observation and individual interviews of participants were conducted to record their perceptions of the tax service process. The results of the study facilitate identifying gaps in the seemingly convenient and progressive tax service process of Taiwan, including insufficient information provision, complex website operation, inconsistent information classification with users' logic, the lack of complete and consistent service for one-stop windows, and difficult document content. The taxation authority should integrate all online taxation services to achieve the expected public service (one-stop e-government window).

"[""Asher Koriat""]"	A recent study, using a perceptual task, indicated that two heads were better than one provided that the members could communicate freely, presumably sharing their confidence in their judgments. Capitalizing on recent work on subjective confidence, I replicated this effect in the absence of any dyadic interaction by selecting on each trial the decision of the more confident member of a virtual dyad. However, because subjective confidence monitors the consensuality rather than the accuracy of a decision, when most participants were in error, reliance on the more confident member yielded worse decisions than those of the better individual. Assuming that for each issue group decisions are dominated by the more confident member, these results help specify when groups will be more or less accurate than individuals.

CC2981	82867364	Wandering tales: evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language	Michael Corballis	From Hand to Mouth the Origins of Language	"[""M C Corballis""]"	This chapter claims, from the viewpoint of cognitive and evolutionary neuroscience, that language originated with a system of manual gestures. It reviews a broad range of data, including studies of language and communicative abilities in apes, the skeletal remains and artefacts in the archaeological record, and the language abilities of hearing, deaf, and language-impaired human populations. Whereas nonhuman primates tend to gesture only when others are looking, their vocalisations are not necessarily directed at others Ñ perhaps because of differences in voluntary control over gestures and vocalisations. One of the first steps in language evolution may have been the advent of bipedalism, which would have allowed the hands to be used for gestures instead of locomotion. There could have been a gradual evolution of a capacity for grammar, although language remained primarily gestural until relatively late in our evolutionary history. The shift from visual gestures to vocal ones would have been gradual, and largely autonomous speech likely arose following a genetic mutation between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago.	The idea that mirror neurons may underlie the evolution of language has been elaborated by a number of authors (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG, 2002;Arbib, 2005;Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2008).

CC911	81846122	Isotopic analysis of cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation associated with subarctic lichen and bryophyte species	Konstantin Gavazov	Nitrogen fixation in Arctic vegetation and soils from Svalbard, Norway	"[""B Solheim"", ""A Endal"", ""H Vigstad""]"	Nitrogen fixation was measured by the acetylene reduction method in a high Arctic ecosystem at Kongsfjorden, Spitsbergen (79¡N, 12¡E). The most important source of biologically fixed nitrogen was found in cyanobacteria either as free living colonies ofNostoc sp. in wet unvegetated or sparsely vegetated grounds or growing as epiphytes on bryophytes. Fixation associated with plant roots or in soil and peat samples had little or no significance for nitrogen input to the ecosystem. The ability to support an epiphytic flora of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria varied greatly between bryophyte species.Calliergon richardsonii andSanionia uncinata seemed especially well adapted for harbouring epiphytic cyanobacteria, but the extent of nitrogen fixation varied with the growing location. The rate of nitrogen fixation was greatly influenced by grazing by geese. In a geese-grazing area values were found with a maximum of 693.6±1.5 nmol C2H4h_1 g (dry weight)_1 while the maximum value for ungrazed areas was 65.3±16.6 nmol C2H4h_1 g (dry weight)_1. In the grazed area cyanobacteria were also found fixing nitrogen epiphytically on grass. The high plant productivity, supporting heavy grazing, clearly indicates an effective transfer of fixed nitrogen to the plant community. Under cliffs harbouring colonies of birds, the biological nitrogen fixation was inhibited by bird droppings.	Since nitrogen is a principal limiting environmental factor for plant growth and soil organic matter turnover in polar regions (Longton 1988) and biological nitrogen fixation there occurs mostly in cyanobacteria (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 1996), the interaction between cryptogams and cyanobacteria forms an important field for ecological investigations.

CC1488	18493118	Exploring the Relationship Between Local Support and the Success of Protected Areas	George Holmes	Protection politics and protest understanding resistance to conservation	"[""G Holmes""]"	This paper presents a framework to understand how conservation, in particular protected areas and national parks, are resisted, based on theo- ries of subaltern politics and a review of thirty-four published case studies. It is informed largely by Scott's concept of everyday resistance, which considers the informal subtle politics involved in social conflicts where there are con- straints on the ability of some people to take open, formal action. These ideas are critiqued and adapted to the particular context of conservation regula- tion, which is distinct from many other types of rural conflict. In particular, it recognises the importance of continuing banned livelihood practices such as hunting or farming in resistance, and the particular symbolism this has in conflicts. It also shows the importance of not just social factors in these con- flicts, but also the role of physical properties of natural resources in deter- mining the form of resistance. As well as the theoretical contribution, by showing the variety of responses to this resistance this paper aims to make conservation practitioners more aware of the forms local resistance can take. Rather than being a simple call for a more socially just conservation, it goes beyond this to provide a tool to make conservation better for both local com- munities and biodiversity.	They may chose to resist these costs through formal political opposition such as legal challenges, lobbying, and protest marches (e.g., Sullivan 2003), but more frequently through more subtle, indirect protests such as non-cooperation and sabotage (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007).

CC2687	6560220	Political Reforms and Public Policies: Evidence from Agricultural Protection	Alessandro Olper	Making Autocracy Work	"[""T Besley"", ""M Kudamatsu""]"	One of the key goals of political economy is to understand how institutional arrangements shape policy outcomes. This paper studies a comparatively neglected aspect of this - the forces that shape heterogeneous performance of autocracies. The paper develops a simple theoretical model of accountability in the absence of regularized elections. Leadership turnover is managed by a selectorate - a group of individuals on whom the leader depends to hold onto power. Good policy is institutionalized when the selectorate removes poorly performing leaders from office. This requires that the selectorate's hold on power is not too dependent on a specific leader being in office. The paper looks empirically at spells of autocracy to establish cases where it has been successful according to various objective criteria. We use these case studies to identify the selectorate in specific instances of successful autocracy. We also show that, consistent with the theory, leadership turnover in successful autocracies is higher than in unsuccessful autocracies. Finally, we show by exploiting leadership deaths from natural causes that successful autocracies appear to have found ways for selectorates to nominate successors without losing power - a feature which is also consistent with the theoretical approach	One possible explanation of such asymmetric effect of transitions to democracy and autocracy could be based on theories explaining (lack of) leadership turnovers and economic performance under autocracies (see #AUTHOR_TAG and Kudamatsu, 2008;Acemoglu et al. 2004).

A semantics for the dual and sound plural is given in which the number morpheme, located in the functional head Num, maps a set of atoms onto a set of sums. It is argued that the broken plural can denote either a set of sums or a set of groups, accounting for its distributive and collective readings, reflected in the agreement on the verb. I consider the class of collective nouns in Arabic, which are non-singular but have a marked singular form, called the singulative. I argue that the collective is underlyingly non-generic, with the same semantics as nouns like furniture in English, denoting a semilattice, which contains atoms as well as sums. The singulative is analysed as a classifier which maps the semilattice onto a set of atoms.

Rev. Lett. 101, 031601 (2008).] discuss a holographic black hole solution which exhibits a superconductorlike transition. In the superconducting phase the black holes show infinite DC conductivity. This gives rise to the possibility of deforming the solutions by turning on a time independent current (supercurrent), without any electric field. This type of deformation does not exist for normal (nonsuperconducting) black holes, due to the no-hair theorems. In this paper we have studied such a supercurrent solution and the associated phase diagram. Interestingly, we have found a 'special point' (critical point) in the phase diagram where the second order superconducting phase transition becomes first order. Supercurrent in superconducting materials is a well studied phenomenon in condensed matter systems. We have found some qualitative agreement with known results.	The effect of a vector current on the order of the phase transition was explored in #AUTHOR_TAG.

CC2989	82867364	Wandering tales: evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language	Michael Corballis	Gesture and the Nature of Language	"[""D F Armstrong""]"	This book proposes a radical alternative to dominant views of the evolution of language, and in particular the origins of syntax. The authors argue that manual and vocal communication developed in parallel, and that the basic elements of syntax are intrinsic to gesture. They draw on evidence from areas such as primatology, anthropology, and linguistics, to present a groundbreaking account of the notion that language emerged through visible bodily action. They go on to examine the implications of their findings for linguistic theory and theories of the biological evolution of the capacity for language. Written in a clear and accessible style, Gesture and the Nature of Language will be indispensable reading for all those interested in the origins of language.

They are idiothetic in the sense that respondents begin by providing idiographic lists of their current goals, which they then rate using nomothetic rating scales. These ratings can be processed to provide indices and profiles that characterize the individual's motivational structure. There is, to be sure, a history of motivational assessment using other means, especially thematic apperceptive methods and psychometric questionnaires. In their present state of development, however, these lack the combination of having both specificity and comprehensiveness in describing an individual's motivational structure. The MSQ and PCI provide these properties. This chapter is purely descriptive. Subsequent chapters provide evidence regarding the reliability, factor structure, and validity of the information provided by the MSQ and PCI, as well as their application in motivational counseling.

Foster"", ""Arthur Allen""]"	Throughout the eastern United States, plant species distributions and community patterns have developed in re- sponse to heterogeneous environmental conditions and a wide range of historical factors, including complex histories of natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Despite increased rec- ognition of the importance of disturbance in determining forest composition and structure, few studies have assessed the relative influence of current environment and historical factors on moder vegetation, in part because detailed knowl- edge of prior disturbance is often lacking. In the present study, we investigate moder and historical factors that control veg- etation patterns at Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts, USA. Similar to the forested uplands throughout the north- eastern United States, the site is physiographically heteroge- neous and has a long and complex history of natural and anthropogenic disturbance. However, data on forest composi- tion and disturbance history collected over the past > 90 years allow us to evaluate the importance of historical factors rigor- ously, which is rarely possible on other sites. Soil analyses and historical sources document four catego- ries of historical land use on areas that are all forested today: cultivated fields, improved pastures/mowings, unimproved pastures, and continuously forested woodlots.

CC1822	29411898	Action and Valence Modulate Choice and Choice-Induced Preference Change	Raphael Koster	Varieties of regret: A debate and partial resolution.	"[""Thomas Gilovich"", ""Victoria Husted Medvec"", ""Daniel Kahneman""]"	Different interpretations of an apparent temporal pattern to the experience of regret were addressed through joint research. T. Gilovich and V. H. Medvec (1995a) argued that people regret actions more in the short term and inactions more in the long run because the sting of regrettable action diminishes relatively quickly, whereas the pain of regrettable inaction lingers longer. D. Kahneman (1995) disagreed, arguing that people&apos;s long-term regrets of inaction are largely wistful and therefore not terribly troublesome. Three studies that examined the emotional profile of action and inaction regrets established considerable common ground. Action regrets were found to elicit primarily &quot;hot&quot; emotions (e.g., anger), and inaction regrets were found to elicit both feelings of wistfulness (e.g., nostalgia) and despair (e.g., misery). Thus, some inaction regrets are indeed wistful (as Kahneman argued), whereas others are troublesome (as Gilovich and Medvec maintained). Disagreement is a powerful engine of scientific advance. It sharpens conceptual boundaries, directs attention to neglected issues, and, of course, prompts the design of would-be decisive experiments.

CC609	82403724	Life, hierarchy, and the thermodynamic machinery of planet Earth	Axel Kleidon	Atmospheric homeostasis by and for the biosphere: the gaia hypothesis	"[""James E. Lovelock"", ""Lynn Margulis""]"	During the time, 3.2 x 10 9 years, that life has been present on Earth, the physical and chemical conditions of most of the planetary surface have never varied from those most favourable for life. The geological record reads that liquid water was always present and that the pH was never far from neutral. During this same period, however, the Earth's radiation environment underwent large changes. As the sun moved along the course set by the main sequence of stars its output will have increased at least 30% and possibly 100%. It may also have fluctuated in brightness over periods of a few million years. At the same time hydrogen was escaping to space from the Earth and so causing progressive changes in the chemical environment. This in turn through atmospheric compositional changes could have affected the Earth's radiation balance. It may have been that these physical and chemical changes always by blind chance followed the path whose bounds are the conditions favouring the continued existence of life. This paper offers an alternative explanation that, early after life began it acquired control of the planetary environment and that this homeostasis by and for the biosphere has persisted ever since. Historic and contemporary evidence and arguments for this hypothesis will be presented.

CC309	18509190	Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities: evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	Vincent Homburg	Individual differences, environmental scanning, innovation framing, and champion behavior: key predictors of project performance	"[""J Howell"", ""C Shea""]"	Abstract Although increasing evidence points to the importance of champions for keeping product innovation ideas alive and thriving, little is known about how champions identify potential product innovation ideas, how they present these ideas to gain much needed support from key stakeholders, and their impact on innovation project performance over time. Jane M. Howell and Christine M. Shea address this knowledge gap by using measures of individual differences, environmental scanning, innovation framing and champion behavior to predict the performance of 47 product innovation projects. Champion behavior was defined as expressing confidence in the innovation, involving and motivating others to support the innovation, and persisting under adversity. Interviews with 47 champions were conducted to collect information about the innovation projects and the champions' tendency to frame the innovation as an opportunity or threat. Survey data were obtained from three sources: 47 champions provided information on their personal characteristics (locus of control and breadth of interest) and activities (environmental scanning), 47 division managers subjectively assessed project performance at two points in time, and 237 innovation team members rated the frequency of champion behavior. The results revealed that an internal locus of control orientation was positively related to framing the innovation as an opportunity, and breadth of interest was positively related to environmental scanning. Environmental scanning of documents and framing the innovation as a threat was negatively related to champion behavior, while environmental scanning through people was positively related to champion behavior. Champion behavior positively predicted project performance over a one-year interval. Overall, the findings suggest that in scanning the environment for new ideas, the most effective source of information is the champion's personal network of people inside and outside the organization. Also, the simple labeling of an idea as a threat appears to diminish a champion's perceived influence and erode credibility in promoting an innovation. From the perspective of division managers, champions make a positive contribution to project performance over time, reinforcing the crucial role that champions play in new product development process.	It is especially through these kinds of integration mechanisms that ideas and knowledge are actually transfused, translated and framed rather than merely being imitated (#AUTHOR_TAG and Shea, 2001; see also Bressant and Rush, 1995;Rice and Rogers, 1980;Sahlin and Wedlin, 2008;Silva and Hirscheim, 2007).

CC858	74390377	Green Supply Chain Management Enablers: Mixed Methods Research	Rameshwar Dubey	Renaissance of case research as a scientific method	"[""Mikko Ketokivi"", ""Thomas Choi""]"	Abstract Since the seminal article by Eisenhardt (1989) , scholarly interest in case research has mushroomed in operations management and organization sciences. Volumes of methodological texts are matched with a massive amount of empirical research that seeks to apply and further develop case research as a scientific method. What is missing from this literature is a treatment of the methodological diversity of case research. In this paper, we seek to unveil this heterogeneity by describing three distinct methodological accounts of case study: theory generation, theory testing, and theory elaboration. Each approach has its own idiosyncrasies, in particular when it comes to the interplay between theory and empirics. A typical case research incorporates both existing theories and empirical data to varying degrees. In light of this heterogeneity, we re-interpret key aspects of extant contributions and discuss guidelines for future case research. We propose that ultimately, case research rigor is determined by attention to idiosyncrasy and transparency of reasoning. We conclude by arguing that we have witnessed in the past 25 years in organization research what amounts to the Renaissance of case research.	In recent years the use of the case study approach has attracted interest in the operations and supply chain management community (#AUTHOR_TAG and Choi, 2014).

CC966	81768818	Identifying restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations during tumor progression: effects of passengers, evolutionary models, and sampling	Ramon Diaz-Uriarte	De novo discovery of mutated driver pathways in cancer	"[""F Vandin"", ""E Upfal"", ""B J Raphael""]"	"Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies are enabling genome-wide measurements of somatic mutations in large numbers of cancer patients. A major challenge in the interpretation of these data is to distinguish functional ""driver mutations"" important for cancer development from random ""passenger mutations."" A common approach for identifying driver mutations is to find genes that are mutated at significant frequency in a large cohort of cancer genomes. This approach is confounded by the observation that driver mutations target multiple cellular signaling and regulatory pathways. Thus, each cancer patient may exhibit a different combination of mutations that are sufficient to perturb these pathways. This mutational heterogeneity presents a problem for predicting driver mutations solely from their frequency of occurrence. We introduce two combinatorial properties, coverage and exclusivity, that distinguish driver pathways, or groups of genes containing driver mutations, from groups of genes with passenger mutations. We derive two algorithms, called Dendrix, to find driver pathways de novo from somatic mutation data. We apply Dendrix to analyze somatic mutation data from 623 genes in 188 lung adenocarcinoma patients, 601 genes in 84 glioblastoma patients, and 238 known mutations in 1000 patients with various cancers. In all data sets, we find groups of genes that are mutated in large subsets of patients and whose mutations are approximately exclusive. Our Dendrix algorithms scale to whole-genome analysis of thousands of patients and thus will prove useful for larger data sets to come from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other large-scale cancer genome sequencing projects."	Thus, it probably pays off to try to use other approaches that incorporate information about non-silent mutation rates, pathway information together with combinatorial properties of drivers in pathwayws, or functional consequences of mutations to differentiate drivers from passengers [73][74][75][76][77]#AUTHOR_TAG.

Using frequency-based statistics when we do not know which mutations are true passengers can lead to a heavy performance penalty mainly in the form of failure to discover existing restrictions.', 'In addition, having to filter genes makes it much harder to intuitively understand, and reason about, what is likely to happen in any scenario, and this in turn makes interpretation of results and reconciliation of output from different methods much harder.', 'Thus, it probably pays off to try to use other approaches that incorporate information about non-silent mutation rates, pathway information together with combinatorial properties of drivers in pathwayws, or functional consequences of mutations to differentiate drivers from passengers [73][74][75][76][77]#AUTHOR_TAG.', 'It might not always be possible to use these other methods.', 'If we need to rely on frequency-based approaches, selecting those mutations with a frequency larger than 5% is an overall reasonable choice (but not the single best choice for any performance measure other than Diff).', '4.

CC2176	5226895	Interventions Using High-Technology Communication Devices: A State of the Art Review	Susan Baxter	Clinical application of an EEG-based brainâ€“computer interface: a case study in a patient with severe motor impairment	"["" Neuper""]"	OBJECTIVE This case study describes how a completely paralyzed patient, diagnosed with severe cerebral palsy, was trained over a period of several months to use an electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) for verbal communication.   METHODS EEG feedback training was performed in the patient's home (clinic), supervised from a distant laboratory with the help of a 'telemonitoring system'. Online feedback computation was based on single-trial analysis and classification of specific band power features of the spontaneous EEG. Task-related changes in brain oscillations over the course of training steps was investigated by quantifying time-frequency maps of event-related (de-)synchronization (ERD/ERS).   RESULTS The patient learned to 'produce' two distinct EEG patterns, beta band ERD during movement imagery vs. no ERD during relaxing, and to use this for BCI-controlled spelling. Significant learning progress was found as a function of training session, resulting in an average accuracy level of 70% (correct responses) for letter selection. 'Copy spelling' was performed with a rate of approximately one letter per min.   CONCLUSIONS The proposed BCI training procedure, based on electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback and concomitant adaptation of feature extraction and classification, may improve actual levels of communication ability in locked-in patients. 'Telemonitoring-assisted' BCI training facilitates clinical application in a larger number of patients.

CC857	74390377	Green Supply Chain Management Enablers: Mixed Methods Research	Rameshwar Dubey	Performance measurement of supplier relationships Supply Chain Management	"[""Mihalis Giannakis""]"	Purpose Ð The purpose of this paper is to develop an analytical model for assessing the performance of supplier relationships (SRs). The majority of performance measurement models incorporate hard quantitative measures that are not appropriate for the soft features of business relationships. As they are usually designed by the customer organisation, they are imposed on suppliers, they do not take into account the relationship as a unit of analysis and therefore they carry a bias in their interpretation. Design/methodology/approach Ð For the development of the model, the nature of a SR is conceptualised in terms of two typologies: one based on the level of its analysis and one based on its genesis and development and the methodology of gap analysis is used. Findings Ð The performance of SRs is assessed in terms of several disparities that exist between the participating parties' perceptions of the nature and their performance to the relationship as well as their perception of their partners' performance to the relationship. The proposed model can be utilised with qualitative (interviews) as well as quantitative (survey) data. The aim of any improvement strategy for the performance of SRs should be to minimise the gaps in partners' perceptions and pursuit the role that the parties play in the relationship and identify those factors that have greater importance to the relationship. Appropriate strategies should be then selected to minimise the gaps in the perceptions of the individuals against these factors. Research limitations/implications Ð The usefulness of the model in assessing SRs' performance lies in the fact that a holistic view of SRs is achieved by taking into account both soft and hard dimensions of SRs. Contrasting the model to other performance management models its major limitation is that it cannot be used as a ÒscientificÓ diagnostic tool for suggestion of best practices. Further research is required to identify the causes behind poor performance in a particular area and then devise appropriate strategies. Practical implications Ð The proposed model can be used in different context (manufacturing or services), does not require specialised knowledge or external consulting and provides scope for improvement of relationships between departments within an organisation. Originality/value Ð This paper emphasises the importance of performance measurement of SRs and proposes an innovative for performance measurement model, which overcomes the limitations of existing tools and can be applied in several contexts.

A total of 12 meetings were held.The intervention group reported a significantly higher score for the variable ""management of everyday life"" (p <0.005) and for the variable ""health care consumption"" (p <0.001) than did the control group. Patients with high agency orientation benefited more from the program with regard to pain reduction and improved pain coping than did those patients with low agency orientation (p <0.05).

Peres"", ""S. Serio"", ""G. S. Vaiana"", ""R. Rosner""]"	The response of magnetically confined atmospheres to perturbations in the temperature and density distribution, and the local heating rate by means of a one-dimensional time-dependent hydrodynamical code, which incorporates the full energy, momentum and mass conservation equations is studied. These studies extend the linear instability analysis of Habbal and Rosner (1979) into the finite-amplitude regime, and generalize the confined atmosphere models of Serio et al., to the time-dependent domain. The results show that closed coronal atmospheres are stable against finite-amplitude perturbations if the chromospheric response is taken into account; and observed correlated increases in coronal density and temperature can only be achieved under quiescent conditions by increasing the heat deposition rate relatively more in the chromosphere than in the corona.

Weber"", ""J. T. Schmelz"", ""E. E. DeLuca"", ""J. K. Roames""]"	An early result from the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) was that the EUV filter ratios for many narrow coronal loops (widths of a few arcseconds) were found to cluster within the small range 0.50-1.70, as functions of position along loop length. The most common interpretation is that the temperature along the loop is in fact nearly constant with a value between 1.1 and 1.3 MK. This interpretation has resulted in a class of TRACE loop models with heating close to the footpoints. We analyze the filter ratio method to show that the constant TRACE 195 A/173 A ratios can be reproduced by multithermal differential emission measures (DEMs) along the line of sight over a wide range of peak temperatures, so long as the distribution is relatively flat and spans the temperature response of both channels. Furthermore, in the limit of flat (i.e., very multithermal) DEMs, the filter ratio method is biased toward the ratio of the integrals of the temperature response functions. This result is general to any measurement of intensity ratios that are formed over a nonzero temperature range (e.g., narrow passbands and ion emission lines).	Narrowband filters can show non-unique dependencies of filter ratio values on temperature (e.g., Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2007), due to the presence of several important spectral lines in the bands, but a more general problem can be the bias to detect narrow ranges of temperatures forced by the specific instrument characteristics (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005).

Gordon"", ""Gary S. Dell""]"	"Theories of sentence production that involve a convergence of activation from conceptual-semantic and syntactic-sequential units inspired a connectionist model that was trained to produce simple sen-tences. The model used a learning algorithm that resulted in a sharing of responsibility (or ""division of labor"") between syntactic and semantic inputs for lexical activation according to their predictive power. Semantically rich, or ""heavy"", verbs in the model came to rely on semantic cues more than on syntactic cues, whereas semantically impoverished, or ""light"", verbs relied more on syntactic cues. When the syntactic and semantic inputs were lesioned, the model exhibited patterns of production characteristic of agrammatic and anomic aphasic patients, respectively. Anomic models tended to lose the ability to retrieve heavy verbs, whereas agrammatic models were more impaired in retrieving light verbs. These results obtained in both sentence production and single-word naming simulations. Moreover, simulated agrammatic lexical retrieval was more impaired overall in sentences than in single-word tasks, in agree-ment with the literature.

To take advantage of multicore processor, a great number of previously designed embedded applications need reengineering processes before they are ported to run accurately and efficiently. Massive refactoring of sequential programs to multi-thread programs is required. Parallelisation refactoring is generally implemented by programmers. As multicore processors become more and more complex, the potential human error in the refactoring process increased dramatically. To provide the necessary assurance of correctness, a program transformation framework to validate the parallelised programs is proposed, which is a formal approach to transforming the multi-thread program while validating if the functional behaviour of the existing sequential program is preserved.

The literature on business networks tends to downplay the role of managerial initiative in network change. The change management literature addresses such initiative, but with its single-firm perspective it overlooks the interdependence of network actors. In exploring the void between these two streams of literature, we deploy the concept of network pictures to discuss managed change in network settings. We analyze a change project from the furniture industry and address the consequences of attempting to manage change activities in a network context characterized by limited managerial authority over these activities. Our analysis suggests that change efforts unfold as a negotiated process during which the change project is re-negotiated to fit the multiple actor constituencies. The degree of overlap in the co-existing network pictures of the involved actors is found to be decisive for the possibility of successfully implementing network change.

CC999	11277201	Methodology and Campaign Design for the Evaluation of Semantic Search Tools	Stuart Wrigley	SemSearch: A Search Engine for the Semantic Web	"[""Yuangui Lei"", ""Victoria Uren"", ""Enrico Motta""]"	Abstract. Semantic search promises to produce precise answers to user queries by taking advantage of the availability of explicit semantics of information in the context of the semantic web. Existing tools have been primarily designed to enhance the performance of traditional search technologies but with little support for naive users, i.e., ordinary end users who are not necessarily familiar with domain specific semantic data, ontologies, or SQL-like query languages. This paper presents SemSearch, a search engine, which pays special attention to this issue by hiding the complexity of semantic search from end users and making it easy to use and effective. In contrast with existing semantic-based keyword search engines which typically compromise their capability of handling complex user queries in order to overcome the problem of knowledge overhead, SemSearch not only overcomes the problem of knowledge overhead but also supports complex queries. Further, SemSearch provides comprehensive means to produce precise answers that on the one hand satisfy user queries and on the other hand are self-explanatory and understandable by end users. A prototype of the search engine has been implemented and applied in the semantic web portal of our lab. An initial evaluation shows promising results.

The models, called RICE-99 (for the Regional Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy) and DICE-99 (for the Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and the Economy) build on the authors' earlier work, particularly their RICE and DICE models of the early 1990s. Humanity is risking the health of the natural environment through a myriad of interventions, including the atmospheric emission of trace gases such as carbon dioxide, the use of ozone-depleting chemicals, the engineering of massive land-use changes, and the destruction of the habitats of many species. It is imperative that we learn to protect our common geophysical and biological resources. Although scientists have studied greenhouse warming for decades, it is only recently that society has begun to consider the economic, political, and institutional aspects of environmental intervention. To do so raises formidable challenges of data modeling, uncertainty, international coordination, and institutional design. Attempts to deal with complex scientific and economic issues have increasingly involved the use of models to help analysts and decision makers understand likely future outcomes as well as the implications of alternative policies. This book presents in detail a pair of models of the economics of climate change. The models, called RICE-99 (for the Regional Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy) and DICE-99 (for the Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and the Economy) build on the authors' earlier work, particularly their RICE and DICE models of the early 1990s. They can help policy makers design better economic and environmental policies.	To take the DICE model as an example (#AUTHOR_TAG and Boyer 2000;Nordhaus 2008), it can easily be shown that the assumption of a quadratic relationship between damages and temperature, together with the modellers' specific coefficient values, implies that global warming can reach more than 18��C before the equivalent of 50% of global GDP is lost.	"['Recent work by, among others, Martin Weitzman (2010) and Frank Ackerman and colleagues (2010) has questioned the prevailing assumptions made about functional form.', ""To take the DICE model as an example (#AUTHOR_TAG and Boyer 2000;Nordhaus 2008), it can easily be shown that the assumption of a quadratic relationship between damages and temperature, together with the modellers' specific coefficient values, implies that global warming can reach more than 18��C before the equivalent of 50% of global GDP is lost."", 'This seems remarkable, since, for example, such temperatures are likely to test the limits of human physiology (Sherwood and Huber 2010).', 'While the parameters of the damage function in PAGE are modelled as random, such that damages reach up to around 10% of global GDP when global warming reaches 5��C, it has equally been argued that 5��C constitutes an environmental transformation, being a larger change in global mean temperature than exists between the present day and the peak of the last ice age.', 'Surely it is at least possible that climate damages will exceed 10% of global GDP upon 5��C warming?', 'As far as FUND is concerned, Figure 1A of the Interagency Working Group shows that its more complex, sectorally disaggregated approach implies total damages are actually slowing as warming passes 5��C, and at 8��C above pre-industrial they are only about 7% of GDP. 2', 'learly this begs the question of how much higher the SCC might be, if the damage function becomes steeper.', 'A recent paper by Ackerman and Stanton (2011) attempts to answer it using the DICE model, applying a functional form proposed by Weitzman (2010).', 'Furthermore, they also question the damage estimates of the models at low temperatures, drawing on work by Michael Hanemann (2008) that argues damages could also be significantly higher in this realm.', 'Looking at these changes separately and together, they show that the SCC could be several times, even orders of magnitude, higher.', 'This result is in fact corroborated by some recent analysis of my own.']"	5	"[""To take the DICE model as an example (#AUTHOR_TAG and Boyer 2000;Nordhaus 2008), it can easily be shown that the assumption of a quadratic relationship between damages and temperature, together with the modellers' specific coefficient values, implies that global warming can reach more than 18��C before the equivalent of 50% of global GDP is lost.""]"

Damage to the avian hippocampus disrupts performance in laboratory tasks that tap spatial learning and memory, and also disrupts both pigeon homing and cache recovery by food-storing birds. Further evidence of hippocampal involvement in food-storing is provided by the fact that the hippocampus of food-storing birds is selectively enlarged. These findings lend support to the notion that the hippocampus plays a critical role in spatial learning and memory. However, avian hippocampal lesions (like mammalian hippocampal lesions) also disrupt certain laboratory tasks that do not have an overt spatial component. Moreover, analysis of the effects of hippocampal lesions on navigation find, first, that basic navigational processes are left intact, and second, that at least some of the disruption of homing may be caused by disruption of the associability of information derived from the sun compass - a non-spatial deficit. Finally, attempts to demonstrate that the enlarged hippocampus of food-storing birds is associated with enhanced spatial memory have failed to deliver conclusive support. The extensive parallels between effects of hippocampal lesions in birds and mammals suggest that both the spatial and the non-spatial deficits form part of a single syndrome, one that cannot readily be explained in terms of disruption of specifically spatial processes.	Similarly, birds that cache items of food in multiple locations, and later retrieve them, have larger hippocampi than birds that do not cache (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2002).

DATA SOURCE AND METHODS Exploratory analyses were conducted on an unweighted subsample (n=987) of the accelerometry data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey. Participants were asked to wear an accelerometer for 7 consecutive days. Calibration, reliability, biological plausibility and compliance issues were explored using descriptive statistics.   RESULTS Ongoing calibration is an effective method for identifying malfunctioning accelerometers. The percentage of files deemed viable for analysis depends on participant compliance, the allowable interruption period chosen and the minimum wear-time-per-day criterion. A 60-minute allowable interruption period and 10-hours-per-day wear time criteria resulted in 95% of the subsample having at least 1 valid day, and 84% having at least 4 valid days.   INTERPRETATION Before the derivation of physical activity outcomes, accelerometry data should undergo standardized quality control and data reduction procedures to prevent mis-representation of the results. Incomplete accelerometry data should be handled carefully, and strategies to improve compliance in the field are warranted.	However, the number of observations left for analyses declined with increased wear time criteria, as shown previously #AUTHOR_TAG.	['Nevertheless, our findings suggest that 6-9 days of measurement might be needed to reliably capture SED and PA, given a wear time criteria of 10-12 h/day.', 'This necessitates an increased monitoring length, compared to that of 7 days that is usually applied.', 'Although this might improve validity of study conclusions, the burden for subjects should be kept minimal to maximize response rate and adherence to the monitoring protocol.', 'Feedback from our subjects clearly indicated that 21 days of monitoring was a lengthy measurement.', 'However, 14 days would be appropriate, under the assumption that subjects obtain 4-5 valid days per week.', 'Still, this is a matter of the research question posed, as population-estimates on a group level requires less reliability than individual-level estimates.', 'Also, an increased wear time per day is an option.', 'However, the number of observations left for analyses declined with increased wear time criteria, as shown previously #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Thus, the choice of wear time criteria is a trade-off between reliability and power, of which both are of crucial importance to arrive at valid conclusions, as the loss of both will bias conclusions towards the null-hypothesis.', 'As noise in predictor (x-) variables will lead to attenuation of regression coefficients by biasing coefficients towards the null (regression dilution bias), and noise in outcome (y-) variables will increase standard errors and increase the likelihood of performing type II errors [1], unreliable measures will weaken researchers ability to make valid conclusions in PA epidemiology.', 'If PA is modeled as an exposure variable, increased sample size on the expense of reliability will only make the results more precisely wrong [1].']	0	['Nevertheless, our findings suggest that 6-9 days of measurement might be needed to reliably capture SED and PA, given a wear time criteria of 10-12 h/day.', 'However, the number of observations left for analyses declined with increased wear time criteria, as shown previously #AUTHOR_TAG.']

Several hundred new compounds have been isolated from the liverworts (Marchantiophyta), and more than 40 new carbon skeletons of terpenoids and aromatic compounds were found. Most of the liverworts studied elaborate characteristic odiferous, pungent, and bitter-tasting compounds, of which many show antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, allergic contact dermatitis, cytotoxic, insecticidal, anti-HIV, plant growth regulatory, neurotrophic, NO production and superoxide anion radical release inhibitory, muscle relaxing, antiobesity, piscicidal, and nematocidal activities. The biological effects ascribed to the liverworts are mainly due to lipophilic sesqui- and diterpenoids, phenolic compounds, and polyketides, which are the principal constituents of their oil bodies. Some mosses and liverworts produce significant levels of vitamin B2 and tocopherols, as well as prostaglandin-like highly unsaturated fatty acids. The most characteristic chemical phenomenon of the liverworts is that most of the sesqui- and diterpenoids are enantiomers of those found in higher plants. In this review, the chemical constituents and potential medicinal uses of bryophytes are discussed.	Liverworts are known for rich composition of secondary compounds (#AUTHOR_TAG 1995(Asakawa , 2004Mues 2000), many of which exhibit antimicrobial properties (Asakawa 2008).

CC439	30932485	Disentangling supply and demand shifts: the impacts on world salmon prices	Eivind Braekkan	Westernization of Asian diets and the transformation of food systems: Implications for research and policy	"[""Prabhu Pingali""]"	Rapid economic and income growth, urbanization, and globalization are leading to a dramatic shift of Asian diets away from staples and increasingly towards livestock and dairy products, vegetables and fruit, and fats and oils. While the diversification of diets away from the traditional dominance of rice with rising incomes is expected and observed, current food consumption patterns are showing signs of convergence towards a Western diet. Globalization and the consequent global interconnectedness of the urban middle class, is the driving force behind the convergence of diets. The rapid spread of global supermarket chains and fast food restaurants are reinforcing the above trends. The following six key stylised facts characterize the changes in food demand in Asia: i) reduced per capita consumption of rice; ii) increased consumption per capita of wheat and wheat based products; iii) increased diversity in the food groups consumed; iv) rise in high protein and energy dense diets; v) increased consumption of temperate zone products; and vi) the rising popularity of convenience food and beverages. As the demand profile changes with economic growth and globalisation, so the supply systems must adapt to accommodate this change. Asian agriculture is on an irreversible path leading away from its traditional preoccupation with cereal crop production, especially rice, towards a production system that is becoming increasingly commercialized and diversified. This paper addresses the opportunities and constraints in the transformation process. It discusses the prospects for the small farmer to share in the benefits from greater market integration. Finally, the paper identifies an agenda for science, technology and policy that will allow for a smoother transition to the emerging production and food supply system.	The Westernization of diets in Asian economies (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007), along with rapid income growth, are also highlighted as important drivers (Enders and Holt 2012).	"['If prices increase due to increased demand this has an entirely different implication than if they rise because of reduced supply.', 'Demand growth will lead to increased production, to the extent that producers are able to respond to higher prices.', 'If prices increase due to supply contractions, it could be a reflection of unsolved problems in the production process, a substitution of production away from food to other commodities, or a decline in productivity growth.', 'Different causes of price changes have vastly different implications for food security and welfare both for producers and consumers.', 'The task of identifying the factors behind price changes in food commodity markets is complex.', 'Many of these factors are difficult, if not impossible, to measure appropriately.', 'Thus, the simple question of ""why do prices change?""', 'usually requires elaborate investigation.', 'Trostle (2008) identifies several demand and supply factors that simultaneously contributed to a recent increase in food prices.', 'Gilbert (2010) emphasizes the impact of common factors on the general level of agricultural food prices.', 'He argues that investments in index-based agricultural futures markets were a major cause of the broad rise in food prices in [2007][2008].', 'The fundamental driver of such index investments is the belief that rapid economic growth in China will increase demand for commodities in general.', 'The Westernization of diets in Asian economies (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007), along with rapid income growth, are also highlighted as important drivers (Enders and Holt 2012).', 'Another driver is the diversion of food crops into the production of biofuels, which is generally considered to influence long-run agricultural price levels (Serra and Zilberman 2013).', 'The recent price booms have also lead to increased interest in the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis of continuous long-term declines in primary commodity prices (Balagtas and Holt 2009;Harvey and Kellard 2010;Enders and Holt 2012).', ""Results yield mixed evidence of the hypothesis' efficacy: Harvey and Kellard (2010) for instance, find longrun decline in the price of only 11 of 25 major commodities.""]"	4	['The Westernization of diets in Asian economies (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007), along with rapid income growth, are also highlighted as important drivers (Enders and Holt 2012).']

Sebastian Reiche"", ""Miriam Moeller""]"	International human resource managers are progressively encountering new challenges pertinent to the manageability of multiculturalism when staffing global positions. The literature indicates that trust in the global organization context increases subsidiary acquiescence to and cooperation with the headquarters, making this concept an important component in developing inpatriates' relationships with the headquarters organization. The purpose of this article is to examine a range of antecedents to trust building, distinguish between two different types of trust, affective vs. competence-based, and examine key outcomes of inpatriates' trust building in global organizations. Reference point theory is used as the foundation for an analysis of the deliberate choice of the inpatriate manager and parent organization alike to adjust to new organizational conditions. In addition, it provides guidance in examining the effects of assignment longevity. The authors propose that through the development of competencies such as trust building, an organization is better able to implement global learning and talent management and in turn develop more effective and ongoing global relationships based on trust.	Furthermore, MNC headquarters may try to increase trust between headquarters and subsidiaries (#AUTHOR_TAG, et al., 2011).	['One strategy pertains to reducing opportunism.', 'Previous studies have demonstrated that opportunism can be reduced mainly through two mechanisms: Increased formalization and/or trust.', 'Consequently, by implementing more formalized procedures such as rules and routines, clearer role responsibilities, and a better identification of complementary tasks and responsibilities between the MNC and the subsidiary, opportunities for opportunism are reduced (Dahlstrom and Nygaard, 1999;Gupta et al., 1987).', 'Likewise, continuous evaluation of the results, as well as implementation of plans, and budgeting systems in the subsidiary, is sometimes required to limit opportunities for shirking (Baliga and Jaeger, 1984).', 'Furthermore, MNC headquarters may try to increase trust between headquarters and subsidiaries (#AUTHOR_TAG, et al., 2011).', 'Trust is normally a result of investment in bonding activities.', 'As our study is cross-sectional, we cannot observe previous investments in bonding for each MNC in our study, but intuitively it seems reasonable that high opportunism may be a result of low bonding investments over time.', 'Trust needs to be built over time and grows when one party starts to behave in a way the other party finds trustworthy (Serva et al., 2005).']	0	['Furthermore, MNC headquarters may try to increase trust between headquarters and subsidiaries (#AUTHOR_TAG, et al., 2011).']
CC2900	52040210	Governance costs in foreign direct investments: A MNC headquarters challenge	Gabriel Benito	When Does Vertical Coordination Improve Industrial Purchasing Relationships?	"[""Arnt Buvik"", ""George John""]"	Vertically coordinated ties are purportedly effective responses to the uncertainties of fastchanging purchasing environments. Building on transaction costs arguments, and related work in marketing, we analyze vertical coordination as a response to external uncertainty. We show that its effectiveness is highly contingent on the magnitude of the safeguarding problem present. Indeed, its beneficial effects can be overwhelmed by the consequential increase in trading hazards. We use survey data from a sample of 161 industrial buyers to test our hypotheses. When specific investments are modest, greater vertical coordination diminishes transaction difficulties in adapting to high environmental uncertainty. On the other hand, vertical coordination increases transaction difficulties in adapting to high environmental uncertainty when specific investments are substantial. We discuss the importance to these results for transaction cost theory. We develop our results into a managerial decision framework for designing purchasing ties that balances safeguarding and adaptation. 2 When Does Vertical Coordination Improve Industrial Purchasing Relationships	In addition, an orthogonal First, we checked whether the confidence interval ( (varimax) rotated factor analysis was carried out to verify the results from the CFA, (#AUTHOR_TAG and John, 2000).

Duflo"", ""S. Mullainathan""]"	Most papers that employ Differences-in-Differences estimation (DD) use many years of data and focus on serially correlated outcomes but ignore that the resulting standard errors are inconsistent. To illustrate the severity of this issue, we randomly generate placebo laws in state-level data on female wages from the Current Population Survey. For each law, we use OLS to compute the DD estimate of its ÒeffectÓ as well as the standard error of this estimate. These conventional DD standard errors severely understate the standard deviation of the estimators: we find an ÒeffectÓ significant at the 5 percent level for up to 45 percent of the placebo interventions. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well existing methods help solve this problem. Econometric corrections that place a specific parametric form on the time-series process do not perform well. Bootstrap (taking into account the auto-correlation of the data) works well when the number of states is large enough. Two corrections based on asymptotic approximation of the variance covariance matrix work well for moderate numbers of states and one correction that collapses the time series information into a ÒpreÓ and ÒpostÓ period and explicitly takes into account the effective sample size works well even for small numbers of states.	Moreover, as the dependent variable displays a strong positive autocorrelation, we follow the most conservative method of estimating standard errors also by clustering at the country level, allowing arbitrary country-specific serial correlation (see #AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2004).

The term by no means exhausts the realm of things psychological, but it does encompass all of an individualÕs direct experience. When we speak of the flow of consciousness we are referring to the changes that take place in consciousness over time. The events of consciousness are, of course, extremely complex and varied. They embrace images in every sensory modality and in every degree of vividness, realism, and believability, including inner dialogue, hallucinations, reveries, and dreamlike sequences; and they also embrace qualities that are at the same time less figured and more pervasive than theseÑthe affects. This chapter focuses on a broad class of these conscious contents. They do not contain the imagery of current perceptual activity but they contain imaginai qualities that one can describe in terms of forms, colors, sounds, words, smells, tastes, temperatures, and the like.

They were used to model HIV progression by accumulation of resistance mutations in the viral genome under drug pressure and cancer progression by accumulation of chromosomal aberrations in tumor cells. From the mixture models a genetic progression score (GPS) can be derived that estimates the genetic status of single patients according to the corresponding progression along the tree models. GPS values were shown to have predictive power for estimating drug resistance in HIV or the survival time in cancer. Still, the reliability of the exact values of such complex markers derived from graphical models can be questioned.In a simulation study, we analyzed various aspects of the stability of estimated mutagenetic trees mixture models. It turned out that the induced probabilistic distributions and the tree topologies are recovered with high precision by an EM-like learning algorithm. However, only for models with just one major model component, also GPS values of single patients can be reliably estimated.It is encouraging that the estimation process of mutagenetic trees mixture models can be performed with high confidence regarding induced probability distributions and the general shape of the tree topologies.

E. MOLNAR"", ""L. F. BERKMAN"", ""S. L. BUKA""]"	Research shows that psychopathology, child sexual abuse and other childhood adversities are risk factors for suicide. However, few have investigated their joint and independent roles in the pursuit of a reliable, predictive model of suicidal behaviour.Data are from the National Comorbidity Survey (N = 5877), a nationally representative study of prevalence, risk factors, and social consequences of psychiatric disorders in the US. Discrete time survival analysis and population attributable risk methodologies were utilized.Among those sexually abused as children, odds of suicide attempts were 2-4 times higher among women and 4-11 times higher among men, compared with those not abused, controlling for other adversities. Odds ratios were reduced but most remained statistically significant after adjusting for lifetime psychiatric illnesses preceding suicide attempts. In the same predictive equation, 79% of serious suicide attempts among women could be attributed to psychiatric disorders while 12% was attributable to rape and 7% to molestation. The highest probability of a first attempt was during early adolescence for those who were sexually abused and had a lifetime disorder, but it was 8-12 years older for those sexually abused without any disorders.In the US, a strong association exists between child sexual abuse and suicidal behaviour, mediated by psychopathology. There is a substantial proportion of suicide risk attributable to child sexual abuse beyond the presence of psychopathology and other adversities. From a clinical standpoint, abuse survivors represent a high-risk population for suicidal behaviour. Further research into this preventable antecedent of suicide attempts is necessary.	Childhood trauma has also been shown to increase the risk for having AVH in adult age (Daalman, Diederen, Derks, van Lutterveld, Kahn & Sommer, 2012;Janssen, Krabbendam, Bak et al., 2004) and may also explain the higher rate of AVH in females as this is more often reported by females (Daalman et al., 2012;Janssen et al., 2004;#AUTHOR_TAG, Berkman & Buka, 2001).

The phenomenon of choice-induced preference change has been of interest to cognitive dissonance researchers in social psychology, and more recently, it has attracted the attention of researchers in economics and neuroscience. Preference modulation after the mere act of making a choice has been repeatedly demonstrated over the last 50 years by an experimental paradigm called the ""free-choice paradigm."" However, Chen and Risen (2010) pointed out a serious methodological flaw in this paradigm, arguing that evidence for choice-induced preference change is still insufficient. Despite the flaw, studies using the traditional free-choice paradigm continue to be published without addressing the criticism. Here, aiming to draw more attention to this issue, we briefly explain the methodological problem, and then describe simple simulation studies that illustrate how the free-choice paradigm produces a systematic pattern of preference change consistent with cognitive dissonance, even without any change in true preference. Our stimulation also shows how a different level of noise in each phase of the free-choice paradigm independently contributes to the magnitude of artificial preference change. Furthermore, we review ways of addressing the critique and provide a meta-analysis to show the effect size of choice-induced preference change after addressing the critique. Finally, we review and discuss, based on the results of the stimulation studies, how the criticism affects our interpretation of past findings generated from the free-choice paradigm. We conclude that the use of the conventional free-choice paradigm should be avoided in future research and the validity of past findings from studies using this paradigm should be empirically re-established."

D. H. M. (1992). Leerstijlen en sturen van leerprocessen in het hoger onderwijs. (Learning styles and guidance of learning processes in higher education) . Amsterdam/Lisse: Swets and Zeitlinger] postulated four different learning styles: a meaning directed, a reproduction directed, an application directed and an undirected style. Aim of this project is to investigate the relation between these learning styles, the big five personality traits and achievement motivation. Subjects were about 900 university students. Extraversion correlated positively with the meaning directed, reproduction directed and application directed learning style. Conscientiousness was associated positively with the meaning, reproduction and application directed learning style, and negatively with the undirected learning style. Openness to experience correlated positively with the meaning and application directed learning style, and negatively with the undirected learning style. Besides, it was found that neuroticism correlated positively with the undirected learning style and negatively with the meaning and reproduction directed learning style. Agreeableness was associated positively with the reproduction and application directed learning style. Positive correlations were found for achievement motivation with the meaning, reproduction and the application directed learning style, and a negative one with the undirected learning style. Regression analyses confirmed these patterns. Although there was some systematic overlap for the four learning styles with personality variables and achievement motivation, the conclusion is that it certainly makes sense to measure these three groups of variables separately in educational settings.	Openness, conscientiousness, and intrinsic motivation are correlated with a deep learning approach, while neuroticism, agreeableness, and extrinsic motivation are associated with a shallow learning approach (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1999;Duff et al., 2004;Marton & S�_lj�_, 2005).

However, any correspondence to biogeochemical change was not noticed yet. Here, we present indirect evidences of denitrification in response to a global warming and estimate the amount of denitrification by the linear inverse model. N/P ratio of the East Sea below 300m is estimated as 12.4, quite lower than the Redfield ratio of 16. Intense N/P ratio and oxygen minimum zones are founded between 900m and 2200m in the Ulleung Basin. Two stations are strongly expected to occur denitrification, where is located within the Ulleung Basin, show a series of phenomena at specific depths that nitrate profile is reversed, N/P ratio is less than 12.4, and nitrite shows a peak. Evidently, these results indicate that denitrification is occurring in the East Sea, in particular, in the Ulleung Basin. Through linear inverse modeling, the mean flux of denitrification in the UB is estimated as 9.0 ~ 16.0 daymmol   -2u, and the mean rate is ranged from 144 1035.11~1038.6 -x x dmol. However, note that the East Sea is still high concentration in oxygen compared with the condition denitrified.

Many patients with chronic heart failure are often fragile elderly with co-morbidities and functional decline due to increased symptom burden. A structured Gothenburg person-centred care (gPCC) approach may promote better discharge-planning.To evaluate whether proactive care-planning based on the gPCC model leads to improved efficiency in discharge procedures compared with usual care in patients hospitalized for worsening chronic heart failure.In a controlled before-and-after design, patients hospitalized for worsening chronic heart failure were assigned to either a usual care group or a gPCC intervention group. The patients' social situation, their discharge destination and the number of days until the discharge were recorded. The time interval (in days) between notification and start of coordination of care was recorded.In total, 248 patients were included, 123 in the usual care group and 125 in the gPCC intervention. During hospitalization, notifications to the community home help service and/or round-the-clock home nursing care services were more frequent in the gPCC-group (33.8%) compared with patients in the usual care group (12.1%). A confirmed discharge planning conference started within the first five days in the gPCC group whereas the usual care group ranged from one to 28 days. Compared with the usual care group, the gPCC group had fewer days in hospital (11 versus 35) ready for discharge.gPCC improves discharge processes because patients are viewed as competent to be involved in planning their subsequent care.(c) The European Society of Cardiology 2015.

Little is known about the frequency and characteristics of end-of-life decisions in this population, nor about the relation with clinical and patients' characteristics. METHODS: A death-certificate study was done for all deaths of neonates and infants in the whole of Flanders over a 12 month period (August, 1999, to July, 2000). We sent an anonymous questionnaire by mail to the attending physician for each of the 292 children who died under the age of 1 year. Information on patients was obtained from national registers. An attitude study was done for all physicians who attended at least one death during the study period. FINDINGS: 253 (87%) of the 292 questionnaires were returned, and 121 (69%) of the 175 physicians involved completed the attitude questions. An end-of-life decision was possible in 194 (77%; 95% CI 70.4-82.4) of the 253 deaths studied, and such a decision was made in 143 cases (57%; 48.9-64.0).

The objective of the Task Force is to assess the degree of palliative care development in the European Region as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). The Task Force is a collaboration between EAPC, the International Observatory on End of Life Care, Help the Hospices and the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care. The University of Navarra have collaborated in the dissemination of results and is involved in further developments of this group. Four studies, each with different working methods, made up the study protocol: a literature review, a review of all the existing palliative care directories in Europe, a qualitative ;Eurobarometer' survey and a quantitative ;Facts Questionnaire' survey. The work of the Task Force covers the entire WHO European Region of 52 countries. In this article we present a comparative study on the development of palliative care in Europe, drawing on all four elements of the study. Different models of service delivery have been developed and implemented throughout the countries of Europe. For example, in addition to the UK, the countries of Germany, Austria, Poland and Italy have a well-developed and extensive network of hospices. The model for mobile teams or hospital support teams has been adopted in a number of countries, most notably in France. Day Centres are a development that is characteristic of the UK with hundreds of these services currently in operation. The number of beds per million inhabitants ranges between 45-75 beds in the most advanced European countries, to only a few beds in others. Estimates on the number of physicians working full time in palliative care are shown. The countries with the highest development of palliative care in their respective subregions as measured in terms of ratio of services per one million inhabitants are: Western Europe - UK (15); Central and Eastern Europe - Poland (9); Commonwealth of Independent States - Armenia (8). This paper also presents indicators on the development of palliative care based on the bibliometric analysis of scientific journals and on the vitality of the palliative care movement in each country.	That Belgium is one of the countries with the most developed palliative care systems (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2007;Chambaere et al. 2011a;) and the third country to have legally regulated euthanasia 5 is not paradoxical, as we have tried to make clear above, but it may also not be accidental.

While much lower prices seem to be attainable in the future due to learning curve cost reductions that increase rapidly with the scale of diffusion of the technology, there is a chicken and egg problem, even when some consumers may be willing to pay more for green technologies. Drawing on recent percolation models of diffusion by Solomon et al. [7], Frenken et al. [8] and Hohnisch et al. [9], we develop a network model of new technology diffusion that combines contagion among consumers with heterogeneity of agent characteristics. Agents adopt when the price falls below their random reservation price drawn from a lognormal distribution, but only when one of their neighbors has already adopted. Combining with a learning curve for the price as a function of the cumulative number of adopters, this may lead to delayed adoption for a certain range of initial conditions. Using agent-based simulations we explore when a limited subsidy policy can trigger diffusion that would otherwise not happen. The introduction of a subsidy policy seems to be highly effective for a given high initial price level only for learning economies in a certain range. Outside this range, the diffusion of a new technology either never takes off despite the subsidies, or the subsidies are unnecessary. Perhaps not coincidentally, this range seems to correspond to the values observed for many successful innovations.Innovation diffusion, learning economies, percolation, networks, heterogeneous agents, technology subsidies, environmental technologies	Technological uncertainties have been studied using a wide range of tools, including energy system models [6,7], system dynamics and agent-based models [9,#AUTHOR_TAG], and a number of techno-economic studies [11], and are relatively well characterized.

CC331	81867052	Information of the chassis and information of the program in synthetic cells	Antoine Danchin	A synthetic biology approach to the construction of membrane proteins in semi-synthetic minimal cells	"[""H ; Judson"", "" Simon"", ""New Schuster"", ""Y York Kuruma"", ""P Stano"", ""T Ueda"", ""P L Luisi""]"	Synthetic biology is an emerging field that aims at constructing artificial biological systems by combining engineering and molecular biology approaches. One of the most ambitious research line concerns the so-called semi-synthetic minimal cells, which are liposome-based system capable of synthesizing the lipids within the liposome surface. This goal can be reached by reconstituting membrane proteins within liposomes and allow them to synthesize lipids. This approach, that can be defined as biochemical, was already reported by us (Schmidli et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 8127-8130, 1991). In more advanced models, however, a full reconstruction of the biochemical pathway requires (1) the synthesis of functional membrane enzymes inside liposomes, and (2) the local synthesis of lipids as catalyzed by the in situ synthesized enzymes. Here we show the synthesis and the activity--inside liposomes--of two membrane proteins involved in phospholipids biosynthesis pathway. The proteins, sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT), have been synthesized by using a totally reconstructed cell-free system (PURE system) encapsulated in liposomes. The activities of internally synthesized GPAT and LPAAT were confirmed by detecting the produced lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid, respectively. Through this procedure, we have implemented the first phase of a design aimed at synthesizing phospholipid membrane from liposome within from within - which corresponds to the autopoietic growth mechanism.	This dichotomy is visible in present synthetic biology, with a fairly clear separation between those who study the chassis (and are often also interested in the origin of life) (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009;Shenhav and Lancet 2004) and those who think that life is essentially due to the genetic program, organising their activity around construction of program biobricks, or even as complete genomes (Gibson et al. 2008).

CC1457	54847651	Intuitive and Reflective Responses in Philosophy	Nick Byrd	Inductive judgments about natural categories	"[""Lance J. Rips""]"	The present study examined the effects of semantic structure on simple inductive judgments about category members. For a particular category (e.g., mammals), subjects were told that one of the species (e.g., horses) had a given property (an unknown disease) and were asked to estimate the proportion of instances in the other species that possessed the property. The results indicated that category structureÑin particular, the typicality of the speciesÑinfluenced subjects' judgments. These results were interpreted by models based on the following assumption: When little is known about the underlying distribution of a property, subjects assume that the distribution mirrors that of better-known properties. For this reason, if subjects learn that an unknown property is possessed by a typical species (i.e., one that shares many of its properties with other category members), they are more likely to generalize than if the same fact had been learned about an atypical species.

CC1708	54009105	The Effect of Desflurane on Neuronal Communication at a Central Synapse	Jonathan Mapelli	High-fidelity transmission of sensory information by single cerebellar mossy fibre boutons	"[""Ede A. Rancz"", ""Taro Ishikawa"", ""Ian Duguid"", ""Paul Chadderton"", ""S\u00e9verine Mahon"", ""Michael H\u00e4usser""]"	Understanding the transmission of sensory information at individual synaptic connections requires knowledge of the properties of presynaptic terminals and their patterns of firing evoked by sensory stimuli. Such information has been difficult to obtain because of the small size and inaccessibility of nerve terminals in the central nervous system. Here we show, by making direct patch-clamp recordings in vivo from cerebellar mossy fibre boutons-the primary source of synaptic input to the cerebellar cortex-that sensory stimulation can produce bursts of spikes in single boutons at very high instantaneous firing frequencies (more than 700 Hz). We show that the mossy fibre-granule cell synapse exhibits high-fidelity transmission at these frequencies, indicating that the rapid burst of excitatory postsynaptic currents underlying the sensory-evoked response of granule cells can be driven by such a presynaptic spike burst. We also demonstrate that a single mossy fibre can trigger action potential bursts in granule cells in vitro when driven with in vivo firing patterns. These findings suggest that the relay from mossy fibre to granule cell can act in a 'detonator' fashion, such that a single presynaptic afferent may be sufficient to transmit the sensory message. This endows the cerebellar mossy fibre system with remarkable sensitivity and high fidelity in the transmission of sensory information.	The cerebellar granular layer microcircuit allows to obtain MI quantification between mf and GrCs because: i) mf inputs are conveyed through high-frequency bursts (up to 500Hz [38,#AUTHOR_TAG]) that have been well characterized, enabling a proper representation of the input space [30,40]; ii) in cerebellar slices GrCs are silent when mf are severed, reducing spontaneous firing and output variability; iii) in response to mf activation, GrCs generate only few spikes (typically less than 3-4) with a maximum output frequency of 100-150 Hz, reducing the output response space.

Questionnaires about continuous deep sedation and other decisions were sent to the certifying physicians of each death from a stratified sample (Flanders, BE: n=6927; NL: n=6860). In the U.K. in 2007-2008, questionnaires were sent to 8857 randomly sampled physicians asking them about the last death attended.The total number of deaths studied was 11,704 of which 1517 involved continuous deep sedation. In Dutch hospitals, continuous deep sedation was significantly less often provided (11%) compared with hospitals in Flanders, BE (20%) and the U.K. (17%). In U.K. home settings, continuous deep sedation was more common (19%) than in Flanders, BE (10%) or NL (8%). In NL in both settings, continuous deep sedation more often involved benzodiazepines and lasted less than 24 hours. Physicians in Flanders combined continuous deep sedation with a decision to provide physician-assisted death more often. Overall, men, younger patients, and patients with malignancies were more likely to receive continuous deep sedation, although this was not always significant within each country.Differences in the prevalence of continuous deep sedation appear to reflect complex legal, cultural, and organizational factors more than differences in patients' characteristics or clinical profiles.

CC1177	82852800	Goal Commitments and the content of thoughts and dreams: basic principles	Eric Klinger	Evaluative and generative modes of thought during the creative process	"[""Melissa Ellamil"", ""Charles Dobson"", ""Mark Beeman"", ""Kalina Christoff""]"	Psychological theories have suggested that creativity involves a twofold process characterized by a generative component facilitating the production of novel ideas and an evaluative component enabling the assessment of their usefulness. The present study employed a novel fMRI paradigm designed to distinguish between these two components at the neural level. Participants designed book cover illustrations while alternating between the generation and evaluation of ideas. The use of an fMRI-compatible drawing tablet allowed for a more natural drawing and creative environment. Creative generation was associated with preferential recruitment of medial temporal lobe regions, while creative evaluation was associated with joint recruitment of executive and default network regions and activation of the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, and temporopolar cortex. Executive and default regions showed positive functional connectivity throughout task performance. These findings suggest that the medial temporal lobe may be central to the generation of novel ideas and creative evaluation may extend beyond deliberate analytical processes supported by executive brain regions to include more spontaneous affective and visceroceptive evaluative processes supported by default and limbic regions. Thus, creative thinking appears to recruit a unique configuration of neural processes not typically used together during traditional problem solving tasks.Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Evidence is, however, mixed concerning the role of personality traits in predicting such success. The current study attempted to overcome various methodological limitations associated with many previous studies to examine the potency of the traits of the `five factor model of personality' in predicting academic success up to 3 years later, both directly and when controlling for intelligence and `application' (used as a proxy for motivation). Only two traits yielded significant zero-order correlations with eventual undergraduate success, with both Openness to experience and Agreeableness being positively associated with Final Grades. Openness to experience explained unique variance in Final Grades even when predicting in the company of intellect and application measures. The impact of Agreeableness on Final Grades was wholly mediated by the main application measure; namely, not missing seminars. Less than one fifth of Final Grade variance was explained by all the individual difference variables in combination.

Oppenheimer"", ""Nicholas Epley"", ""Rebecca N. Eyre""]"	Humans appear to reason using two processing styles: System 1 processes that are quick, intuitive, and effortless and System 2 processes that are slow, analytical, and deliberate that occasionally correct the output of System 1. Four experiments suggest that System 2 processes are activated by metacognitive experiences of difficulty or disfluency during the process of reasoning. Incidental experiences of difficulty or disfluency--receiving information in a degraded font (Experiments 1 and 4), in difficult-to-read lettering (Experiment 2), or while furrowing one's brow (Experiment 3)--reduced the impact of heuristics and defaults in judgment (Experiments 1 and 3), reduced reliance on peripheral cues in persuasion (Experiment 2), and improved syllogistic reasoning (Experiment 4). Metacognitive experiences of difficulty or disfluency appear to serve as an alarm that activates analytic forms of reasoning that assess and sometimes correct the output of more intuitive forms of reasoning.	A view that might be consistent with more than one of these characterizations is the view that people tend to be satisfied with their intuitive responses unless they sense some indication of difficulty about the task, in which case they might rely on a more reflective response (#AUTHOR_TAG et al 2007, Simmons and Nelson 2006, Thompson and Johnson 2014.

Li""]"	"We present the results of a thorough parameter study of coronal loop models in the aim to explore the mechanism behind coronal heating. The two-fluid coronal loops described in this paper have lengths from 10 Mm to 600 Mm and consist of protons and electrons. The loops are treated with our unique, self-consistent, steady state dynamic loop model to derive the basic parameters (as introduced by Li & Habbal 2003, ApJ, 598, L125). The only heating mechanism assumed is turbulently generated AlfvŽn waves that carry the necessary flux from the chromosphere to energize the coronal plasma through preferential heating of the proton gas. Strong Coulomb coupling allows energy to pass efficiently from protons to electrons. We have control over the independent variables, driving scale (l) and AlfvŽn amplitude (_), which influence the dissipation and flux of these resonant waves. We find ""mapping"" the loop parameter response to varying l with fixed _ a useful tool to find where certain conditions for each loop length exist. From this, we are able to pin-point where the coldest solution lies. For a loop of L=10 Mm, the coolest loops have a maximum temperature of T=0.75 MK. We also focus on a L=40 Mm loop and vary both l and _ so we can compare results with existing work. From this parameter mapping we can categorise the loop heating profiles. Our model indicates the existence of footpoint, non-uniformly and quasi-uniformly heated profiles. There is also strong evidence to suggest the same mechanism may apply to hot, SXT loops."

The feed quota made the Norwegian and world supply curves for salmon less price elastic. This contributed to price instability, magnified the downward pressure on world salmon prices associated with the 71% increase in supplies of farmed salmon from Chile between 2000 and 2002, and increased NorwayÕs incidence of US salmon tariffs. Our analysis suggests these unintended consequences of the feed quota policy are nontrivial, amounting to some $62 million in lost surplus to UK producers between 2000 and 2002, equivalent to 9.5% of export value.

CC383	82854584	Psychotherapy and brain plasticity	Daniel Collerton	The Dodo Bird Verdict-controversial, inevitable and important: a commentary on 30 years of meta-analyses	"[""Rick Budd"", ""Ian Hughes""]"	In this article, the assertion that different psychological therapies are of broadly similar efficacy-often called the 'Dodo Bird Verdict'-is contrasted with the alternative view that there are specific therapies that are more effective than others for particular diagnoses. We note that, despite thirty years of meta-analytic reviews tending to support the finding of therapy equivalence, this view is still controversial and has not been accepted by many within the psychological therapy community; we explore this from a theory of science perspective. It is further argued that the equivalence of ostensibly different therapies is an inevitable consequence of the methodology that has dominated this field of investigation; namely, randomised controlled trials [RCTs]. The implicit assumptions of RCTs are analysed and it is argued that what we know about psychological therapy indicates that it is not appropriate to treat 'type of therapy' and 'diagnosis' as if they were independent variables in an experimental design. It is noted that one logical consequence of this is that we would not expect RCTs to be capable of isolating effects that are specific to 'type of therapy' and 'diagnosis'. Rather, RCTs would only be expected to be capable of identifying the non-specific effects of covariates, such as those of therapist allegiance. It is further suggested that those non-specific effects that have been identified via meta-analysis are not trivial findings, but rather characterise important features of psychological therapy.	The outcomes of psychodynamic, personcentred, and behavioral psychotherapy are broadly equivalent despite their varieties of approaches and targets for therapeutic change (Stiles et al., 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG and Hughes, 2009) perhaps because they work via common final paths (Mansell, 2011).

Methods: A cross-sectional survey of adolescents aged 14-19 years studying at different educational institutions of Karachi, Pakistan was conducted through multistage sampling on a pre-tested self-administered questionnaire. They were divided into high, middle and lower socioeconomic strata on the basis of monthly fee structure. The impact of health messages was assessed two months after education sessions through post-test of only high and middle socioeconomic strata. Results: A total of 646 students were surveyed for the pre test and 250 students for the post test. A significant association was found for water pipe smoking among the socioeconomic class (p < 0.001). Water pipe is more addictive as compared to cigarettes was marked by more students after the sessions (54% vs 68%; p < 0.001). A significant difference was seen for water pipe being more socially acceptable (58% vs 80%; p < 0.001), it is part of our cultural heritage (29% vs 58%; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Shisha smoking was more prevalent among the high socio economic group, which might be because of the cost, accessibility and availability.

Linscott"", ""I. Myin-Germeys"", ""P. Delespaul"", ""L. Krabbendam""]"	A systematic review of all reported incidence and prevalence studies of population rates of subclinical psychotic experiences reveals a median prevalence rate of around 5% and a median incidence rate of around 3%. A meta-analysis of risk factors reveals associations with developmental stage, child and adult social adversity, psychoactive drug use, and also male sex and migrant status. The small difference between prevalence and incidence rates, together with data from follow-up studies, indicates that approximately 75-90% of developmental psychotic experiences are transitory and disappear over time. There is evidence, however, that transitory developmental expression of psychosis (psychosis proneness) may become abnormally persistent (persistence) and subsequently clinically relevant (impairment), depending on the degree of environmental risk the person is additionally exposed to. The psychosis proneness-persistence-impairment model considers genetic background factors impacting on a broadly distributed and transitory population expression of psychosis during development, poor prognosis of which, in terms of persistence and clinical need, is predicted by environmental exposure interacting with genetic risk.

Thomas Vanoutrive	Smarter Choices: Assessing the Potential to Achieve Traffic Reduction Using â€˜Soft Measuresâ€™	"[""S. Cairns"", ""L. Sloman"", ""C. Newson"", ""J. Anable"", ""A. Kirkbride"", ""P. Goodwin""]"	In recent years, there has been a growing interest in a range of transport policy initiatives which are designed to influence peopleÕs travel behaviour away from single_occupancy car use and towards more benign and efficient options, through a combination of marketing, information, incentives and tailored new services. In transport policy discussions, these are now widely described as ÔsoftÕ factor interventions or Ôsmarter choiceÕ measures or Ômobility managementÕ tools. In 2004, the UK Department for Transport commissioned a major study to examine whether large_scale programmes of these measures could potentially deliver substantial cuts in car use. The purpose of this article is to clarify the approach taken in the study, the types of evidence reviewed and the overall conclusions reached. In summary, the results suggested that, within approximately ten years, smarter choice measures have the potential to reduce national traffic levels by about 11%, with reductions of up to 21% of peak period urban traffic. Moreover, they represent relatively good value for money, with schemes potentially generating benefit:cost ratios which are in excess of 10:1. The central conclusion of the study was that such measures could play a very significant role in addressing traffic, given the right support and policy context.

At low temperature, our calculation indicates that the rhombohedral R-3C phase is the most energetically stable structure among the three proposed structures: R-3C (No. 167), R-3M (No. 166), and R3C (No. 161). It is found that the LaAlO <sub>3</sub> transforms from rhombohedral R-3C phase to cubic PM-3M phase with a volume change of 1% when the applied hydrostatic pressure is 15.4 GPa, which is consistent with the experimental value. The elastic constants, shear modulus, bulk modulus, and PoissonÕs ratio of LaAlO <sub>3</sub> are calculated and compared with corresponding experimental data. Our result shows that the rotation of the AlO <sub>6</sub> octahedra in LaAlO <sub>3</sub> has a large influence on the anisotropic elastic constants. From the calculated Debye temperature and elastic constants, the R-3C phase of LaAlO <sub>3</sub> is predicted to be more thermostable and to exhibit higher fracture toughness than the high-pressured PM-3M phase.

CC602	82403724	Life, hierarchy, and the thermodynamic machinery of planet Earth	Axel Kleidon	MEP and planetary climates: insights from a two-box climate model containing atmospheric dynamics	"[""Tim E. Jupp"", ""Peter M. Cox""]"	A two-box model for equator-to-pole planetary heat transport is extended to include simple atmospheric dynamics. The surface drag coefficient CD is treated as a free parameter and solutions are calculated analytically in terms of the dimensionless planetary parameters eta (atmospheric thickness), omega (rotation rate) and xi (advective capability). Solutions corresponding to maximum entropy production (MEP) are compared with solutions previously obtained from dynamically unconstrained two-box models. As long as the advective capability xi is sufficiently large, dynamically constrained MEP solutions are identical to dynamically unconstrained MEP solutions. Consequently, the addition of a dynamical constraint does not alter the previously obtained MEP results for Earth, Mars and Titan, and an analogous result is presented here for Venus. The rate of entropy production in an MEP state is shown to be independent of rotation rate if the advective capability xi is sufficiently large (as for the four examples in the solar system), or if the rotation rate omega is sufficiently small. The model indicates, however, that the dynamical constraint does influence the MEP state when xi is small, which might be the case for some extrasolar planets. Finally, results from the model developed here are compared with previous numerical simulations in which the effect of varying surface drag coefficient on entropy production was calculated.	Since then, further work has shown that MEP yields reasonable predictions of hemispheric heat transport on other planetary bodies [14,73] and of empirical friction coefficients in atmospheric general circulation models [15,74], but also for vertical convection [71,75,49,37,51,#AUTHOR_TAG] and convection at hydrothermal vents at the seafloor [77].

CC350	81867052	Information of the chassis and information of the program in synthetic cells	Antoine Danchin	The Origins of Life	"[""F J Dyson""]"	A number of features of living systems: reversible interactions and weak bonds underlying motor-dynamics; gel-sol transitions; cellular connected fractal organization; asymmetry in interactions and organization; quantum coherent phenomena; to name some, can have a natural accounting via $physical$ interactions, which we therefore seek to incorporate by expanding the horizons of `chemistry-only' approaches to the origins of life. It is suggested that the magnetic 'face' of the minerals from the inorganic world, recognized to have played a pivotal role in initiating Life, may throw light on some of these issues. A magnetic environment in the form of rocks in the Hadean Ocean could have enabled the accretion and therefore an ordered confinement of super-paramagnetic colloids within a structured phase. A moderate H-field can help magnetic nano-particles to not only overcome thermal fluctuations but also harness them. Such controlled dynamics brings in the possibility of accessing quantum effects, which together with frustrations in magnetic ordering and hysteresis (a natural mechanism for a primitive memory) could throw light on the birth of biological information which, as Abel argues, requires a combination of order and complexity. This scenario gains strength from observations of scale-free framboidal forms of the greigite mineral, with a magnetic basis of assembly.

CC1557	56362892	The bonding effects of relationship value and switching costs in industrial buyer-seller relationships: An investigation into role differences	Ingmar Geiger	The Economic Institutions of Capitalism. Firms, Markets, Relational Contracting	"[""Oliver E. Williamson""]"	This study is based on the belief that economic organization is shaped by transaction cost economizing decisions. It sets out the basic principles of transaction cost economics, applies the basic arguments to economic institutions, and develops public policy implications. Any issue that arises, or can be recast as a matter of contracting, is usefully examined in terms of transaction costs. Transaction cost economics maintains that governance of contractual relations is mainly achieved through institutions of private ordering instead of legal centralism. This approach is based on behavioral assumptions of bounded rationalism and opportunism, which reflect actual human nature. These assumptions underlie the problem of economic organization: to create contract and governance structures that economize on bounded rationality while safeguarding transactions against the hazards of opportunism. The book first summarizes the transaction cost economics approach to the study of economic organization. It develops the underlying behavioral assumptions and the types of transactions; alternative approaches to the world of contracts are presented. Assuming that firms are best regarded as a governance structure, a comparative institutional approach to the governance of contractual relations is set out. The evidence, theory, and policy of vertical integration are discussed, on the basis that the decision to integrate is paradigmatic to transaction cost analysis. The incentives and bureaucratic limits of internal organization are presented, including the dilemma of why a large firm can't do everything a collection of small firms can do. The economics of organization in presented in terms of transaction costs, showing that hierarchy also serves efficiency and permits a variety of predictions about the organization of work. Efficient labor organization is explored; on the assumption that an authority relation prevails between workers and managers, what governance structure supports will be made in response to various types of job attributes are discussed, and implications for union organization are developed. Considering antitrust ramifications of transaction cost economics, the book summarizes transaction cost issues that arise in the context of contracting, merger, and strategic behavior, and challenges earlier antitrust preoccupation with monopoly.

CC2868	52040210	Governance costs in foreign direct investments: A MNC headquarters challenge	Gabriel Benito	The hypermodern MNCâ€”A heterarchy?	"[""Gunnar Hedlund""]"	The hypermodern multinational corporation (MNC) is meant to convey the suspicion that some crucial aspects of developments of and in MNCs cannot be grasped by notions in the merely 'modern' schools of thought. The heterarchical MNC covers a particular brand of geocentric company, which differs significantly from a version that is likely to develop more rapidly in immediate future. Ethnocentric, companies are managed by home country people, and with time there is a lot of rotations between headquarter (HQ) and subsidiaries. The control style will vary in accordance with practice in the parent company and parent country. This chapter examines 'hierarchy' as one governance mode in geocentric firms. The heterarchical MNC differs from standard geocentric one both in terms of strategy and in terms of structure. Strategically, the main dividing line is between exploiting competitive advantages derived from a home country base on the one hand, and actively seeking advantages originating in the global spread of the firm on other.

Samples for study were chosen from six sites along a 2-km-long transect representing different types of arctic vegetation. The influence of temperature, soil water content, and light intensity on acetylene reduction rates was studied. Samples from all sites showed low and almost constant acetylene reduction rates between 0 and 10¡C. Above 10¡C the activity of all samples increased rapidly and reached its maximum at about 25 and 32¡C for the samples with free-living cyanobacteria and moss-associated cyanobacteria, respectively. There was a significant water-dependent increase of acetylene reduction activity for all types of vegetation. The samples showed a clear response to varying light conditions, i.e. a rapid decrease in acetylene reduction rates when light intensity decreased from 140 to 80 _mol mÐ2 sÐl depending on the type of vegetation.

Bruce"", ""Kimberly A. Yonkers"", ""Michael W. Otto"", ""Jane L. Eisen"", ""Risa B. Weisberg"", ""Maria Pagano"", ""M. Tracie Shea"", ""Martin B. Keller""]"	The authors sought to observe the long-term clinical course of anxiety disorders over 12 years and to examine the influence of comorbid psychiatric disorders on recovery from or recurrence of panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia.Data were drawn from the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Disorders Research Program, a prospective, naturalistic, longitudinal, multicenter study of adults with a current or past history of anxiety disorders. Probabilities of recovery and recurrence were calculated by using standard survival analysis methods. Proportional hazards regression analyses with time-varying covariates were conducted to determine risk ratios for possible comorbid psychiatric predictors of recovery and recurrence.Survival analyses revealed an overall chronic course for the majority of the anxiety disorders. Social phobia had the smallest probability of recovery after 12 years of follow-up. Moreover, patients who had prospectively observed recovery from their intake anxiety disorder had a high probability of recurrence over the follow-up period. The overall clinical course was worsened by several comorbid psychiatric conditions, including major depression and alcohol and other substance use disorders, and by comorbidity of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder with agoraphobia.These data depict the anxiety disorders as insidious, with a chronic clinical course, low rates of recovery, and relatively high probabilities of recurrence. The presence of particular comorbid psychiatric disorders significantly lowered the likelihood of recovery from anxiety disorders and increased the likelihood of their recurrence. The findings add to the understanding of the nosology and treatment of these disorders.

The sample comprised 9702 Norwegian adolescents (born 1993Ð1995, 54.9% girls), mainly attending highschool. A set of statistical analyses were run to investigate the dimensionality of the SMFQ. Girls scored significantly higher than boys on the SMFQ and used the most severe response-category far more frequently. Overall, the statistical analyses supported the essential unidimensionality of SMFQ. However, the items with the highest loadings according to the bifactor analysis, reflecting problems related to tiredness, restlessness and concentration difficulties, indicated that some of the symptoms may both be independent of and part of the symptomatology of depression. Measurement invariance analysis showed that girls scored slightly higher on some items when taking the latent variable into account; girls had a lower threshold for reporting mood problems and problems related to tiredness than boys, who showed a marginally lower threshold for reporting that no-one loved them. However, the effect on the total SMFQ score was marginal, supporting the use of the Norwegian translation of SMFQ as a continuous variable in further studies of adolescents.

CC1273	93144659	A Review of Psychometric Data Analysis and Applications	Geraldine Gray	Integrating Theories of Motivation	"[""Piers Steel"", ""Cornelius J. K\u00f6nig""]"	Self-control is a burgeoning research topic within sport and motivational psychology. Following efforts to define and contextualize self-control, characteristics of self-control are considered that have important implications for sport performance. We describe and evaluate various theoretical perspectives on self-control, including limited resources, shifting priorities, and opportunity-costs. The research described includes sport-specific research but also studies that focus on general motivational principles that look beyond sport-specific phenomena. We propose that attentional, rather than limited resource, explanations of self-control have more value for athletic performance. Moreover, we integrate self-control ideas with descriptions of motivational phenomena to derive novel hypotheses concerning how self-control can be optimized during sport performance. We explain how minimizing desire-goal conflicts by fusing self-control processes and performance goals can delay aversive consequences of self-control that may impede performance. We also suggest that autonomous performance goals are an important motivational input that enhances the effectiveness of self-control processes by a) reducing the salience of the desire to reduce performance-related discomfort, b) increasing attentional resources towards optimal performance, and c) optimizing monitoring and modification of self-control processes. These extensions to knowledge help map out empirical agenda which may drive theoretical advances and deepen understanding of how to improve self-control during performance	Defining how learners are motivated to behave in a certain way, and more specifically to learn, is more complex, and is characterized by a range of complementary theories that aim to explain both the level of individual motivation and the nature of the motivation (#AUTHOR_TAG & Konig, 2006).

We analyze in great detail the optical lattice generated by the coherent superposition of three coplanar running laser waves with respective angles 2{pi}/3. The corresponding band structure displays Dirac cones located at the corners of the Brillouin zone and close to half-filling this system is well described by massless Dirac fermions. We characterize their properties by accurately deriving the nearest-neighbor hopping parameter t{sub 0} as a function of the optical lattice parameters. Our semiclassical instanton method proves in excellent agreement with an exact numerical diagonalization of the full Hamilton operator in the tight-binding regime. We conclude that the temperature range needed to access the Dirac fermions regime is within experimental reach. We also analyze imperfections in the laser configuration as they lead to optical lattice distortions which affect the Dirac fermions. We show that the Dirac cones do survive up to some critical intensity or angle mismatches which are easily controlled in actual experiments. In the tight-binding regime, we predict, and numerically confirm, that these critical mismatches are inversely proportionalmore >> to the square root of the optical potential strength. We also briefly discuss the interesting possibility of fine tuning the mass of the Dirac fermions by controlling the laser phase in an optical lattice generated by the incoherent superposition of three coplanar independent standing waves with respective angles 2{pi}/3.<< less	"where the Bloch vector (k x , k y ) sits in the first We note that this dispersion relation gives rise to two 'Dirac points"" for (k x , k y ) = (����/2d x , ��/2d y ) around which the dispersion relation is linear [13,48] (see also [49,50,51,#AUTHOR_TAG,53] for discussions of the Dirac points occurring in different settings, such as hexagonal lattices or non-Abelian gauge fields)."

Keith Chen"", ""Jane L. Risen""]"	"After making a choice between two objects, people evaluate their chosen item higher and their rejected item lower (i.e., they ""spread "" the alternatives). Since Brehm's (1956) initial free-choice experiment, psychologists have interpreted the spreading of alternatives as evidence for choice-induced attitude change. It is widely assumed to occur because choosing creates cognitive dissonance, which is then reduced through rationalization. In this paper, we express concern with this interpretation, noting that the free-choice paradigm (FCP) will produce spreading, even if people's attitudes remain unchanged. Specifically, if people's ratings/rankings are an imperfect measure of their preferences, and their choices are at least partially guided by their preferences, then the FCP will measure spreading, even if people's preferences remain perfectly stable. We show this, first, by proving a mathematical theorem that identifies a set of conditions under which the FCP will measure spreading, even absent attitude change. We then experimentally demonstrate that these conditions appear to hold, and that the FCP measures a spread of alternatives, even when this spreading cannot have been caused by choice. We discuss how the problem we identify applies to the basic FCP paradigm as well as to all variants that examine moderators and mediators of spreading. The results suggest a reassessment of the free-choice paradigm, and perhaps, the conclusions that have been drawn from it"	One paradigm demonstrating how choice affects preferences is the free-choice paradigm wherein value judgements are gathered on options before and after subjects are forced to choose one and reject the other option [#AUTHOR_TAG,7].

CC1792	30730382	Beyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific Explanation	Richard Cooper	PrÃ©cis of Unified Theories of Cognition	"[""A Newell""]"	The book presents the case that cognitive science should turn its attention to developing theories of human cognition that cover the full range of human perceptual, cognitive, and action phenomena. Cognitive science has now produced a massive number of high-quality regularities with many microtheories that reveal important mechanisms. The need for integration is pressing and will continue to increase. Equally important, cognitive science now has the theoretical concepts and tools to support serious attempts at unified theories. The argument is made entirely by presenting an exemplar unified theory of cognition both to show what a real unified theory would be like and to provide convincing evidence that such theories are feasible. The exemplar is SOAR, a cognitive architecture, which is realized as a software system. After a detailed discussion of the architecture and its properties, with its relation to the constraints on cognition in the real world and to existing ideas in cognitive science, SOAR is used as theory for a wide range of cognitive phenomena: immediate responses (stimulus-response compatibility and the Sternberg phenomena); discrete motor skills (transcription typing); memory and learning (episodic memory and the acquisition of skill through practice); problem solving (cryptarithmetic puzzles and syllogistic reasoning); language (sentence verification and taking instructions); and development (transitions in the balance beam task). The treatments vary in depth and adequacy, but they clearly reveal a single, highly specific, operational theory that works over the entire range of human cognition, SOAR is presented as an exemplar unified theory, not as the sole candidate. Cognitive science is not ready yet for a single theory - there must be multiple attempts. But cognitive science must begin to work toward such unified theories.	One can make many arguments for the utility of developing cognitive models within a cognitive architecture (see, e.g., Cassimatis, Bell, & Langley, 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG, 1990), but adopting the concept of cognitive architecture is in fact highly consistent with Marr's original approach to vision.

In the United States, bioethical experts in these institutions use the language of consensus building to justify and define the outcome of the enterprise. However, the implications of public bioethics at science-policy boundaries are underexamined. Political interest in such bodies continues while their influence on societal consensus, public debate, and science policy remains ambiguous. This article presents a theoretical discussion of public bioethics bodies as boundary organizations and examines them in terms of relationship to the moral and cognitive authority of science and other forms of expertise, mechanisms for public participation in controversial science policy, and the deployment of consensus models.

A Systematic Review of the Qualitative Evidence	Andrea Smith	The Phenomenon of Self-Change: Overview and Key Issues	"[""Linda Carter Sobell""]"	For years, the addiction field has been dominated by an almost exclusive focus on individuals who are severely dependent. If substance use problems are viewed as lying along a continuum ranging from no problems to mild problems to severe problems, rather than as dichotomous (i.e., alcoholic versus not alcoholic, drug addict versus not drug addict) it has profound implications for how one views and treats such individuals. One implication is that there are multiple pathways to recovery, including self-change, a pathway that has largely been ignored by the addiction field. This first chapter has several objectives, most notably to help readers understand where the field is currently and where it is headed.

CC215	39414524	The Productivity of Working Hours	John Pencavel	Hours of Work and Hours of Leisure	"[""H G Lewis""]"	We examine how openness interacts with the coordination of consumption-leisure decisions in determining the equilibrium working hours and wage rate when there are leisure externalities (e.g., due to social interactions). The latter are modelled by allowing a workers marginal utility of leisure to be increasing in the leisure time taken by other workers. Coordination takes the form of internalising the leisure externality and other relevant constraints (e.g., labour demand). The extent of openness is measured by the degree of capital mobility. We find that: coordination lowers equilibrium work hours and raises the wage rate; there is a U-shaped (inverse-U-shaped) relationship between work hours (wages) and the degree of coordination; coordination is welfare improving; and, the gap between the coordinated and uncoordinated work hours (and the corresponding wage rates) is affected by the extent and nature of openness.coordination; corporatism; openness; capital mobility; social multiplier; welfare; work hours	This was taken up by #AUTHOR_TAG (1957) in an article written almost 60 years ago in which he offered an explanation for the decline in the length of the working week since the end of the nineteenth century.

CC270	146503003	Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting, it also makes them more accessible	Nicolas Dumay	Memory Consolidation	"[""J T Wixted"", ""D J Cai""]"	Several forms of learning, including classical conditioning of the eyeblink, depend upon the cerebellum. In examining mechanisms of eyeblink conditioning in rabbits, reversible inactivations of the control circuitry have begun to dissociate aspects of cerebellar cortical and nuclear function in memory consolidation. It was previously shown that post-training cerebellar cortical, but not nuclear, inactivations with the GABA(A) agonist muscimol prevented consolidation but these findings left open the question as to how final memory storage was partitioned across cortical and nuclear levels. Memory consolidation might be essentially cortical and directly disturbed by actions of the muscimol, or it might be nuclear, and sensitive to the raised excitability of the nuclear neurons following the loss of cortical inhibition. To resolve this question, we simultaneously inactivated cerebellar cortical lobule HVI and the anterior interpositus nucleus of rabbits during the post-training period, so protecting the nuclei from disinhibitory effects of cortical inactivation. Consolidation was impaired by these simultaneous inactivations. Because direct application of muscimol to the nuclei alone has no impact upon consolidation, we can conclude that post-training, consolidation processes and memory storage for eyeblink conditioning have critical cerebellar cortical components. The findings are consistent with a recent model that suggests the distribution of learning-related plasticity across cortical and nuclear levels is task-dependent. There can be transfer to nuclear or brainstem levels for control of high-frequency responses but learning with lower frequency response components, such as in eyeblink conditioning, remains mainly dependent upon cortical memory storage	Nine decades down the forgetting curves, the beneficial impact of sleep on memory is well established (see #AUTHOR_TAG, 2014, for a review).

There are many reasons why homeowners buy the homes that they do; location, quality, price, amenities, and other factors play into those decisions. In the past, energy efficiency is believed only to have played a small role in particular home-purchase decisions. This report summarizes results of a ""natural experiment"" that describes views of homeowners who live in a 193-home residential tract outside of Sacramento, California. Homes in this tract are comparable in most respects except that they have substantially different levels of energy efficiency. In a series of four focus group discussions, views of these homeowners regarding their purchase decisions were collected and analyzed. Results suggest areas of further research, including mixed-method approaches to better understand the role of energy efficiency in homebuyer decisionmaking; investigating strategies for marketing energy efficiency; and investigating homeowner energy awareness that may be related to neighborhood design."

Although specific LTP expression mechanisms could be critical to determine the dynamics of repetitive neurotransmission, this important issue remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we have performed whole cell patch-clamp recordings of mossy fiber-granule cell LTP in acute rat cerebellar slices and studied its computational implications with a mathematical model. During LTP, stimulation with short impulse trains at 100 Hz revealed earlier initiation of granule cell spike bursts and a smaller nonsignificant spike frequency increase. In voltage-clamp recordings, short AMPA excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) trains showed short-term facilitation and depression and a sustained component probably generated by spillover. During LTP, facilitation disappeared, depression accelerated, and the sustained current increased. The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) current also increased. In agreement with a presynaptic expression caused by increased release probability, similar changes were observed by raising extracellular [Ca(2+)]. A mathematical model of mossy fiber-granule cell neurotransmission showed that increasing release probability efficiently modulated the first-spike delay. Glutamate spillover, by causing tonic NMDA and AMPA receptor activation, accelerated excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) temporal summation and maintained a sustained spike discharge. The effect of increasing neurotransmitter release could not be replicated by increasing receptor conductance, which, like postsynaptic manipulations enhancing intrinsic excitability, proved very effective in raising granule cell output frequency. Independent regulation of spike burst initiation and frequency during LTP may provide mechanisms for temporal recoding and gain control of afferent signals at the input stage of cerebellar cortex.

Robbins"", ""Kristy Lauver"", ""Huy Le"", ""Daniel Davis"", ""Ronelle Langley"", ""Aaron Carlstrom""]"	This study examines the relationship between psychosocial and study skill factors (PSFs) and college outcomes by meta-analyzing 109 studies. On the basis of educational persistence and motivational theory models, the PSFs were categorized into 9 broad constructs: achievement motivation, academic goals, institutional commitment, perceived social support, social involvement, academic self-efficacy, general self-concept, academic-related skills, and contextual influences. Two college outcomes were targeted: performance (cumulative grade point average; GPA) and persistence (retention). Meta-analyses indicate moderate relationships between retention and academic goals, academic self-efficacy, and academic-related skills (ps = .340, .359, and .366, respectively). The best predictors for GPA were academic self-efficacy and achievement motivation (ps = .496 and .303, respectively).

J. Powers"", ""D. A. Gusnard"", ""G. L. Shulman""]"	peer reviewedUsing modern brain imaging techniques, new discoveries are being made concerning the spontaneous activity of the brain when it is devoid of attention-demanding tasks. Spatially separated patches of neuronal assemblies have been found to show synchronized oscillatory activity behavior and are said to be functionally connected. One of the most robust of these is the default mode network, which is associated with intrinsic processes like mind wandering and self-projection. Furthermore, activity in this network is anticorrelated with activity in a network that is linked to attention to external stimuli. The integrity of both networks is disturbed in altered states of consciousness, like sleep, general anesthesia and hypnosis. In coma and related disorders of consciousness, encompassing the vegetative state (unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) and minimally conscious state, default mode network integrity correlates with the level of remaining consciousness, offering the possibility of using this information for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Functional brain imaging is currently being validated as a valuable addition to the standardized behavioral assessments that are already in use	"Mind-wandering is then typically reduced, and activity in the default-mode network is attenuated, a finding that originally arose out of experimental manipulations leading to the discovery of that network as one whose activity rises spontaneously and regularly in the absence of work on a task (a ""resting state""; #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001)."

The article first develops a theoretical framework by extending the basic communication model of diffusion to include state government's role in state government-sponsored innovation and its diffusion. This model also incorporates organizational and innovation factors. Next an empirical test of the extended communication model is conducted using data on innovations sponsored by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). The results suggest that the degree of state government involvement in innovation development is positively associated with diffusion. The results also indicate that state government's diffusion-facilitating efforts such as providing information about innovations, financial support during development, and procedural facilitation of development are positively related to industry's adoption decision for new innovation.	Moreover, Venkatraman et al. (1994) have stated that persuasion can occur both through vertical channels of communication (initiated by actors outside the set of potential adopters, such as central government; see also #AUTHOR_TAG and Bretschneider, 1997;Bobrowski and Bretschneider, 1994) as well as through processes of mimicking and 'word-of-mouth' diffusion (Wang and Doong, 2010) involving communication, interaction and persuasion among potential adopters (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983).

CC1386	82002670	Possible Hydrogen Transitions in the UK: Critical Uncertainties and Possible Decision Points	Will Mcdowall	Market penetration of fuel cell vehicles â€“ Analysis based on agent behaviour	"[""D KELES"", ""M WIETSCHEL"", ""D MOST"", ""O RENTZ""]"	This paper discusses the market penetration of fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) in Germany from the perspectives of different stakeholders. There are several economic studies and models describing the introduction of hydrogen-powered vehicles, but most of them focus on only one segment of the car market. Most studies analyse the impacts of FCVs on the automotive industry or the demand for FCVs separately, while others look at the required hydrogen infrastructure, but none of these analyses examines the car market as a whole. The analysis takes into account the actions of the whole market (consumers, automotive manufacturers, filling station owners and policymakers) and their interactions. According to the results of the System Dynamics model the combination of tax-free hydrogen fuel, subsidies on FCVs and sufficient hydrogen infrastructure supply will lead to quick market penetration of FCVs. The analysis clearly shows that the government is recommended to support the installation of a sufficient number of hydrogen filling pumps at the beginning of the market introduction (e.g. 500 filling stations). Due to the model results, approximately 4.8 billion Euros are needed to reach a successful market penetration of FCVs. Thereby about one-third of all passenger cars will be driven with hydrogen in 2040 and even two-third in 2050. Primarily subsidies and tax allowances for the vehicles are necessary to reduce the price of FCVs to the average level of modern diesel cars; otherwise consumers' acceptance of FCVs will be very low. A rapid introduction of FCVs based on these policies is necessary in order to limit the cumulative subsidies for the vehicles and the fuel-tax deficit	A review of these studies suggests some conclusions: x The scale of early infrastructure provision can be very important, with initial infrastructure availability proving very important in several studies [23,24,#AUTHOR_TAG].

CC71	42702124	Social network and content analysis of the North American Carbon Program as a scientific community of practice	Monica Ihli	Creating usable science: Opportunities and constraints for climate knowledge use and their implications for science policy	"[""L Dilling"", ""M C Lemos""]"	"Abstract In the past several decades, decision makers in the United States have increasingly called upon publicly funded science to provide ""usable"" information for policy making, whether in the case of acid rain, famine prevention or climate change policy. As demands for usability become more prevalent for publicly accountable scientific programs, there is a need to better understand opportunities and constraints to science use in order to inform policy design and implementation. Motivated by recent critique of the decision support function of the US Global Change Research Program, this paper seeks to address this issue by specifically examining the production and use of climate science. It reviews empirical evidence from the rich scholarship focused on climate science use, particularly seasonal climate forecasts, to identify factors that constrain or foster usability. It finds, first, that climate science usability is a function both of the context of potential use and of the process of scientific knowledge production itself. Second, nearly every case of successful use of climate knowledge involved some kind of iteration between knowledge producers and users. The paper argues that, rather than an automatic outcome of the call for the production of usable science, iterativity is the result of the action of specific actors and organizations who 'own' the task of building the conditions and mechanisms fostering its creation. Several different types of institutional arrangements can accomplish this task, depending on the needs and resources available. While not all of the factors that enhance usability of science for decision making are within the realm of the scientific enterprise itself, many do offer opportunities for improvement. Science policy mechanisms such as the level of flexibility afforded to research projects and the metrics used to evaluate the outcomes of research investment can be critical to providing the necessary foundation for iterativity and production of usable science to occur."

CC2614	16272271	Re-conceptualising the space of markets the case of the 2007-9 global financial crisis	Andrew Jones	The Origin of Financial Crisis: Central Banks, Credit Bubbles and the Efficient Market Fallacy	"[""G Cooper""]"	This book offers an explanation for the current credit crisis and for other speculative bubbles that preceded it. The author contends that central banks contribute to financial instability, addresses the problems that can arise when monetary policy is applied inconsistently, and explains the moral hazard problem inherent in central banksÕ acting as lenders of last resort. In The Origin of Financial Crises: Central Banks, Credit Bubbles and the Efficient Market Fallacy , George Cooper offers an explanation for the current credit crisis and for other speculative bubbles that preceded it. Building on the theories of Hyman Minsky and John Maynard Keynes, Cooper, a principal at Alignment Investors, argues that such bubbles are the result of an inherent instability of the financial system. When financial assets are financed by debt and marked to market, a drop in asset prices sets off a downward spiral. Lenders force the sale of assets that serve as collateral on loans that become undercollateralized owing to the initial drop in asset prices. Conversely, an increase in asset prices facilitates an increase in financial leverage because the higher collateral value can support a larger amount of debt. To offset these destabilizing factors, Cooper recommends intervention by a government agencyÑnamely, a central bank. According to Cooper, existing central banks are ineffective because they focus on price stability of consumer goods whereas they should be focusing on stability of asset prices. Cooper believes that focusing on consumer price inflation is unnecessary because goods markets are inherently stable (that is, higher prices cause a drop in demand and vice versa). The reason central banks do not target asset prices is that they erroneously believe the fallacy of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), according to whichÑby CooperÕs definitionÑassets are always correctly priced. He maintains that to achieve stability in asset prices, central banks should steer changes in the aggregate amount of credit creation. And every once in a while, for good measure, they should engage in a sudden withdrawal of liquidity as a sort of systemic fire drill that keeps market participants on their toes. CooperÕs contention that central banks contribute to financial instability is not new, at least not to central banks. In a speech in September 2005, well before the current credit crisis began, Alan Greenspan, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board chairman at the time, acknowledged that if a central bank is successful in reducing fluctuations in the business cycle, it decreases systemic risk; but in so doing, it may inadvertently trigger risk complacency on the part of market participants. In a November 2008 speech, the FedÕs vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, made the same argument. Still, Cooper does make some worthwhile points. His charge that monetary policy is inconsistent if it means laissez faire during an economic expansion and interventionism during a contraction has some validity. Cooper is also correct that KeynesÕ prescriptions were intended to move an economy out of a depression but are nowadays used more to avoid recessions than to exit depressions. Cooper also argues correctly that the achievement of so-called soft landings prevents borrowers from learning firsthand that their excessive borrowing is indeed excessive. And CooperÕs belief that Òit is better to have a volatile and growing economy than a stable and stagnant oneÓ is likely to find acceptance by many readers. Finally, Cooper does a commendable job in explaining the moral hazard problem inherent in central banksÕ acting as lenders of last resort. Nevertheless, CooperÕs criticism of the efficient market hypothesis and of its application to central banking misses the mark. In his view, the basic tenet of the EMH is that asset prices are always ÒcorrectÓ and that equilibrium is, therefore, the result. He is correct in contending that neoclassical economics probably focuses too much on equilibrium conditions and not enough on the process by which we move from one state to the nextÑin effect, never quite reaching equilibrium. But the EMH does not really imply equilibrium. It merely states that available information is reflected in asset prices. As new information arrives, prices change. Because new information arrives irregularly, prices change irregularly. Thus, there is no equilibrium. Likewise, the EMH makes no claims as to whether a price is ÒcorrectÓ (whatever a correct price might be). Similarly, aiming for stability in prices of goodsÑas most central banks do most of the timeÑis not quite the same thing as expressing a judgment about the ÒcorrectnessÓ of the existing price level (again, whatever that might be). The reason that central banks pursue price stability is that a fiat currency requires an inflation anchor. Cooper ignores such watershed episodes as the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic in the 1920s, the Great Inflation in the United States in the 1970s, andÑto cite a contemporary exampleÑthe inflation and socioeconomic unrest in Zimbabwe today. (In general, the book is featherlight when it comes to empirical evidence.) Central bankers express two main reasons for not targeting asset prices: (1) It is virtually impossible to distinguish a bubble from a more justified increase in asset prices, and (2) a change in the monetary policy that would be required to deflate an incipient bubble might well trigger an economic recession. Cooper dispenses with these ideas in a single footnote. As an argument for the drastic change in monetary policy that he proposes or as an explanation for the current credit crisis, his thesis is woefully inadequate.

We show that, beyond its rhetorical function, answering this question involves important discussions about genetic research, testing, regulation, and social provision for people who are sick or disabled. It raises difficult questions about clients' and service providers' autonomy and responsibility and about which human illnesses, conditions, and characteristics ought to be the subject of research and testing. In particular, we show how differences in the amount and type of information and advice available to clients of genetic testing, the level of social support to people with particular conditions, and people's perception of stigma, suffering, and quality of life, make drawing the line highly problematic. We end by discussing the implications of our analysis for policy making, considering how the ambiguities and tensions in lay accounts might enable, as opposed to stifle, greater democratization of the new genetics."

The proposed definition suggests that communicative competence is a relative and dynamic, interpersonal construct based on functionality of communication, adequacy of communication, and sufficiency of knowledge, judgement, and skill in four interrelated areas: linguistic competence, operational competence, social competence, and strategic competence. Linguistic and operational competencies refer to knowledge and skills in the use of the tools of communication; social and strategic competencies reflect functional knowledge and judgement in interaction. The paper urges future research to validate the proposed definition of communicative competence and suggests some implications for assessment and intervention in the AAC field.

Tachizawa""]"	"Purpose _ To make their supply chains more socially responsible, many companies are implementing supplier assessment tools and collaborative practices. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic literature review on the governance structures used to extend sustainability to suppliers. More specifically, the authors aim to answer two questions: ""What is the impact of these mechanisms or governance structures on sustainable performance?"" and ""What are the enablers of these mechanisms?"". Design/methodology/approach _ A structured literature review is carried out that analyses published studies, evaluates contributions, summarises knowledge and identifies managerial implications and lines for further research. Findings _ Both assessment and collaboration have a positive impact on environmental performance and corporate social responsibility, although the most recent collaborative paradigm stresses that assessment alone is not enough. Some enablers of these practices are identified. Research limitations/implications _ Although the authors believe that the right search terms have been used, the choice of these terms could be a limitation of this study. Also, the selection of the articles could be considered subjective, although the papers were reviewed by two researchers. Practical implications _ Supplier assessment and collaboration are effective in improving sustainability. However, the results also indicate that assessment alone is not enough. Firms also need to adopt a collaborative approach. Finally, a list of enablers to implement these practices is provided. Originality/value _ The paper summarises knowledge related to the impact of supplier assessment and collaboration on sustainability, and describes the enablers of such initiatives, providing some managerial implications and lines for further research."

We found that reliably and continually changing cell assemblies in the rat hippocampus appeared not only during spatial navigation but also in the absence of changing environmental or body-derived inputs. During the delay period of a memory task, each moment in time was characterized by the activity of a particular assembly of neurons. Identical initial conditions triggered a similar assembly sequence, whereas different conditions gave rise to different sequences, thereby predicting behavioral choices, including errors. Such sequences were not formed in control (nonmemory) tasks. We hypothesize that neuronal representations, evolved for encoding distance in spatial navigation, also support episodic recall and the planning of action sequences.

CC1320	93144659	A Review of Psychometric Data Analysis and Applications	Geraldine Gray	Intelligence, academic abilities, and personality	"[""J\u00fcri Allik"", ""Anu Realo""]"	It has been proposed that personality (in the narrow sense) and intelligence are uncorrelated and essentially independent constructs (Eysenck, H. J., 1994, Personality and intelligence: psychometric and experimental approaches. In R. J. Sternberg and P. Ruzgis (Eds.), Personality and intelligence (pp. 3Ð31), New York: Cambridge University Press). The results of this study show that personality dimensions measured by the NEO Personality Inventory stay clearly apart from academic abilities and psychometrically measured intelligence. Correlation and joint factor analyses demonstrated that most of the valid variance in academic achievement and intelligence was not related to personality measures in the Estonian population forming a separate dimension of individual differences. The lack of correlation between academic abilities and personality, however, does not exclude that individuals with low or high intellectual abilities might use their intellectual resources differently for the expression of their individuality. It was found that low-intelligence persons use their intellectual abilities primarily for seeking excitement and elaborating fantasies; high-intelligence persons, in contrast, use their intellect for regulating and controlling their affective lives.

CC1184	82852800	Goal Commitments and the content of thoughts and dreams: basic principles	Eric Klinger	What Mind Wandering Reveals About Executive-Control Abilities and Failures	"[""Jennifer C. McVay"", ""Michael J. Kane""]"	PeopleÕs minds sometimes wander from ongoing activities. Although these experiences can be pleasant and useful, they are often unintentional and precipitate mistakes. In this article, we adopt an individual-differences perspective in considering unwanted mind wandering as an indicator of both momentary failures of and enduring deficiencies in executive-control functions. We describe research that associates normal variation in working memory capacity (WMC)Ña cognitive ability that broadly predicts intellectual capabilities and accomplishmentsÑwith off-task thinking. In laboratory and daily-life assessments, people with lower WMC mind wander more frequently than do those with higher WMC, at least during demanding tasks. Moreover, the error-proneness of lower-WMC subjects seems to arise partly from their vulnerability to mind wandering. Executive control over oneÕs thoughts therefore seems to contribute to the effective regulation of behavior.	McVay and Kane's conceptualization (e.g.,#AUTHOR_TAG and McVay, 2012;McVay and Kane, 2012b), on the other hand, features proactive executive control that keeps people focused on their goal pursuits, from which mind-wandering distracts.

Mrazek"", ""Jonathan Smallwood"", ""Michael S. Franklin"", ""Jason M. Chin"", ""Benjamin Baird"", ""Jonathan W. Schooler""]"	Tests of working memory capacity (WMC) and fluid intelligence (gF) are thought to capture variability in a crucial cognitive capacity that is broadly predictive of success, yet pinpointing the exact nature of this capacity is an area of ongoing controversy. We propose that mind-wandering is associated with performance on tests of WMC and gF, thereby partially explaining both the reliable correlations between these tests and their broad predictive utility. Existing evidence indicates that both WMC and gF are correlated with performance on tasks of attention, yet more decisive evidence requires an assessment of the role of attention and, in particular, mind-wandering during performance of these tests. Four studies employing complementary methodological designs embedded thought sampling into tests of general aptitude and determined that mind-wandering was consistently associated with worse performance on these measures. Collectively, these studies implicate the capacity to avoid mind-wandering during demanding tasks as a potentially important source of success on measures of general aptitude, while also raising important questions about whether the previously documented relationship between WMC and mind-wandering can be exclusively attributed to executive failures preceding mind-wandering (McVay & Kane, 2010b).(PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Is adhering to this view considered to be one of the components of the notion of being a good scientist? This paper explores responses of geneticists interviewed in the UK, the USA and Russia about the cultural meanings of their work. When discussing this question the interviewees distinguished between their 'personal' and 'professional' views. When talking as 'lay people' they demonstrated a wide range of opinions none of which was perceived as incompatible with scientific practice. When talking as 'scientists' the respondents stressed that the cultural implications of their research were not a matter of their professional concern. It is suggested that these two trends in their answers could be explained by scientists tending to relegate the implications of their work to the realm of the social which they construe as divorced from scientific practice.

It is focused on the existence of a quasi-fluctuation-dissipation theorem (QFDT) in glassy systems and the current supporting knowledge gained from numerical simulation studies. It covers a broad range of non-stationary aging and stationary driven systems such as structural glasses, spin glasses, coarsening systems, ferromagnetic models at criticality, trap models, models with entropy barriers, kinetically constrained models, sheared systems and granular media. The review is divided into four main parts: (1) an introductory section explaining basic notions related to the existence of the FDT in equilibrium and its possible extension to the glassy regime (QFDT), (2) a description of the basic analytical tools and results derived in the framework of some exactly solvable models, (3) a detailed report of the current evidence in favour of the QFDT and (4) a brief digression on the experimental evidence in its favour. This review is intended for inexpert readers who want to learn about the basic notions and concepts related to the existence of the QFDT as well as for the more expert readers who may be interested in more specific results.	Suitably modified versions of the FDT also hold for out-of-equilibrium systems (Cugliandolo et al., 1997;#AUTHOR_TAG and Ritort, 2003;Pottier and Mauger, 2004;Allegrini et al., 2007;Aquino et al., 2007).

In constructing a conceptual framework to guide that science, Simon drew heavily on insights from cognitive psychology. Since its publication in 1947, Administrative Behaviorhas inspired researchers investigating institutional and organizational practices across many settings. Here, consideration is given to the impact of Administrative Behavior in public policy and public administration. Four legacies are highlighted. They are: scholarship on incrementalism in policy-making, scholarship on agenda setting, scholarship on choice architecture, and scholarship on expertise and learning organizations. Continuous improvements in information technology and its application, combined with increasing citizen demands for more effective and efficient government, suggest ideas introduced in Administrative Behavior will continue to influence theory and practice in policy design and public management for years to come.

Russell"", ""Frank J. Cerny"", ""Elaine T. Stathopoulos""]"	This study was completed to determine how ventilatory responses change by means of speech reading at three different sound pressure levels (SPL) as compared to quiet breathing prior to each task. The energy required to alter SPL was also studied and compared to energy expenditures during a quiet breathing condition. Twenty-four adults (12 women, 12 men) were studied while reading a standard passage at low, comfortable, and high SPLs for 7 minutes with quiet breathing periods between each task to achieve respiratory steady state and serve as a control to which the reading tasks were compared. The last 2 minutes of exhaled air for all speaking and quiet breathing tasks were collected using a Hans Rudolph mouth breathing face mask. A Sensor Medics Vmax 29 series diagnostic instrument system measured all ventilatory responses and energy expenditures. Volume and timing alterations in ventilation were characterized by measuring tidal volume (V[T]), inspiratory time (T[I]), inspiratory flow rate (V[T]/T[I]), and expiratory time (T[E]). Average ventilation, energy expenditure, and adequacy of ventilation were measured using minute ventilation (V[E]), oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), and partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (end-tidal PET[CO2]). Results indicated volume, timing, ventilation, and energy expenditure values remained closest to quiet breathing values for the comfortable SPL. Volume, ventilation, and energy expenditure were significantly greater for the high SPL and lower for the low SPL, compared to the baseline steady state, indicating that the low SPL causes a ventilatory deficit that was found to be paid back at the end of the speech task during the quiet breathing period. These results demonstrate that an individual's comfortable SPL is the least energy-requiring way to speech breathe. As SPL rises above or below comfortable SPL, speech breathing requires more energy.	Manual language is effortful, requiring considerable expenditure of energy, while the physiological costs of speech are so low as to be nearly unmeasurable (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1998).

Falkovich"", ""K. Gaw\u0229dzki"", ""M. Vergassola""]"	The understanding of fluid turbulence has considerably progressed in recent years. The application of the methods of statistical mechanics to the description of the motion of fluid particles, i.e. to the Lagrangian dynamics, has led to a new quantitative theory of intermittency in turbulent transport. The first analytical description of anomalous scaling laws in turbulence has been obtained. The underlying physical mechanism reveals the role of statistical integrals of motion in non-equilibrium systems. For turbulent transport, the statistical conservation laws are hidden in the evolution of groups of fluid particles and arise from the competition between the expansion of a group and the change of its geometry. By breaking the scale-invariance symmetry, the statistically conserved quantities lead to the observed anomalous scaling of transported fields. Lagrangian methods also shed new light on some practical issues, such as mixing and turbulent magnetic dynamo.Comment: 165 pages, review article for Rev. Mod.

Smith"", ""D. Ventura"", ""J. T. Prince""]"	Contact: 2robsmith@gmail.com, jtprince@chem.byu.edu Bioinformatic research has produced a large volume of proposed algorithmic solutions to a host of problems. Whether presented as a processing step in a clinical experiment or treated in a stand-alone publication, novel bioinformatic algorithms are often not subjected to the thorough comparative evaluation endured by their counterparts in other closely related fields--such as computer science--where an algorithm unevaluated against extant methods is considered unpublishable. Two audiences are interested in algorithmic publications: the practitioner, who may use the algorithm, and the researcher, who will work to develop solutions superior to those extant. We argue that failure during the review/publication process to require comparative evaluation for novel algorithms is detrimental to both parties. To demonstrate the dilemma, we conducted a case study of novel LC-MS alignment algorithms. Of the 48 publications from 2001 to 2012 that present alignment algorithms of which we are aware, 60% include no comparison to other methods.

In this report we aimed to show that Arabidopsis thaliana syntaxins are involved in this process and contribute to spatially define exocytosis and membrane recycling.Using GFP-fusion constructs, we imaged the distribution of pollen-specific (AtSYP124) and non-pollen syntaxins (AtSYP121 and AtSYP122) in transiently transformed Nicotiana tabacum pollen tubes. All three proteins associate with the plasma membrane and with apical vesicles indicating a conserved action mechanism for all SYPs. However, the GFP tagged SYP124 showed a specific distribution with a higher labelling at the plasma membrane flanks, 10-25 mum behind the apex. This distribution is affected by Ca2+ fluxes as revealed by treatment with Gd3+ (an inhibitor of extracellular Ca2+ influx) and TMB-8 (an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+ release). Both inhibitors decreased growth rate but the distribution of SYP124 at the plasma membrane was more strongly affected by Gd3+. Competition with a related dominant negative mutant affected the specific distribution of SYP124 but not tip growth. In contrast, co-expression of the phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate 5-kinase 4 (PIP5K4) or of the small GTPase Rab11 perturbed polarity and the normal distribution of GFP-SYP but did not inhibit the accumulation in vesicles or at the plasma membrane.The results presented suggest that in normal growing pollen tubes, a net exocytic flow occurs in the flanks of the tube apex mediated by SYP124. The specific distribution of SYP124 at the plasma membrane is affected by changes in Ca2+ levels in agreement with the importance of this ion for exocytosis. Apical growth and the specific localization of SYP124 were affected by regulators of membrane secretion (Ca2+, PIP5K4 and Rab11) but competition with a dominant negative mutant affected only SYP distribution. These data thus suggest that syntaxins alone do not provide the level of specificity that is required for apical growth and that additional signalling and functional mechanisms are required.

Organizational Change and Isomorphic Pressures in the Public Sector	"[""R. Ashworth"", ""G. Boyne"", ""R. Delbridge""]"	Institutional theory suggests that organizations pursue legitimacy by conforming to isomorphic pressures in their environment. We extend previous research on institutional theory by distinguishing between two definitions of conformity (compliance and convergence) and by taking a comprehensive view of the organizational characteristics that might be subject to isomorphic pressures. This framework is applied to change between 2001 and 2004 in the internal characteristics of 101 public organizations in England. We find substantial evidence of compliance but more limited support for convergence. Furthermore, the impact of isomorphic pressures was stronger on organizational strategies and culture than on structures and processes. Thus, the relevance of institutional theory to change in the public sector depends on the definition of conformity that is used and the organizational characteristics that are examined.

Atoms in the square lattice can be placed in a double well with any of their four nearest neighbors. The properties of the double well (the barrier height and relative energy offset of the paired sites) can be dynamically controlled. The topology of the lattice is phase stable against phase noise imparted by vibrational noise on mirrors. We demonstrate the dynamic control of the lattice by showing the coherent splitting of atoms from single wells into double wells and observing the resulting double-slit atom diffraction pattern. This lattice can be used to test controlled neutral atom motion among lattice sites and should allow for testing controlled two-qubit gates.Comment: 9 pages, 11 figures Accepted for publication in Physical Review	In this paper, we extend the JZ proposal and discuss a new scheme based on an optical superlattice [#AUTHOR_TAG,26] to generate a gauge potential leading to (1).

Kim"", ""Sebastian Joyce"", ""John V. Williams""]"	Viruses are leading causes of severe acute lower respiratory infections (LRIs). These infections evoke incomplete immunity, as individuals can be repeatedly reinfected throughout life. We report that acute viral LRI causes rapid pulmonary CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (TCD8) functional impairment via programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) signaling, a pathway previously associated with prolonged antigenic stimulation during chronic infections and cancer. PD-1-mediated TCD8 impairment occurred acutely in mice following infection with human metapneumovirus or influenza virus. Viral antigen was sufficient for PD-1 upregulation, but induction of PD-L1 was required for impairment. During secondary viral infection or epitope-only challenge, memory TCD8 rapidly reexpressed PD-1 and exhibited severe functional impairment. Inhibition of PD-1 signaling using monoclonal antibody blockade prevented TCD8 impairment, reduced viral titers during primary infection, and enhanced protection of immunized mice against challenge infection. Additionally, PD-1 and PD-L1 were upregulated in the lungs of patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, or parainfluenza virus infection. These results indicate that PD-1 mediates TCD8 functional impairment during acute viral infection and may contribute to recurrent viral LRIs. Therefore, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may represent a therapeutic target in the treatment of respiratory viruses.

We conducted influenza infection studies in healthy volunteers with no detectable antibodies to the challenge viruses H3N2 or H1N1. We mapped T cell responses to influenza before and during infection. We found a large increase in influenza-specific T cell responses by day 7, when virus was completely cleared from nasal samples and serum antibodies were still undetectable. Preexisting CD4+, but not CD8+, T cells responding to influenza internal proteins were associated with lower virus shedding and less severe illness. These CD4+ cells also responded to pandemic H1N1 (A/CA/07/2009) peptides and showed evidence of cytotoxic activity. These cells are an important statistical correlate of homotypic and heterotypic response and may limit severity of influenza infection by new strains in the absence of specific antibody responses.

Bussey"", ""Anthony Dickinson""]"	According to the 'mental time travel hypothesis' animals, unlike humans, cannot mentally travel backwards in time to recollect specific past events (episodic memory) or forwards to anticipate future needs (future planning). Until recently, there was little evidence in animals for either ability. Experiments on memory in food-caching birds, however, question this assumption by showing that western scrub-jays form integrated, flexible, trial-unique memories of what they hid, where and when. Moreover, these birds can adjust their caching behaviour in anticipation of future needs. We suggest that some animals have elements of both episodic-like memory and future planning.	For instance, scrub jays can recover cached food on the basis not only of where it was cached, but also of when it was cached, which might be taken to imply episodic memory of the caching episode itself (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2003).

CC2986	82867364	Wandering tales: evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language	Michael Corballis	The Origin of Stories evolution Cognition and Fiction	"[""B Boyd""]"	A century and a half after the publication of Origin of Species, evolutionary thinking has expanded beyond the field of biology to include virtually all human-related subjectsÑanthropology, archeology, psychology, economics, religion, morality, politics, culture, and art. Now a distinguished scholar offers the first comprehensive account of the evolutionary origins of art and storytelling. Brian Boyd explains why we tell stories, how our minds are shaped to understand them, and what difference an evolutionary understanding of human nature makes to stories we love. Art is a specifically human adaptation, Boyd argues. It offers tangible advantages for human survival, and it derives from play, itself an adaptation widespread among more intelligent animals. More particularly, our fondness for storytelling has sharpened social cognition, encouraged cooperation, and fostered creativity. After considering art as adaptation, Boyd examines HomerÕs Odyssey and Dr. SeussÕs Horton Hears a Who! demonstrating how an evolutionary lens can offer new understanding and appreciation of specific works. What triggers our emotional engagement with these works? What patterns facilitate our responses? The need to hold an audienceÕs attention, Boyd underscores, is the fundamental problem facing all storytellers.

CC197	41241868	The Views and Experiences of Smokers Who Quit Smoking Unassisted. A Systematic Review of the Qualitative Evidence	Andrea Smith	Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social-Cognitive View	"[""A Bandura""]"	A comprehensive theory of human motivation and action from a social cognitive perspective is presented in this book. It deals with the prominent roles played by cognitive, vicarious, self-reflective, and self-regulatory processes in psychosocial functioning. The book is organized to emphasize the reciprocal causation through the interplay of cognitive, behavioral, and environmental factors. Albert Bandura systematically applies this social cognitive theory to personal and social change. Among its highlights, the book: covers a wide range of issues relating to human thought, motivation, and behavior; provides a theory of social diffusion and innovation that integrates modeling and social-network influences; shows how converging technological changes are transforming the nature and scope of human influence; [and] analyzes the determinants and processes governing personal and social change.

For one such measure, The EuroQol, designed to be used for these purposes, it was necessary to derive a single index value for each of the 243 health states it generates. The problem was that it was virtually impossible to generate direct valuations for all of these states, and thus it was necessary to find a procedure that allows the valuations of all EuroQol states to be interpolated from direct valuations on a subset of these. Methods:ÊIn a recent study, direct valuations were elicited for 42 EuroQol health states (using the time trade-off method) from a representative sample of the UK population. This article reports on the methodology that was adopted to build up a ""tariff"" of EuroQol values from this data. Results:ÊA parsimonious model that fits the data well was defined as one in which valuations were explained in terms of the level of severity associated with each dimension, an intercept associated with any move away from full health, and a term that picked up whether any dimension in the state was at its most severe level. Conclusions:ÊThe model presented in this article appears to predict the values of the states for which there are direct observations and, thus, can be used to interpolate values for the states for which no direct observations exist."

Zurek""]"	Measurements --- interactions which establish correlations between a system and a recording device --- can be made thermodynamically reversible. One might be concerned that such reversibility will make the second law of thermodynamics vulnerable to the designs of the demon of choice, a selective version of Maxwell's demon. The strategy of the demon of choice is to take advantage of rare fluctuations to extract useful work, and to reversibly undo measurements which do not lead to such a favorable but unlikely outcomes. I show that this threat does not arise as the demon of choice cannot operate without recording (explicitely or implicitely) whether its measurement was a success (or a failure). Thermodynamic cost associated with such a record cannot be, on the average, made smaller than the gain of useful work derived from the fluctuations.Comment: 20 pages including figures in Te	"In contrast to the traditional definitions of entropy, algorithmic randomness can be used to measure disorder without any recourse to probabilities"" (#AUTHOR_TAG 1989)."

Organizational knowledge will grow and develop if the organization has the ability to learn continuously, regardless of whether it is an Academic, Business or Government (ABG) organization. Our research in this area was triggered by the concept of a 'learning state' in the knowledge era which has been defined as "" a state skilled at creating, acquiring, and sharing knowledge between Academia, Business and Government (ABG)"". To prove this concept, empirical research in 9 Indonesian companies was conducted and enriched with empirical findings from a case study of knowledge sharing activities within faculties of SBM ITB, a business school in a leading Indonesian university. The studies confirmed much of the current KM literature and helped to develop new insights. They were also instrumental in identifying certain contradictions and paradoxes. The conceptual framework which resulted from our research can be used as reference point to answer the following question: ""Can ITB play an important role as a knowledge transformation hub in bridging ABG sectors to create value through knowledge sharing among participating actors""? Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) is Indonesia's oldest and most renowned technology school. It was here where the idea of creating the so-called 'Bandung High-Tech Valley' was launched decades ago.

Historically, seden-tary behaviour was conceptualized as one end of the physical activity spectrum but is increasingly being viewed as a behaviour distinct from physical activity. Methods Prospective studies examining the associations between screen time (watching television, watching videos and using a computer) and sitting time and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) were identified. These prospective studies relied on self-reported sedentary behaviour. Results The majority of prospective studies of screen time and sitting time has shown that greater sedentary time is associated with an increased risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD. Compared with the lowest levels of sedentary time, risk estimates ranged up to 1.68 for the highest level of sitting time and 2.25 for the highest level of screen time after adjustment for a series of covariates, including measures of physical activity. For six studies of screen time and CVD, the summary hazard ratio per 2-h increase was 1.17 (95% CI: 1.13-1.20). For two studies of sitting time, the summary hazard ratio per 2-h increase was 1.05 (95 % CI: 1.01-1.09). Conclusions Future prospective studies using more objective measures of seden-tary behaviour might prove helpful in quantifying better the risk between sedentary behaviour and CVD morbidity and mortality.

Goulder"", ""Paul Klenerman"", ""Rafi Ahmed"", ""Gordon J. Freeman"", ""Bruce D. Walker""]"	Functional impairment of T cells is characteristic of many chronic mouse and human viral infections. The inhibitory receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1; also known as PDCD1), a negative regulator of activated T cells, is markedly upregulated on the surface of exhausted virus-specific CD8 T cells in mice. Blockade of this pathway using antibodies against the PD ligand 1 (PD-L1, also known as CD274) restores CD8 T-cell function and reduces viral load. To investigate the role of PD-1 in a chronic human viral infection, we examined PD-1 expression on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific CD8 T cells in 71 clade-C-infected people who were naive to anti-HIV treatments, using ten major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I tetramers specific for frequently targeted epitopes. Here we report that PD-1 is significantly upregulated on these cells, and expression correlates with impaired HIV-specific CD8 T-cell function as well as predictors of disease progression: positively with plasma viral load and inversely with CD4 T-cell count. PD-1 expression on CD4 T cells likewise showed a positive correlation with viral load and an inverse correlation with CD4 T-cell count, and blockade of the pathway augmented HIV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell function. These data indicate that the immunoregulatory PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is operative during a persistent viral infection in humans, and define a reversible defect in HIV-specific T-cell function. Moreover, this pathway of reversible T-cell impairment provides a potential target for enhancing the function of exhausted T cells in chronic HIV infection.

This argument is based on the close temporal, semantic, pragmatic, pathological, and developmental parallels between speech and referential and discourse-oriented gestures. The symbolic character of gestures is demonstrated with examples of gestures produced by 5 women who were narrating the same event from a cartoon story. Evidence is also presented in support of the conclusions that (1) gestures occur only during speech, (2) they have semantic and pragmatic functions that parallel those of speech, (3) they are synchronized with linguistic units, (4) they dissolve (as does speech) in aphasia, and (5) they develop together with speech in children.

CC2271	81800077	Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	Fabio Reale	THREE-DIMENSIONAL MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC MODELING OF PROPAGATING DISTURBANCES IN FAN-LIKE CORONAL LOOPS	"[""Tongjiang Wang"", ""Leon Ofman"", ""Joseph M. Davila""]"	Quasi-periodic propagating intensity disturbances (PDs) have been observed in large coronal loops in EUV images over a decade, and are widely accepted to be slow magnetosonic waves. However, spectroscopic observations from Hinode/EIS revealed their association with persistent coronal upflows, making this interpretation debatable. Motivated by the scenario that the coronal upflows could be cumulative result of numerous individual flow pulses generated by sporadic heating events (nanoflares) at the loop base, we construct a velocity driver with repetitive tiny pulses, whose energy frequency distribution follows the flare power-law scaling. We then perform 3D MHD modeling of an idealized bipolar active region by applying this broadband velocity driver at the footpoints of large coronal loops which appear open in the computational domain. Our model successfully reproduces the PDs with similar features as the observed, and shows that any upflow pulses inevitably excite slow magnetosonic wave disturbances propagating along the loop. We find that the generated PDs are dominated by the wave signature as their propagation speeds are consistent with the wave speed in the presence of flows, and the injected flows rapidly decelerate with height. Our simulation results suggest that the observed PDs and associated persistent upflows may be produced by small-scale impulsive heating events (nanoflares) at the loop base, and that the flows and waves may both contribute to the PDs at lower heights.

CC2691	6560220	Political Reforms and Public Policies: Evidence from Agricultural Protection	Alessandro Olper	Income and Democracy	"[""Daron Acemoglu"", ""Simon Johnson"", ""James A Robinson"", ""Pierre Yared""]"	We revisit one of the central empirical findings of the political economy literature that higher income per capita causes democracy. Existing studies establish a strong cross-country correlation between income and democracy, but do not typically control for factors that simultaneously affect both variables. We show that controlling for such factors by including country fixed effects removes the statistical association between income per capita and various measures of democracy. We also present instrumental-variables using two different strategies. These estimates also show no causal effect of income on democracy. Furthermore, we reconcile the positive cross-country correlation between income and democracy with the absence of a causal effect of income on democracy by showing that the long-run evolution of income and democracy is related to historical factors. Consistent with this, the positive correlation between income and democracy disappears, even without fixed effects, when we control for the historical determinants of economic and political development in a sample of former European colonies.	Furthermore, the direction of causation is hard to establish (see #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008;Gundlach and Paldam, 2009).

Henneberg"", ""Peter Naud\u00e9"", ""Stefanos Mouzas""]"	Business networks are complex webs of interdependent exchange relationships within which companies and individual managers operate. They consist of manifold actors, complex interactions, as well as organizational structures and resource transformation processes. Business managers cannot just capitulate vis-a-vis this complexity. Making sense of complex business networks helps managers to understand their own position, as well as their available options for change. Similarly, research in the area of sense-making and management in business networks may help us understand how managers cope with the contextual complexity in business networks, and how managers construct the forms in which this complexity appears. This paper identifies six major research themes that need to be taken up in the future with regard to sense-making and management in business networks, and discusses some methodological issues to advance our knowledge in this area.

Thomas Vanoutrive	Guaranteed Ride Home Programs: A Study of Program Characteristics, Utilization, and Cost	"[""William Menczer""]"	Guaranteed ride home programs play an important role in increasing public transportation ridership by providing a good reason to separate commuters from their single occupancy vehicles. Since they are inexpensive insurance policies, these programs provide a cost-effective way for a commuter to leave work in the event of a personal or family emergency or unexpected overtime. Research results show that usage rates and costs are quite low. As a possible incentive for commuters to leave their cars at home, these findings may make these programs attractive to communities that want to reduce congestion by increasing public transportation use. The research includes an examination of 55 such programs that serve the top 150 transit agencies in the United States.

CC2224	81800077	Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	Fabio Reale	Hinode observations of transverse waves with flows in coronal loops	"[""L. Ofman"", ""T. J. Wang""]"	Aims. We report the first evidence for transverse waves in coronal multithreaded loops with cool plasma ejected from the chromosphere flowing along the threads. These observations are good candidates for coronal seismology. Methods. We analyzed observations made with Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board the Hinode satellite in the Ca II H line filter. Results. The oscillations are visible for about 3 periods, with a period lasting about 2 min, with weak damping. We see the oscillations in thin threads (~0.5  ) of cool plasma flowing in the coronal loops with speeds in the range 74-123 km s -1 . Conclusions. Observations indicate that the waves exhibit different properties in the various threads. In some threads, the waves are nearly standing fundamental kink modes with a phase speed of about 1250 km s -1 , whereas the dynamics of other threads is consistent with propagating fast magnetosonic waves. Based on the observed wave and loop properties and the assumed active region loop density in the range (1-5) x 10 9 cm -3 , the estimated energy flux is sufficient to heat the loops to coronal temperatures, and the average magnetic field in the threads is estimated as 20 +- 7G .

Observations are compared to numerical simulations of the response of the solar atmosphere to an energy perturbation of4 x 1024 ergs representing an energy release during magnetic reconnection in a 1-D semi-circular flux tube. The temporal evolution of the thermodynamic state of the loop is converted into Civ 1548, Ovi 1032 and Neviii 770 line profiles in non-equilibrium ionization. Performing an integration over the entire period of simulations, a redshift of ~ 6 km s-1 is found in Civ, while a blue-shift of~ 2kms-1 and~ 10kms-1 were derived for Ovi and Neviii, respectively, in reasonable agreement with observations.	Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain these redshifts: downward propagating acoustic waves (Hansteen, 1993), downdrafts driven by radiativelycooling condensations in the solar transition region (Reale et al., 1996(Reale et al., , 1997b, nanoflares (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1999); the scenario is improving with the better and better definition of the observational framework.

This, in turn, means that there are no absolute measures of usability, since, if the usability of an artefact is defined by the context in which that artefact is used, measures of usability must of necessity be defined by that context too. Despite this, there is a need for broad general measures which can be used to compare usability across a range of contexts. In addition, there is a need for ""quick and dirty "" methods to allow low cost assessments of usability in industrial systems evaluation. This chapter describes the System Usability Scale (SUS) a reliable, low-cost usability scale that can be used for global assessments of systems usability. Usability and context Usability is not a quality that exists in any real or absolute sense. Perhaps it can be best summed up as being a general quality of the appropriateness to a purpose of any particular artefact. This notion is neatly summed up by Terry Pratchett in his novel ""Moving Pictures"": ""  'Well, at least he keeps himself fit, ' said the Archchancellor nastily. 'Not like the rest of you fellows.

The Dean looks like a man who's swallered a bed!' 'Ah, but Master, ' said the Bursar, smiling indulgently, 'the word ""fit"",as I understand it, means ""appropriate to a purpose"", and I would say that the body of the Dean is supremely appropriate to the purpose of sitting around all day and eating big heavy meals. ' The Dean permitted himself a little smile. "" (Pratchett, 1990) In just the same way, the usability of any tool or system has to be viewed in terms of the context in which it is used, and its appropriateness to that context.

The aims of this study were to examine the prevalence and demographic correlates of PLE in young adults.The sample consisted of 2441 subjects aged 18-23 years. Subjects completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the 21-item Peters Delusional Inventory (PDI). Associations between age, gender, hallucinations and delusions were examined using logistic regression.Both CIDI hallucinations and delusions predicted high scores on the PDI. Younger age was significantly associated with endorsement of CIDI delusions [odds ratio (OR) = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-0.92) and with PDI total scores (OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.55-0.83). Women were significantly more likely to endorse items related to hallucinations (OR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.14-1.95) but not delusions.PLE are common in young adults. The mechanisms underpinning the age and gender gradients in PLE may provide clues to the pathogenesis of psychotic disorders.

CC984	30619848	Points in Mental Space: an Interdisciplinary Study of Imagery in Movement Creation	Jon May	The role of the extrastriate body area in action perception	"[""Paul E. Downing"", ""Yuhong Jiang"", ""Miles Shuman"", ""Nancy Kanwisher""]"	Numerous cortical regions respond to aspects of the human form and its actions. What is the contribution of the extrastriate body area (EBA) to this network? In particular, is the EBA involved in constructing a dynamic representation of observed actions? We scanned 16 participants with fMRI while they viewed two kinds of stimulus sequences. In the coherent condition, static frames from a movie of a single, intransitive whole-body action were presented in the correct order. In the incoherent condition, a series of frames from multiple actions (involving one actor) were presented. ROI analyses showed that the EBA, unlike area MT + and the posterior superior temporal sulcus, responded more to the incoherent than to the coherent conditions. Whole brain analyses revealed increased activation to the coherent sequences in parietal and frontal regions that have been implicated in the observation and control of movement. We suggest that the EBA response adapts when succeeding images depict relatively similar postures (coherent condition) compared to relatively different postures (incoherent condition). We propose that the EBA plays a unique role in the perception of action, by representing the static structure, rather than dynamic aspects, of the human form.	This region is thought to hold a human body representation (Downing et al., 2001) as well as a dynamic action representation (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2006) that may have contributed to both imagery creation and static movement creation.	"['Our fMRI data showed that the spatial-praxis and emotional imagery tasks shared activations in orbitofrontal cortex, middle temporal regions and  occipital cortex.', 'The orbitofrontal cortex has often been linked to sensory integration, in representing the affective value of reinforcers, and in decisionmaking and expectation (Kringelbach, 2005).', 'Common brain activations in middle temporal regions may reflect perceptual expertise responses usually associated with the nearby extrastriate cortex.', 'This region is thought to hold a human body representation (Downing et al., 2001) as well as a dynamic action representation (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2006) that may have contributed to both imagery creation and static movement creation.', 'Spatial-praxis imagery creation showed additional activation in the premotor and parietal cortices suggesting that sensorimotor representations were being used, even though motor behaviour was not being explicitly imagined.', 'Although based on a single dancer, our results are nonetheless in broad agreement with previous motor imagery studies (Iacoboni et al., 1999;Gr��zes and Decety, 2001;Calvo-Merino et al., 2005).', 'The activity related to static movement creation showed a very similar pattern of activity to the imagery creation tasks, showing how important imagery creation is in movement creation.', 'Analysis of the peak coordinates indicated that brain regions participating here were the same as those in studies where expert dancers watch familiar dance movements (Calvo-Merino et al., 2005).', 'The only major difference found between movement creation and imagery creation was an increased activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus, which has been associated with representations of goal directed actions in movement observation and execution (Iacoboni et al., 1999).', 'Moreover, this area has also been related to inhibition of prepotent responses (Christopoulos, Tobler, Bossaerts et al., 2009), but also in the multiple-demand network (Duncan, 2010), which is activated by many different cognitive demands including perceptual difficulty, novelty, and response conflict.', 'While it is possible that this activity reflects the novelty for our dancer of creating movement while remaining stationary, and having to inhibit her own movement, it could also reflect the need to synthesise different and novel ideas about movement to complete the movement creation task, as the subjective reports from Experiment 1 suggested.', 'While these data do provide some general support for the idea that both imagery and movement creation tasks are grounded in some elements of physical or action based thinking, they also raise some key questions concerning the wider mental context in which such thinking occurs and, given the clear limitations of the current fMRI and experience sampling work, how future research might usefully be directed.', ""The variety of strategies adopted within each task by our very creative dancer, which prevented our direct comparison of spatial-praxic and emotional movement creation tasks, also shows that it is necessary either to impose clearer constraints upon the experimental tasks (e.g., to adopt a first-person perspective for one's own dance, rather than a third-person perspective of other dancers), or if time and resources allow, to collect data from several runs in order to maximize task specific variations in relation to general variation in brain activity."", 'An interesting illustration of how our findings might be further pursued concerns creativity.', 'The neuroscience literature has given rise to considerable speculation concerning the role in creativity of the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral frontal areas implicated here in imagery and movement creation.', 'For example, Jung et al. (2010) showed that cortical thickness in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex correlates with higher creative achievement, while Limb and Braun (2008) showed a deactivation of dorsolateral frontal regions during jazz improvisation.', 'The latter finding highlights a potential contrast with our own data that might be pursued in further research.', 'Our movement creation tasks, as evidenced by both the experience sampling and fMRI data, appear to have large decisionmaking components.', 'In post-task debriefing our dancer noted that the movement creation phases involved attempting to remember the movement sequence.', 'In contrast, perhaps jazz or movement improvisation may minimise demands on memory and decision-making.', 'It would follow that a direct comparison of dance improvisation and phrase creation in the scanner should show differential activation of dorsolateral frontal cortex.', 'Such a finding, if realised, would support task-dependent activation not unlike the task dependence evidenced in our earlier experience sampling study.', 'Choreographic thinking will quite likely depend on a variety of neural components recruited in a task dependent manner and the exact nature of the dependence is, on the basis of this pilot work, clearly open to hypothesis development and direct test.']"	0	['This region is thought to hold a human body representation (Downing et al., 2001) as well as a dynamic action representation (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2006) that may have contributed to both imagery creation and static movement creation.']

This report documents work from a project commissioned by the Learning and Skills Development Agency (LSDA) to carry out an extensive review of research on post-16 learning styles, to evaluate the main models of learning styles, and to discuss the implications of learning styles for post-16 teaching and learning. The following research questions were addressed: What models of learning styles are influential and potentially influential? What empirical evidence is there to support the claims made for these models? What are the broad implications for pedagogy of these models? What empirical evidence is there that models of learning styles have an impact on studentsÕ learning? The project identified the range of models that are available and influential or potentially influential in research and practice, located these models within identifiable ÔfamiliesÕ of ideas about learning styles, evaluated the theories, claims and applications of these models, with a particular focus on evaluating the authorsÕ claims for reliability and validity, evaluated the claims made for the pedagogical implications of the selected models of learning styles, identified what gaps there are in current knowledge and what future research is needed in this area, and made recommendations and drew conclusions about the research field as a whole. This report provides a systematic and critical review of 13 learning style models. It discusses the appeal of learning styles as well as offering an overview of ways in which political and institutional contexts in the learning and skills sector affect the ways that learning styles might be put into practice. In conclusion, the implications for pedagogy are drawn out and recommendations and conclusions are offered for practitioners, policymakers and the research community. The report concludes that it matters fundamentally which model is chosen. A complementary report (indexed at TD/TNC 79.71) provides detailed reviews of the 13 major models of learning styles based on these research questions and objectives.

This is necessary for rational public health policy. Aims: To measure HRQoL decrement and loss of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with pure and comorbid forms of depressive and anxiety disorders and alcohol dependence. Method: A general population survey was conducted of Finns aged 30 years and over.

Dixon"", ""Richard G. Brereton""]"	Five methods for discrimination are described, namely Euclidean Distance to centroids (EDC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (based on the Mahalanobis distance and pooled variance covariance matrix), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) (based on the Mahalanobis distance and individual class variance covariance matrix Ñ non-Bayesian form), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (using soft boundaries and Radial Basis Functions), and illustrated graphically as boundary methods. The performance of each method was determined using four synthetic datasets each consisting of 200 samples half belonging to one of two classes, and a further two synthetic datasets containing 400 samples, again equally split between the two classes. In datasets 1 to 3, five variables were distributed multinormally, in dataset 1 the classes are distributed roughly circularly but with a significant degree of overlap, in dataset 2, the distribution is in elongated hyperellipsoids with small overlap, and in dataset 3 there is a region of complete overlap between classes. In dataset 4 two variables are distributed in a crescent shape. In datasets 5 and 6, 100 variables were generated from multinormal populations, some of which were potential discriminators, however a large proportion of the variables were designed to be uninformative. The methods were optimised using a training set and their performance evaluated using a test set: this was repeated 100 times for different test and training set splits. The average % correctly classified was computed for each class and model, as well as the model stability for each sample (the proportion of times the sample is classified into the same group over all 100 iterations). The conclusions are that the performance of the classifiers depends very much on the distribution of data. Approaches such as LVQ and SVMs that try to determine complex boundaries perform best when the data is not normally distributed such as in dataset 4, but can be prone to overfitting otherwise. QDA tends to perform best on multinormal data although it can be influenced by non-discriminative variables which show a difference in variance. It is recommended to look at the data structure prior to model building to determine the optimal type of model.	While SVMs are limited to numeric attributes and binary classification tasks, #AUTHOR_TAG and Brereton (2009) found SVMs outperformed other learners when modelling datasets that are not normally distributed.

Third (though again not quite uniquely; here, see chapters by Andrews, by Pollatsek & HyšnŠ, and by Rayner, Reichle & Pollatsek), it treats connected speech/ language rather than single-word processing. Despite these deviations from the central tendency, the chapter should be germane to the themes of the book in the sense that it concerns issues of lexical retrieval, of the relationship between language and conceptual knowledge/processing, and of the modularity or otherwise of di_erent aspects of language processing.

"[""N Unsworth"", ""B D Mcmillan""]"	Individual differences in mind wandering and reading comprehension were examined in the current study. In particular, individual differences in mind wandering, working memory capacity, interest in the current topic, motivation to do well on the task, and topic experience and their relations with reading comprehension were examined in the current study. Using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling it was found that variation in mind wandering while reading was influenced by working memory capacity, topic interest, and motivation. Furthermore, these same factors, along with topic experience, influenced individual differences in reading comprehension. Importantly, several factors had direct effects on reading comprehension (and mind wandering), while the relation between reading comprehension (and mind wandering) and other factors occurred via indirect effects. These results suggest that both domain-general and domain-specific factors contribute to mind wandering while reading and to reading comprehension.	#AUTHOR_TAG and McMillan (2013) thoughtsampled TUTs and obtained laboratory measures of working memory capacity and a number of self-report measures: motivation for the task, interest in the topic, and previous experience with the subject matter.

Eddington"", ""Timothy J. Strauman"", ""Roberto Cabeza""]"	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by the presence of disturbances in emotional processing. However, the neural correlates of these alterations, and how they may be affected by therapeutic interventions, remain unclear. The present study addressed these issues in a preliminary investigation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neural responses to positive, negative, and neutral pictures in unmedicated MDD patients (N = 22) versus controls (N = 14). After this initial scan, MDD patients were treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and scanned again after treatment. Within regions that showed pre-treatment differences between patients and controls, we tested the association between pre-treatment activity and subsequent treatment response as well as activity changes from pre- to post-treatment. This study yielded three main findings. First, prior to treatment and relative to controls, patients exhibited overall reduced activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), diminished discrimination between emotional and neutral items in the amygdala, caudate, and hippocampus, and enhanced responses to negative versus positive stimuli in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and right dorsolateral PFC. Second, CBT-related symptom improvement in MDD patients was predicted by increased activity at baseline in ventromedial PFC as well as the valence effects in the ATL and dorsolateral PFC. Third, from pre- to post-treatment, MDD patients exhibited overall increases in ventromedial PFC activation, enhanced arousal responses in the amygdala, caudate, and hippocampus, and a reversal of valence effects in the ATL. The study was limited by the relatively small sample that was able to complete both scan sessions, as well as an inability to determine the influence of comorbid disorders within the current sample. Nevertheless, components of the neural networks corresponding to emotion processing disturbances in MDD appear to resolve following treatment and are predictive of treatment response, possibly reflecting improvements in emotion regulation processes in response to CBT.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

CC917	81846122	Isotopic analysis of cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation associated with subarctic lichen and bryophyte species	Konstantin Gavazov	Chemical constituents and biochemistry	"[""R Mues""]"	Only 30 years ago the chemistry of bryophytes was virtually unknown. Recent research on the biology of bryophytes and progress in analytical techniques has resulted in a deeper knowledge about the chemical constituents of bryophytes, although our understanding of their biochemical processes, especially biosynthetic pathways, compared to vascular plants, is still rather poor. In the first part of this chapter the present state of the art regarding the chemistry of bryophytes will be presented, the second part deals with some aspects of chemosystematics, and in the third part knowledge of the biochemistry of bryophytes is summarized. A recent thorough and comprehensive review on the topic has been published by Asakawa (1995). A further review, in 1997, on Òheterocyclic compounds in bryophytesÓ was published by the same author. He deals mainly with secondary metabolites and does not mention inorganic compounds. Primary metabolites are partly discussed, e.g., lipids, carbohydrates, and phaeophytins. Biochemistry was not a topic of his review; this field of research was recently surveyed in Chopra and Bhatla (1990) and Rudolph (1990). In the section ÔChemistry of bryophytesÕ, present knowledge about inorganic compounds and primary metabolites, their structural analogues, and other ubiquitous compounds in bryophytes will be discussed, followed by the main classes of secondary products. The examples mentioned here are selected from recent original papers not cited in Asakawa (1995, 1997); they are more or less confined to those compounds typical of bryophytes in general.	Liverworts are known for rich composition of secondary compounds (Asakawa 1995(Asakawa , 2004#AUTHOR_TAG 2000), many of which exhibit antimicrobial properties (Asakawa 2008).

The purpose of this paper is to review and critique research into the roles of speech output for communication partners, learners, and learner-partner dyads. Research on partner - oriented roles is reviewed in terms of attitudes and perceived communicative competence, and communicative behavior. Learner-oriented roles of speech output are summarized in terms of graphic symbol learning, communicative functions and social regulation, learner preference, challenging behaviors, natural speech production, comprehension, and literacy. Roles for the learner - partner dyad include changes to interaction patterns. Methodological issues are discussed and practical implications are drawn where appropriate.

Thomas Vanoutrive	Employee trip reduction in Southern California: First year results	"[""Genevieve Giuliano"", ""Keith Hwang"", ""Martin Wachs""]"	Trip reduction policies are increasingly utilized in U.S. metropolitan areas to address congestion and air quality problems. These policies typically focus on the journey to work and are aimed at reducing the amount of drive-alone commuting by providing transit and ride-sharing incentives. Severe air quality problems in Southern California have prompted the air pollution control agency for the Los Angeles metropolitan area to enact Regulation XV. The regulation requires employers to develop and implement a trip reduction program to achieve specified ride-sharing goals. It is the most ambitious and far-reaching program of its kind implemented to date, and offers a unique opportunity to determine whether such programs can significantly affect travel behavior.

Heget"", ""James P. Bagian"", ""Caryl Z. Lee"", ""John W. Gosbee""]"	In 1998 the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) created the National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) to lead the effort to reduce adverse events and close calls systemwide. NCPS's aim is to foster a culture of safety in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) by developing and providing patient safety programs and delivering standardized tools, methods, and initiatives to the 163 VA facilities.To create a system-oriented approach to patient safety, NCPS looked for models in fields such as aviation, nuclear power, human factors, and safety engineering. Core concepts included a non-punitive approach to patient safety activities that emphasizes systems-based learning, the active seeking out of close calls, which are viewed as opportunities for learning and investigation, and the use of interdisciplinary teams to investigate close calls and adverse events through a root cause analysis (RCA) process. Participation by VA facilities and networks was voluntary. NCPS has always aimed to develop a program that would be applicable both within the VA and beyond.NCPS's full patient safety program was tested and implemented throughout the VA system from November 1999 to August 2000. Program components included an RCA system for use by caregivers at the front line, a system for the aggregate review of RCA results, information systems software, alerts and advisories, and cognitive acids. Following program implementation, NCPS saw a 900-fold increase in reporting of close calls of high-priority events, reflecting the level of commitment to the program by VHA leaders and staff.

Extending the previous work, we investigate conditions under which the FQH effect can be achieved for bosons on a lattice with an effective magnetic field and finite onsite interaction. Furthermore, we characterize the ground state in such systems by calculating Chern numbers which can provide direct signatures of topological order and explore regimes where the characterization in terms of wavefunction overlap fails. We also discuss various issues which are relevant for the practical realization of such FQH states with ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, including the presence of the long-range dipole interaction which can improve the energy gap and stabilize the ground state. We also investigate a new detection technique based on Bragg spectroscopy to probe these system in an experimental realization.Comment: 18 pages, 12 figure	For a filling factor with ___ 1 atom per site, the quantum Hall regime then becomes reachable in presence of moderate atomic interactions [11,19,20,#AUTHOR_TAG,22].

A population of 88 Jordanian manufacturing firms, registered on the Amman Stock Exchange, was targeted using a cross-sectional survey employing a questionnaire method of data collection. The results of the data analysis indicate a significant relationship between competitive priorities and competitive advantage. The research suggests that recognising and nurturing this relationship provides the master key for a firm to survive in a turbulent environment. Therefore, operational and marketing strategies should place emphasis on competitive priorities such as quality, cost, flexibility and delivery to achieve, develop and maintain competitive advantage.

Thompson"", ""Aya Meltzer-Asscher"", ""Soojin Cho"", ""Jiyeon Lee"", ""Christina Wieneke"", ""Sandra Weintraub"", ""M.-Marsel Mesulam""]"	The paper reports findings derived from three experiments examining syntactic and morphosyntactic processing in individuals with agrammatic and logopenic variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA-G and PPA-L, respectively) and stroke-induced agrammatic and anomic aphasia (StrAg and StrAn, respectively). We examined comprehension and production of canonical and noncanonical sentence structures and production of tensed and nontensed verb forms using constrained tasks in experiments 1 and 2, using the Northwestern Assessment of Verbs and Sentences (NAVS [57]) and the Northwestern Assessment of Verb Inflection (NAVI, Thompson and Lee, experimental version) test batteries, respectively. Experiment 3 examined free narrative samples, focusing on syntactic and morphosyntactic measures, i.e. production of grammatical sentences, noun to verb ratio, open-class to closed-class word production ratio, and the production of correctly inflected verbs. Results indicate that the two agrammatic groups (i.e., PPA-G and StrAg) pattern alike on syntactic and morphosyntactic measures, showing more impaired noncanonical compared to canonical sentence comprehension and production and greater difficulties producing tensed compared to nontensed verb forms. Their spontaneous speech also contained significantly fewer grammatical sentences and correctly inflected verbs, and they produced a greater proportion of nouns compared to verbs, than healthy speakers. In contrast, PPA-L and StrAn individuals did not display these deficits, and performed significantly better than the agrammatic groups on these measures. The findings suggest that agrammatism, whether induced by degenerative disease or stroke, is associated with characteristic deficits in syntactic and morphosyntactic processing. We therefore recommend that linguistically sophisticated tests and narrative analysis procedures be used to systematically evaluate the linguistic ability of individuals with PPA, contributing to our understanding of the language impairments of different PPA variants.

CC1344	2068614	Scanning the Parameter Space of Holographic Superconductors	Obinna Umeh	Anti de Sitter space and holography	"[""Edward Witten""]"	Recently, it has been proposed by Maldacena that large $N$ limits of certain conformal field theories in $d$ dimensions can be described in terms of supergravity (and string theory) on the product of $d+1$-dimensional $AdS$ space with a compact manifold. Here we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those of supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on $AdS_5\times {\bf S}^5$ match with the chiral operators of $\N=4$ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. With some further assumptions, one can deduce a Hamiltonian version of the correspondence and show that the $\N=4$ theory has a large $N$ phase transition related to the thermodynamics of $AdS$ black holes.Comment: 40 pp.; additional references and assorted correction	The AdS/CFT dictionary [#AUTHOR_TAG,33] relates the constant coefficients of the asymptotic solutions (equation (2.14)) to physical quantities in the boundary theory.

Foliar _15N values varied by about 10% among species within each of two moist tussock tundra sites. Differences in 15N contents among species or plant groups were consistent across moist tussock tundra at several other sites and across five other tundra types at a single site. Ericaceous species had the lowest _15N values, ranging between about -8 to -6ä. Foliar 15N contents increased progressively in birch, willows and sedges to maximum _15N values of about +2ä in sedges. Soil 15N contents in tundra ecosystems at our two most intensively studied sites increased with depth and _15N values were usually higher for soils than for plants. Isotopic fractionations during soil N transformations and possibly during plant N uptake could lead to observed differences in 15N contents among plant species and between plants and soils. Patterns of variation in 15N content among species indicate that tundra plants acquire nitrogen in extremely nutrient-poor environments by competitive partitioning of the overall N pool. Differences in plant N sources, rooting depth, mycorrhizal associations, forms of N taken up, and other factors controlling plant N uptake are possible causes of variations in _15N values of tundra plant species.

CC2304	30780864	Viral infection of human lung macrophages increases pdl1 expression via ifn	Karl Staples	Inhibition of pulmonary antibacterial defense by interferon-Î³ during recovery from influenza infection	"[""Keer Sun"", ""Dennis W Metzger""]"	Secondary bacterial infection often occurs after pulmonary virus infection and is a common cause of severe disease in humans, yet the mechanisms responsible for this viral-bacterial synergy in the lung are only poorly understood. We now report that pulmonary interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) produced during T cell responses to influenza infection in mice inhibits initial bacterial clearance from the lung by alveolar macrophages. This suppression of phagocytosis correlates with lung IFN-gamma abundance, but not viral burden, and leads to enhanced susceptibility to secondary pneumococcal infection, which can be prevented by IFN-gamma neutralization after influenza infection. Direct inoculation of IFN-gamma can mimic influenza infection and downregulate the expression of the class A scavenger receptor MARCO on alveolar macrophages. Thus, IFN-gamma, although probably facilitating induction of specific anti-influenza adaptive immunity, suppresses innate protection against extracellular bacterial pathogens in the lung.	Subsequent studies have suggested that it is the cytokines released by lymphocytes, such as IFN�_ and IL-10 that mediate the suppressive effects of virus [1,[22]#AUTHOR_TAG[24].

Chowdhury"", ""T. Sharot"", ""P. Dayan"", ""E. Duzel"", ""R. J. Dolan""]"	Dopamine is widely observed to signal anticipation of future rewards and thus thought to be a key contributor to affectively charged decision making. However, the experiments supporting this view have not dissociated rewards from the actions that lead to, or are occasioned by, them. Here, we manipulated dopamine pharmacologically and examined the effect on a task that explicitly dissociates action and reward value. We show that dopamine enhanced the neural representation of rewarding actions, without significantly affecting the representation of reward value as such. Thus, increasing dopamine levels with levodopa selectively boosted striatal and substantia nigra/ventral tegmental representations associated with actions leading to reward, but not with actions leading to the avoidance of punishment. These findings highlight a key role for dopamine in the generation of appetitively motivated actions.

Pyrroles were determined using Ehrlich's reagent under acid conditions. Adduct formation in plasma proteins was induced by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in a dose-dependent manner. The simultaneous addition of melatonin to the incubation medium with 100 mM H(2)O(2) prevented the formation of Ehrlich adducts. This inhibitory effect of melatonin on adduct formation was significant at concentrations higher than 10 nM melatonin. When melatonin was added to the medium 60 min before adding H(2)O(2), no significant difference was observed. The effect of melatonin was also compared with other known antioxidants such as vitamin E (Trolox) and vitamin C; the order of potency of the antioxidants was melatonin>vitamin E>vitamin C. In conclusion, the results presented in this paper add new perspectives to other well known antioxidant properties of melatonin such as prevention of protein pyrrolization.

Too often 'mental maps' act like blinkers rather than guides - preventing us from acting effectively. Rafael Ramirez (from the Preface) The Value Net A Tool for Competitive Strategy Cinzia Parolini SDA Bocconi, School of Management, Milan, Italy Faced with a continuously changing, and an increasingly competitive, business environment, strategic analysts and senior managers are still reluctant to forsake the familiar and traditional tools and models which were conceived in the very different world of the 1970s and 1980s. However, these methods of analysis are less and less applicable to the blurred and shifting boundaries of today's business world. This book challenges the tools and models that we use when looking at how value is created, shaped and maintained and presents a new and completely viable methodology - the value net. This methodology provides the reader with a new way of dealing with value in the modern environment. Above all it can be used for the analysis of competitive systems that cannot adequately be analysed using established models. Supported by an impressive array of case studies from industries with which most people will be readily familiar - books, online trading, music, coffee etc. - the book argues that in order to remain competitive, strategists, planners and managers should not use yesterday's tools for today's decisions. This well-structured and highly readable book will help create a brand new perspective in strategic analysis and formulation and will interest managers, strategy consultants, MBA and Executive students in these areas.

CC762	36045385	Mobile Termination, Network Externalities, and Consumer Expectations	Sjaak Hurkens	Market structure in congestible markets	"[""In Ho Lee"", ""Robin Mason""]"	This paper analyses market structure of industries that are subject to both positive and negative network effects. The size of a firm determines the quality of its product: when network effects are positive, a larger firm is of higher quality; when the effects are negative, a larger firm's product is of lower quality. Consumers have heterogeneous preferences towards quality (firm size), and firms compete in prices. Equilibria are characterised: for example, in any asymmetric equilibrium, it must be that congestion is not too severe.

Lenucci"", ""Gian-Pietro Di Sansebastiano"", ""Giuseppe Dalessandro"", ""Giulia De Lorenzo"", ""Gabriella Piro""]"	P>The secretory pathway in plants involves sustained traffic to the cell wall, as matrix components, polysaccharides and proteins reach the cell wall through the endomembrane system. We studied the secretion pattern of cell-wall proteins in tobacco protoplasts and leaf epidermal cells using fluorescent forms of a pectin methylesterase inhibitor protein (PMEI1) and a polygalacturonase inhibitor protein (PGIP2). The two most representative protein fusions, secGFP-PMEI1 and PGIP2-GFP, reached the cell wall by passing through ER and Golgi stacks but using distinct mechanisms. secGFP-PMEI1 was linked to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and stably accumulated in the cell wall, regulating the activity of the endogenous pectin methylesterases (PMEs) that are constitutively present in this compartment. A mannosamine-induced non-GPI-anchored form of PMEI1 as well as a form (PMEI1-GFP) that was unable to bind membranes failed to reach the cell wall, and accumulated in the Golgi stacks. In contrast, PGIP2-GFP moved as a soluble cargo protein along the secretory pathway, but was not stably retained in the cell wall, due to internalization to an endosomal compartment and eventually the vacuole. Stable localization of PGIP2 in the wall was observed only in the presence of a specific fungal endopolygalacturonase ligand in the cell wall. Both secGFP-PMEI1 and PGIP2-GFP sorting were distinguishable from that of a secreted GFP, suggesting that rigorous and more complex controls than the simple mechanism of bulk flow are the basis of cell-wall growth and differentiation	Overexpression of DN variants to inhibit specific functions seems to offer a better tool to affect the molecular machinery leaving no options to the plant cell to adapt and mask the effect (Rehman et al., 2008;Silva et al., 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011;De Benedictis et al., 2012).

Both are key components in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders, yet the neural circuitry that mediates avoidance is underexplored. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging greater hemodynamic activation of the nucleus accumbens was found during active avoidance, whereas greater deactivation of the nucleus accumbens was observed during passive avoidance. These findings extend the role of the NAcc from purely reward-based action-contingencies, to one that also involves either emitting or withholding a response to avoid harm. Critically, the degree of activation and deactivation of the NAcc during avoidance was associated with individual levels of anxiety, which supports the idea that the NAcc may play a key role in the etiology and maintenance of aberrant avoidance behaviors in disorders of anxiety.Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We generate implications and test the model empirically using a proprietary dataset of executive bonus plans. Consistent with our model, we find that discretion is less important in determining CEO pay than the pay of other executives. We also find that discretion is relatively important in determining executive bonuses at larger and privately held firms and that more diversified firms are relatively less likely to compensate their business unit managers based on firm-wide performance. Finally, we consider (and largely dismiss) tax-related explanations for our results.	A smaller literature considers these (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG & Oyer 2003;Gibbs et al. 2004).

CC1775	81288194	On universality of critical behavior in the focusing nonlinear schrodinger, equation elliptic umbilic catastrophe and the tritronquee solution to the painleve-i equation	B Dubrovin	Pattern formation outside of equilibrium	"[""M. C. Cross"", ""P. C. Hohenberg""]"	"A comprehensive review of spatiotemporal pattern formation in systems driven away from equilibrium is presented, with emphasis on comparisons between theory and quantitative experiments. Examples include patterns in hydrodynamic systems such as thermal convection in pure fluids and binary mixtures, Taylor-Couette flow, parametric-wave instabilities, as well as patterns in solidification fronts, nonlinear optics, oscillatory chemical reactions and excitable biological media. The theoretical starting point is usually a set of deterministic equations of motion, typically in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations. These are sometimes supplemented by stochastic terms representing thermal or instrumental noise, but for macroscopic systems and carefully designed experiments the stochastic forces are often negligible. An aim of theory is to describe solutions of the deterministic equations that are likely to be reached starting from typical initial conditions and to persist at long times. A unified description is developed, based on the linear instabilities of a homogeneous state, which leads naturally to a classification of patterns in terms of the characteristic wave vector q0 and frequency o0 of the instability. Type Is systems (o0=0, q00) are stationary in time and periodic in space; type IIIo systems (o00, q0=0) are periodic in time and uniform in space; and type Io systems (o00, q00) are periodic in both space and time. Near a continuous (or supercritical) instability, the dynamics may be accurately described via ""amplitude equations,"" whose form is universal for each type of instability. The specifics of each system enter only through the nonuniversal coefficients. Far from the instability threshold a different universal description known as the ""phase equation"" may be derived, but it is restricted to slow distortions of an ideal pattern. For many systems appropriate starting equations are either not known or too complicated to analyze conveniently. It is thus useful to introduce phenomenological order-parameter models, which lead to the correct amplitude equations near threshold, and which may be solved analytically or numerically in the nonlinear regime away from the instability. The above theoretical methods are useful in analyzing ""real pattern effects"" such as the influence of external boundaries, or the formation and dynamics of defects in ideal structures. An important element in nonequilibrium systems is the appearance of deterministic chaos. A greal deal is known about systems with a small number of degrees of freedom displaying ""temporal chaos,"" where the structure of the phase space can be analyzed in detail. For spatially extended systems with many degrees of freedom, on the other hand, one is dealing with spatiotemporal chaos and appropriate methods of analysis need to be developed. In addition to the general features of nonequilibrium pattern formation discussed above, detailed reviews of theoretical and experimental work on many specific systems are presented. These include Rayleigh-Benard convection in a pure fluid, convection in binary-fluid mixtures, electrohydrodynamic convection in nematic liquid crystals, Taylor-Couette flow between rotating cylinders, parametric surface waves, patterns in certain open flow systems, oscillatory chemical reactions, static and dynamic patterns in biological media, crystallization fronts, and patterns in nonlinear optics. A concluding section summarizes what has and has not been accomplished, and attempts to assess the prospects for the future"	One of the striking features that distinguishes this equation from, say, the defocusing case is the phenomenon of modulation (or Benjamin-Feir) instability (Agrawal 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG and Hohenberg 1993;Forest and Lee 1986), that is, self-induced amplitude modulation of a continuous wave propagating in a nonlinear medium, with subsequent generation of localized structures.

CC310	206252006	The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	Simon Dietz	Has Economic Analysis Improved Regulatory Decisions?	"[""Robert W Hahn"", ""Paul C Tetlock""]"	In response to the increasing impact of regulation, several governments have introduced economic analysis as a way of trying to improve regulatory policy. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of government-supported economic analysis of regulation. We find that there is growing interest in the use of economic tools, such as benefit-cost analysis; however, the quality of analysis in the U.S. and European Union frequently fails to meet widely accepted guidelines. Furthermore, the relationship between analysis and policy decisions is tenuous. To address this situation, we recommend pursuing an agenda in which economics plays a more central role in regulatory decision making. In addition, we suggest that prediction markets could help improve regulatory policy and improve measurement of the impact of regulation.	Perhaps unsurprisingly, the reality of carrying out benefit-cost analysis of federal regulations falls short of best practice, and it does not appear to be having a significant impact on many regulatory decisions, except higher-profile cases (#AUTHOR_TAG and Tetlock 2008).

CC2336	16229222	Comparing live to recorded speech in training the perception of spectrally shifted noise-vocoded speech	Andrew Faulkner	A procedure for measuring auditory and audiovisual speech-reception thresholds for sentences in noise: Rationale, evaluation, and recommendations for use	"["" Macleod""]"	The strategy for measuring speech-reception thresholds for sentences in noise advocated by Plomp and Mimpen (Audiology, 18, 43-52, 1979) was modified to create a reliable test for measuring the difficulty which listeners have in speech reception, both auditorily and audio-visually. The test materials consist of 10 lists of 15 short sentences of homogeneous intelligibility when presented acoustically, and of different, but still homogeneous, intelligibility when presented audio-visually, in white noise. Homogeneity was achieved by applying phonetic and linguistic principles at the stage of compilation, followed by pilot testing and balancing of properties. To run the test, lists are presented at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) determined by an up-down psychophysical rule so as to estimate auditory and audio-visual speech-reception thresholds, defined as the SNRs at which the three content words in each sentence are identified correctly on 50% of trials. These thresholds provide measures of a subject's speech-reception abilities. The difference between them provides a measure of the benefit received from vision. It is shown that this measure is closely related to the accuracy with which subjects lip-read words in sentences with no acoustical information. In data from normally hearing adults, the standard deviations (s.d.s) of estimates of auditory speech reception threshold in noise (SRTN), audio-visual SRTN, and visual benefit are 1.2, 2.0, and 2.3 dB, respectively. Graphs are provided with which to estimate the trade-off between reliability and the number of lists presented, and to assess the significance of deviant scores from individual subjects.

CC1478	20652885	Taxon Sampling and the Optimal Rates of Evolution for Phylogenetic Inference	Jeffrey Townsend	Evaluation of the Strategy of Long-Branch Subdivision to Improve the Accuracy of Phylogenetic Methods	"[""Steven Poe""]"	"Methods for reconstructing evolutionary history are sensitive to the number and position of taxa included in the analysis (e.g., Gauthier et al., 1988; Hendy and Penny, 1989; Lecointre et al., 1993; Poe, 1998). Figure 1 illustrates this phenomenon using parsimony analyses of a sample of four Anolis lizard species from a large matrix of morphological and molecular data (Poe, 2001). Any of the three possible relationships for these species can be obtained by including appropriate additional species in the same analysis. In addition to demonstrating the instability of results relative to taxon sampling, this example shows conclusively that addition of taxa may be beneficial to the accuracy of a phylogenetic analysis but also may be detrimental to accuracy. This conclusion holds because it is possible to change any of the topological results either by adding or by subtracting taxa, and even though we do not know which of these three trees is the true tree, we can assume that one of them is correct and two of them are wrong. One might think that the sensitivity to taxon sampling shown in Figure 1 is restricted to certain methods or to poorly supported trees. Unfortunately this is not the case, as shown in the example in Figure 2. These trees were reconstructed using the mitochondrial DNA sequence data of Jackman et al. (1999) for Anolis lizards. Tree a in Figure 2 is obtained when these taxa are analyzed alone using maximum likelihood and minimum evolution under complex models (HKY + G; Hasegawa et al., 1985; Yang, 1994; parameter values estimated from data) and using parsimony with equal weights for all character changes. Tree b is obtained using these same methods but running the analyses including three other lizard species. This comparison shows that sensitivity to taxon sampling may occur even with strongly supported trees and diverse methods of estimation (and shows that high bootstrap values and strongly supported congruence between methods are not necessarily predictors of accuracy). The above examples show the potentially extreme sensitivity of phylogenetic methods to taxon sampling, but they are of little help in devising a taxon sampling strategy for maximizing the accuracy of a phylogenetic analysis. When a researcher is interested in the relationships of a set of clades from which exemplar taxa are chosen, is it better or worse to include additional taxa in the analysis? Clearly, simply including more taxa without additional character information can be detrimental to accuracy, because more characters are needed to resolve a greater number of nodes. However, addition of more taxa adds information about evolutionary history (e.g., Gauthier et al., 1988), which seems likely to have a positive effect on accuracy. Given these potentially opposing effects, what is the best taxon-sampling strategy for maximizing the accuracy of phylogenetic analyses? Phylogenies that include lineages that have undergone extensive evolution are difficult to reconstruct because of the phenomenon of long branch attraction (Felsenstein, 1978; Huelsenbeck and Hillis, 1993). Thus, a beneficial sampling strategy might involve shortening long branches by including additional taxa, assuming that such taxa exist (Hendy and Penny, 1989). This strategy has been evaluated for the parsimony method by Graybeal (1998) and by Poe and Swofford (1999). Graybeal fulfilled Hendy and Penny's (1989) prediction that long-branch subdivision can have a strong beneficial effect on the accuracy of estimation of four-taxon trees in the Felsenstein zone of two long opposing branches and a short internal branch. Poe and Swofford (1999) examined a wider range of model trees and discovered several conditions of the kind discussed by Zharkikh and Li (1993) under which long-branch subdivision was detrimental to accuracy. The taxon sampling strategy of long-branch subdivision (LBS) has not been examined for methods other than parsimony. Poe and Swofford (1999) suggested that phylogenetic methods that take branch lengths into account are less likely to be affected by the problems of LBS that afflicted their application of the parsimony method. Pollock and Bruno (2000:1858) concluded that ""the notion that added taxa can decrease accuracy . . . should be abandoned as an artifact of parsimony."" Although it seems likely that LBS will be beneficial when the model"	In general, empirical and simulation results have justified a claim that greater in-group taxon sampling permits the effective usage of faster evolving characters (Graybeal 1998;Hillis 1998;#AUTHOR_TAG 2003;Hedtke et al. 2006), leading to a prediction of a slightly higher optimal rate.

CC1602	1683841	Evolution in Archaeology	Stephen Shennan	Sedation and Cladistics: The Difference between Anagenetic and Cladogenetic Evolution	"[""R. Lee Lyman"", ""Michael J. O\u2019Brien""]"	We have argued in numerous venues that a significant step in archaeological research involves the construction of evolutionary histories of cultural phenomena (Lyman and O'Brien 1998; O'Brien and Lyman 2000a, 2000b, 2002a, 2003a). These histories can concern artifacts of any scale, from design motifs on ceramic vessels, to projectile-point shapes, to architectural forms, to tool kits. A critical aspect of constructing these histories involves ascertaining the mode of evolution, by which we mean the form of the evolutionary history of a lineage. Did the members of the lineage change in a linear fashion (perhaps projectile points got consistently longer over time)? Did the members diversify over time (did the projectile points in one population get longer whereas those in another population got shorter)? Was there hybridization (did a population with long, narrow points exchange ideas with a population having short, wide points so as to produce a new kind of point)? Was there a combination of these modes of change? The evolution of a lineage is historical in the particularistic sense of being contingency bound (Simpson 1963, 1970)-minimally, the gene pool has unique spatial and temporal coordinates (Cooper 2002; Gould 1986). This does not mean, however, that determining the evolutionary history of some set of phenomena is less of a scientific endeavor than, say, calculating the atomic weight of an element (Lyman and O'Brien 2004). Indeed, it is precisely the theoretically driven nature of research on particularistic evolutionary histories that makes those histories empirically testable. The use of a theory with empirical in~plications is arguably a necessary condition of any science (Moore 2002).

Saha"", ""J.G. Scott"", ""D. Varghese"", ""J.J.

We had the opportunity to explore the association between DLE and both individual- and area-level measures of socio-economic disadvantage.Subjects were drawn from the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing 2007. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to identify DLE, common psychiatric disorders, and physical disorders. Individual-level and area-level socio-economic disadvantage measures were available based on variables including income, educational attainment, employment status, and housing. We examined the relationship between the variables of interest using logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounding factors.Of the 8773 subjects, 8.4% (n=776) positively endorsed one or more DLE. DLE screen items were more likely to be endorsed by those who were (a) younger, (b) never married, or widowed, separated or divorced status, (c) migrants, or (d) living in rented houses. There were significant associations between socio-economic disadvantage and increased DLE endorsement, and this was found for both individual-level and area-level measures of socio-economic disadvantage. In general, the associations remained significant after adjusting for a range of potential confounding factors and in planned sensitivity analyses.DLE are associated with socio-economic disadvantage in the general population. We speculate that the link between socio-economic disadvantage and DLE may be mediated by psychosocial stress and general psychological distress.Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This topic is receiving increasing attention, in part because recent studies have reached a con-fusing diversity of conclusions about the effects of taxonomic sampling. For in-stance, contrast the conclusions reached in two recent papers on this topic: If the evolutionary question of interest does not re-quire a large number of taxa, it seems best to use fewer taxa because larger trees are more likely to contain inconsistent branches. (Kim, 1996:372) Including large numbers of taxa in an analysis may be the best way to ensure phylogenetic accuracy. (H illis, 1996:131) These recommendations, taken at face val-ue, appear to be in direct con - ict w ith re-gard to advice on taxon sampling. The pa-pers in this issue extend these studies and modify these recommendations on the ba-sis of analyses of real data sets (Soltis et al., 1998; Poe, 1998), simulations (Graybeal, 1998), and theoretical considerations (Kim, 1998).

Sharpe""]"	The discovery of new functions for the original B7 family members, together with the identification of additional B7 and CD28 family members, have revealed new ways in which the B7:CD28 family regulates T cell activation and tolerance. B7-1/B7-2:CD28 interactions not only promote initial T cell activation but also regulate self-tolerance by supporting CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell homeostasis. CTLA-4 can exert its inhibitory effects in both B7-1/B7-2 dependent and independent fashions. B7-1 and B7-2 can signal bidirectionally by engaging CD28 and CTLA-4 on T cells and by delivering signals into B7-expressing cells. The five new B7 family members, ICOS ligand, PD-L1 (B7-H1), PD-L2 (B7-DC), B7-H3, and B7-H4 (B7x/B7-S1) are expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells as well as on cells within nonlymphoid organs, providing new means for regulating T cell activation and tolerance in peripheral tissues. The new CD28 families members, ICOS, PD-1, and BTLA, are inducibly expressed on T cells, and they have important roles in regulating previously activated T cells. PD-1 and BTLA also are expressed on B cells and may have broader immunoregulatory functions. The ICOS:ICOSL pathway appears to be particularly important for stimulating effector T cell responses and T cell-dependent B cell responses, but it also has an important role in regulating T cell tolerance. In addition, the PD-1:PD-L1/PD-L2 pathway plays a critical role in regulating T cell activation and tolerance. In this review, we revisit the roles of the B7:CD28 family members in regulating immune responses, and we discuss their therapeutic potential.

Vogelstein's path model of colon cancer was a pioneering contribution to cancer research. Since then, several attempts have been made at obtaining mathematical models of cancer progression, devising learning algorithms, and applying these to cross-sectional data. Beerenwinkel et al. provided, what they coined, EM-like algorithms for Oncogenetic Trees (OTs) and mixtures of such. Given the small size of current and future data sets, it is important to minimize the number of parameters of a model. For this reason, we too focus on tree-based models and introduce Hidden-variable Oncogenetic Trees (HOTs). In contrast to OTs, HOTs allow for errors in the data and thereby provide more realistic modeling. We also design global structural EM algorithms for learning HOTs and mixtures of HOTs (HOT-mixtures). The algorithms are global in the sense that, during the M-step, they find a structure that yields a global maximum of the expected complete log-likelihood rather than merely one that improves it. The algorithm for single HOTs performs very well on reasonable-sized data sets, while that for HOT-mixtures requires data sets of sizes obtainable only with tomorrow's more cost-efficient technologies.

As a running example, they illustrate the capabilities of the Experience Sampling Program (ESP), their configurable, freely distributable software environment for designing and running experience-sampling studies on Palm Pilots and Windows CE palmtops.	By probing immediate self-report of inner experience, this method enables researchers to measure a person's momentary thoughts, feelings and action-tendencies than by asking through more retrospective recall methods (for more detail see Feldman, #AUTHOR_TAG, 2001;Myin-Germeys , 2009;Smyth et al., 2001;Stone & Shiffman, 1994).

CC2240	81800077	Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	Fabio Reale	On the importance of background subtraction in the analysis of coronal loops observed with TRACE	"[""S. Terzo"", ""F. Reale""]"	In the framework of TRACE coronal observations, we compare the analysis and diagnostics of a loop after subtracting the background with two different and independent methods. The dataset includes sequences of images in the 171 A, 195 A filter bands of TRACE. One background subtraction method consists in taking as background values those obtained from interpolation between concentric strips around the analyzed loop. The other method is a pixel-to-pixel subtraction of the final image when the loop had completely faded out, already used by Reale & Ciaravella 2006. We compare the emission distributions along the loop obtained with the two methods and find that they are considerably different. We find differences as well in the related derive filter ratio and temperature profiles. In particular, the pixel-to-pixel subtraction leads to coherent diagnostics of a cooling loop. With the other subtraction the diagnostics are much less clear. The background subtraction is a delicate issue in the analysis of a loop. The pixel-to-pixel subtraction appears to be more reliable, but its application is not always possible. Subtraction from interpolation between surrounding regions can produce higher systematic errors, because of intersecting structures and of the large amount of subtracted emission in TRACE observations.Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure	The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics, such as the passband and the point response function: it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue (e.g., Del Zanna and Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG and Reale, 2010).

Thomas Vanoutrive	Going soft On how subjective variables explain modal choices for leisure travel	"[""Veronique Van\u00a0Acker"", ""Kobe Boussauw"", ""Frank Witlox""]"	Most studies on the link between the built environment and modal choice characterize and model this relationship by objectively measureable characteristics such as density and diversity. Recently, within the debate on residential self-selection, attention has also been paid to the importance of subjective influences such as the individual's perception of the built environment and his/her residential attitudes and preferences, resulting in models that take account of both the objective and subjective characteristics of the built environment. However, self-selection might occur on other points than residential location as well. Expanding the analysis to also include both objective and subjective characteristics at other model levels (i.e., not only stage of life characteristics but also personal lifestyles; not only car availability but also travel attitudes, not only modal choice but also mode specific attitudes) is the purpose of this paper. To this end, a modal choice model for leisure trips is developed using data on personal lifestyles and attitudes, collected via an Internet survey, and estimated using a path model consisting of a set of simultaneously estimated equations between observed variables. While controlling for subjective lifestyles and attitudes, the effects of the built environment and car availability on modal choice can more correctly be determined and thus insights into self-selection mechanisms can be gained. Moreover, we compared the results of a model with and without these subjective influences. The results show that subjective characteristics at various model levels are important decisive factors of modal choices for leisure travel	Accordingly, what people at your workplace think and do (the subjective norm, corporate culture) influences your travel behaviour (Bonham and Koth, 2010;Heinen et al., 2011;McDonald, 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).

CC2207	81800077	Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	Fabio Reale	A Fluxâ€Tube Tectonics Model for Solar Coronal Heating Driven by the Magnetic Carpet	"[""E. R. Priest""]"	We explore some of the consequences of the magnetic carpet for coronal heating. Observations show that most of the magnetic flux in the quiet Sun emerges as ephemeral regions and then quickly migrates to super-granule boundaries. The original ephemeral concentrations fragment, merge, and cancel over a time period of 10-40 hr. Since the network photospheric flux is likely to be concentrated in units of 10(17) Mx or smaller, there will be myriads of coronal separatrix surfaces caused by the highly fragmented photospheric magnetic configuration in the quiet network. We suggest that the formation and dissipation of current sheets along these separatrices are an important contribution to coronal heating. The dissipation of energy along sharp boundaries we call, by analogy with geophysical plate tectonics, the tectonics model of coronal heating. Similar to the case on Earth, the relative motions of the photospheric sources will drive the formation and dissipation of current sheets along a hierarchy of such separatrix surfaces at internal dislocations in the corona. In our preliminary assessment of such dissipation we find that the heating is fairly uniform along the separatrices, so that each elementary coronal flux tube is heated uniformly. However, 95% of the photospheric flux closes low down in the magnetic carpet and the remaining 5% forms large-scale connections, so the magnetic carpet will be heated more effectively than the large-scale corona. This suggests that unresolved observations of coronal loops should exhibit enhanced heating near their feet in the carpet, while the upper parts of large-scale loops should be heated rather uniformly but less strongly.	Small-scale structuring is already involved in the magnetic carpet scenario and  (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2002, see also Section 4.4).

CC1990	81739181	High photobiont diversity in the common European soil crust lichen Psora decipiens	Ulrike Ruprecht	The influence of competition between lichen colonization and erosion on the evolution of soil surfaces in the Tabernas badlands (SE Spain) and its landscape effects	"[""R. L\u00e1zaro"", ""Y. Cant\u00f3n"", ""A. Sol\u00e9-Benet"", ""J. Bevan"", ""R. Alexander"", ""L.G. Sancho"", ""J. Puigdef\u00e1bregas""]"	Badlands often contain a mosaic of soil surface types with contrasting hydrological behaviour which drives their short term geomorphic evolution. The Tabernas badlands, in semiarid SE Spain, show a complex mosaic of bare ground, biological soil crusts and plant covered patches, and high variability of covers and morphologies. Previous work has identified the surfaces that act as sources of runoff and sediments and those that act as sinks; the pathways of runoff between surfaces, and the runoff and erosion at catchment scale. However, surfaces without vascular plants, can be quite dynamic, with important effects on geomorphic processes. This work aims to generate hypotheses about the dynamics of both bare soil (34% of the area) and biological soil crusts (33%), and to provide a first estimation of the growth rate of terricolous lichens (as increase of coverage) and their geomorphological implications. The dynamics of ten representative soil surfaces were photographically monitored over 13 years, recording the cover and pattern of bare soil and of the two main kinds of biological soil crust: Ôbrown crustÕ and Ôwhite crustÕ. Erosion/deposition were measured by erosion pins in unbounded plots, and the hydrological and erosional behaviour monitored in bounded plots under natural and simulated rainfall. Biological colonization and crust growth were studied from 2004 within cleared plots in four crust communities. Microclimate was continuously monitored in each community. After 13 years, net erosion was recorded only in previously eroded slopes and divides. Vegetated sites and those covered by biological soil crust remained more or less invariant or recorded sedimentation. In all white crust surfaces, whole crust cover increased by 3% on average, while macrolichen cover increased by nearly 30%. Within the driest brown crust, macrolichen cover increased by 7%, while the whole crust decreased by 3%. According to previous work, lichen cover, particularly of white crust, is often greater in north to east facing orientations because of the higher slope stability and the longer duration of moisture. However, the increase of the whole biological soil crust can depend more on species composition and previous cover and less or not at all on the aspect, although certain species do grow faster in particular orientations. Within the plots cleared in 2004 the greatest increase occurred in the pioneering brown crust, which reached an average of 26% cover after one year, in spite of it receiving the most insolation. Significant microclimatic differences exist among the communities, mainly in radiation, soil moisture and thallus surface temperature. Terricolous lichen crusts, primary colonizers of bare, sufficiently stable areas, can grow quickly and, by increasing soil stability and development and modifying surface hydrology, they can influence surface dynamics and ultimately landform dynamics. Crust growth rate probably decreases as its cover increases and it probably also oscillates with microclimatic oscillations. However, the high potential growth rate recorded allows detection not only of climatic changes but also short term (possibly seasonal) periods of stability. Extensive lichen crusts indicate low erosion rates and particular climatic conditions; variations of crust cover could indicate climatic (or land use) variations.	The influence of photobiont selection on the ecological amplitude of lichens is still largely underexplored (Peksa and Skaloud 2011) and shedding more light on this phenomenon would help towards understanding structure, composition and development of BCSs (Bowker 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2008).

CC1451	54847651	Intuitive and Reflective Responses in Philosophy	Nick Byrd	The magical number two, plus or minus: Dual-process theory as a theory of cognitive kinds	"[""Richard Samuels""]"	This chapter considers the question of whether there is some general, distinctive, and plausible dual-process thesis about cognition. It argues that there is such an account, called the type version of dual-process theory. The first section identifies a substantive and interesting class of hypotheses worthy of the 'dual-process' label and contrasts them with some other, rather more banal claims. The second section distinguishes between two quite different versions of the hypothesis: one on which dual-process theory is construed as a thesis about cognitive tokens, the other on which it is a thesis about cognitive types. The third section sketches the reasons for rejecting the cognitive tokens version of dual-process theory. The fourth section highlights the virtues of the cognitive types version. The last section concludes that given a clear understanding of the cognitive types proposal, one can deflect the main general objections to dual-process theorizing.

Griffin"", ""Nicholas J. Wareham"", "" ""]"	OBJECTIVE We sought to examine the independent associations between different dimensions of physical activity with intermediary and clustered metabolic risk factors in overweight individuals with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes to inform future preventive action.   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We measured total body movement and five other subcomponents of physical activity by accelerometry in 258 adults (aged 30-50 years) with a family history of type 2 diabetes. We estimated aerobic fitness from an incremental treadmill exercise test. We measured body composition by bioimpedance and waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, glucose, and insulin with standard methods. We constructed a standardized continuously distributed variable for clustered risk.   RESULTS Total body movement (counts . day(-1)) was significantly and independently associated with three of six risk factors (fasting triglycerides, insulin, and HDL) and with clustered metabolic risk (P = 0.004) after adjustment for age, sex, and obesity. Time spent at moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity (MPVA) was independently associated with clustered metabolic risk (P = 0.03). Five- and 10-min bouts of MVPA, time spent sedentary, time spent at light-intensity activity, and aerobic fitness were not significantly related with clustered risk after adjustment for confounding factors.   CONCLUSIONS Total body movement is associated with intermediary phenotypic risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic disease and with clustered metabolic risk independent of aerobic fitness and obesity.

To this end, this research aimed at investigating the use of Bayesian networks for predicting performance of a student, based on values of some identified attributes. We presented empirical experiments on the prediction of performance with a data set of high school students containing 8 attributes. The paper demonstrates an application of the Bayesian approach in the field of education and shows that the Bayesian network classifier has a potential to be used as a tool for prediction of student performance	If this assumption is invalid, conditional probabilities between attributes can be modelled as a Bayesian Network (#AUTHOR_TAG & Menzel, 2005).

CC1331	93144659	A Review of Psychometric Data Analysis and Applications	Geraldine Gray	The pulse of learning analytics understandings and expectations from the stakeholders	"[""Hendrik Drachsler"", ""Wolfgang Greller""]"	While there is currently much buzz about the new field of learning analytics [19] and the potential it holds for benefiting teaching and learning, the impression one currently gets is that there is also much uncertainty and hesitation, even extending to scepticism. A clear common understanding and vision for the domain has not yet formed among the educator and research community. To investigate this situation, we distributed a stakeholder survey in September 2011 to an international audience from different sectors of education. The findings provide some further insights into the current level of understanding and expectations toward learning analytics among stakeholders. The survey was scaffolded by a conceptual framework on learning analytics that was developed based on a recent literature review. It divides the domain of learning analytics into six critical dimensions. The preliminary survey among 156 educational practitioners and researchers mostly from the higher education sector reveals substantial uncertainties in learning analytics.  In this article, we first briefly introduce the learning analytics framework and its six domains that formed the backbone structure to our survey. Afterwards, we describe the method and key results of the learning analytics questionnaire and draw further conclusions for the field in research and practice. The article finishes with plans for future research on the questionnaire and the publication of both data and the questions for others to utilize.

CC2980	82867364	Wandering tales: evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language	Michael Corballis	The Evolution of Language	"[""Michael C. Corballis""]"	Language, whether spoken or signed, can be viewed as a gestural system, evolving from the so-called mirror system in the primate brain. In nonhuman primates the gestural system is well developed for the productions and perception of manual action, especially transitive acts involving the grasping of objects. The emergence of bipedalism in the hominins freed the hands for the adaptation of the mirror system for intransitive acts for communication, initially through the miming of events. With the emergence of the genus Homo from some 2 million years ago, pressures for more complex communication and increased vocabulary size led to the conventionalization of gestures, the loss of iconic representation, and a gradual shift to vocal gestures replacing manual ones--although signed languages are still composed of manual and facial gestures. In parallel with the conventionalization of symbols, languages gained grammatical complexity, perhaps driven by the evolution of episodic memory and mental time travel, which involve combinations of familiar elements--Who did what to whom, when, where, and why? Language is thus adapted to allow us to share episodic structures, whether past, planned, or fictional, and so increase survival fitness.	Indeed, language itself may have evolved precisely to allow communication about the non-present (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2009;G�_rdenfors and Osvath, 2010), so we can share our mental travels to other places and other times.

In this paper, I study numerically the fluctuation spectra around a Gaussian classical solution of a tensor model, which represents a fuzzy flat space in arbitrary dimensions. It is found that the momentum distribution of the low-lying low-momentum spectra is in agreement with that of the metric tensor modulo the general coordinate transformation in the general relativity at least in the dimensions studied numerically, i.e. one to four dimensions.

Random permutation ensures that the data has the same distributions as the data it is based on, but that the variables are now independent.It is shown that both of the real HoNOS data sets are significantly different to the independent items data in many ways. An examination of fit statistics from confirmatory factor analysis is also used to show that the independence model is a very poor fit to the data.It is clear that the 12 HoNOS scales are unlikely to be independent.

This study examined the ability of both alcohol-attentional bias and motivational structure to predict alcohol consumption. Participants were university students (N=87) who completed a battery of tests, including the Personal Concerns Inventory (a measure of adaptive and maladaptive motivation), an alcohol Stroop test (a measure of alcohol-attentional bias), and an alcohol-use inventory. Regression, moderation, and mediation analyses showed that (a) maladaptive motivation and alcohol-attentional bias were positive predictors of alcohol consumption after participants' age, gender, and executive cognitive functioning had been controlled, and (b) maladaptive motivation and alcohol-attentional bias independently predicted alcohol consumption. The implications of the results for both theory and practice are discussed.

"[""Philippe C. Baveye"", ""David Rangel"", ""Astrid R. Jacobson"", ""Magdeline Laba"", ""Christophe Darnault"", ""Wilfred Otten"", ""Ricardo Radulovich"", ""Flavio A. O. Camargo""]"	"Since the late 1970s, thousands of scholarly articles, books and reports have dealt with the application of the mathematical theory of geostatistics to characterize the spatial ""variability"" of soils, and to produce soil property maps. Insensibly, this application of geostatistics appears to have become an end in itself, and the reasons why one should be concerned about the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties are rarely if ever made clear any more. In this context, the purpose of the present critical review article is to return to some of the primal questions that motivated this interest in the topic several decades ago. After a brief review of the background behind the application of geostatistics to soils, a number of situations and modeling efforts are described where, even though soils undoubtedly vary spatially, nothing seems to be gained practically by explicitly accounting for their spatial heterogeneity in order to reach a number of management or research objectives. Contrastedly, whenever the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties in the field might be relevant, it is shown that very different perceptions about it emerge, depending on the type of measurement that is performed. This suggests that the approach one adopts to characterize spatially-varying soil properties should be dictated by whatever goal one pursues. For example, if the objective is to evaluate the ""ecosystem services"" of soils in a given region and to reach decisions about them, one should probably first consider the (typically large) spatial scale that is most relevant to the decision-making process, then proceed via a top-down approach to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of soil services, if and when appropriate. In other contexts, it is argued that measurements should be patterned after the behavior of plants or microbes present in soils, relative to which, unfortunately, the macroscopic measurements that are now routinely carried out appear largely irrelevant or misleading.

An increasingly accepted explanation of the lack of progress regarding the processes that control the fate of carbon in soils is that traditional macroscopic measurements (e.g., of organic matter content, microbial population density, or genetic diversity) are unable to capture, even qualitatively, the key features of microbial activity in soils, and that crucial aspects of the intricate conformation of microbial micro-environments at sub-macroscopic scales are being missed (Baveye et al., 2011;#AUTHOR_TAG and Laba, 2014).

Among the various bioactive compounds, biosurfactant (BS)/bioemulsifiers (BE) are attracting major interest and attention due to their structural and functional diversity. The versatile properties of surface active molecules find numerous applications in various industries. Marine microorganisms such as Acinetobacter, Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas, Halomonas, Myroides, Corynebacteria, Bacillus, Alteromonas sp. have been studied for production of BS/BE and exopolysaccharides (EPS). Due to the enormity of marine biosphere, most of the marine microbial world remains unexplored. The discovery of potent BS/BE producing marine microorganism would enhance the use of environmental biodegradable surface active molecule and hopefully reduce total dependence or number of new application oriented towards the chemical synthetic surfactant industry. Our present review gives comprehensive information on BS/BE which has been reported to be produced by marine microorganisms and their possible potential future applications.

Depending on the energy sources used to produce the hydrogen they may also reduce greenhouse gases in the long-term. Besides problems related to the necessary investments into hydrogen infrastructure, there is a general notion that current fuel cells costs are too high to be competitive with conventional engines, creating an insurmountable barrier to introduction. But given historical evidence from many other technologies it is highly likely that learning by doing (LBD) would lead to substantial cost reductions. In this study we implement potential cost reductions from LBD into an existing agent based model that captures the main dynamics of the introduction of the new technology together with hydrogen infrastructure build up. Assumptions about the learning rate turn out to have a critical impact on the projected diffusion of the FCVs. Moreover, LBD could imply a substantial first mover advantage. We also address the impact of learning spillovers between producers and find that a government might face a policy trade off between fostering diffusion by facilitating learning spillovers and protecting the relative advantage of a national technological leader.

Cole""]"	The multitraitÐmultimethod ({mtmm}) design is often used in test validation research to disentangle problems due to shared method variance. However, {mtmm} research requires extensive data collection that may be prohibitive in clinical settings. Furthermore, interpretation of {mtmm} data can be ambiguous and misleading. In the current article, maximum-likelihood confirmatory factor analysis ({cfa}) is presented as a means for less ambiguous interpretation of complete and incomplete {mtmm} designs. Confirmatory Factor analysis is applied to four data sets that represent four designs: monotraitÐmonomethod, multitraitÐmonomethod, monotraitÐmultimethod, and multitraitÐmultimethod. In all four cases, {cfa} results provided more rigorous support of the original authors' positions and provided valuable supplemental findings as well. Additionally, {cfa} was applied to an artificial data set. Intuitive interpretations of the artificial data were compared with the results of the {cfa}. The results showed that the intuitive approach can lead to highly spurious conclusions regarding convergent and discriminant validity.

To develop a reliable and valid self-report scale which (1) will assess the distress and difficulties experienced in living with a problem of appearance; (2) can be used with clinical and non-clinical populations; and (3) facilitates clinical decisionmaking and research through good standardization, sensitivity and discrimination. Design.Cross-sectional survey designs using clinical and non-clinical populations and a pre-post intervention design using plastic surgery patients. Method. A large initial item set was refined through a controlled pre-post surgery study and a cross-sectional study of a plastic surgery waiting list (606). The resulting 59-item scale was administered to 1740 patients with problems of appearance and to a representative general population sample (1001). Results. Principal component and factor analyses identified a stable five-factor structure accounting for 63.5% of the variance, with a primary factor of self-consciousness of appearance. Internal consistency was high (alpha= .98) and test-retest reliabilities (three months) were good (.75 (general population); .86 (patients)). Correlations with existing tests showed appropriate criterion validity (.74-.62). Good construct validity was evidenced in pre- and post-operative changes, in differences between patients and controls and in convergent and divergent correlation patterns. The general population data reveal widespread concerns about appearance. Conclusions. The DAS-59 provides a widely acceptable, psychometrically robust, factorial self-report scale to assess distress and dysfunction in problems of appearance across the full range of 'visibility' and aetiologies. It is sensitive to therapeutic change and discriminates well between patient groups.

Thomas Vanoutrive	Introducing a commute-energy performance index for Flanders	"[""Kobe Boussauw"", ""Frank Witlox""]"	Based on 2001-census data for Belgium, energy consumption levels for commuting were calculated and mapped on the basis of residential locations in the administrative regions of Flanders and Brussels. Comparison with regional differentiations in commuting distances, modal shares of non-car travel modes and aspects of infrastructure and population densities clarifies some relationships between energy consumption, commuting behaviour and spatial-economic structure in the suburbanised historic-polycentric spatial structure which characterises the northern part of Belgium. It is found that mode choice appears to be of little impact for the energy performance of home-to-work travel on the scale of the Flanders region. At the other hand, proximity between home and work locations is paramount.  Residential density plays a part in this, although much depends on the specific situation. This is also the case for the accessibility of the main road and rail network. In some regions these infrastructures induce long-distance commuting, whereas in the economic core areas this effect is much less pronounced. All these are factors that are very much determined by infrastructural and spatial policies of the past	These are the areas with lower average commuting distances (#AUTHOR_TAG and Witlox, 2009).

In the model two adjacent cells are randomly selected, then chemical reactions are carried out in the two selected cells. The properties (mass and heat) of the two cells are then transferred. The operating parameters of the model are the frequency for pair sampling, and a partition parameter that defines the fraction of property to be transferred. The partition parameter was shown to assume the role of the transport coefficient. The model was shown to precisely simulate molecular diffusion accompanied with chemical reactions. The method was illustrated by oxidation and ignition of char in order to illustrate its usefulness in simulating steady and unsteady problems. In the present example, the bulk gas temperature was assumed 300 K and only heterogeneous oxidation was considered. Both time-dependent and steady-state solutions are given.

The use of glycosyl hydrolases from marine environments dates back to the end of the 1960s and was mainly focused on the development of sensitive and reliable hydrolytic methods for the analysis of sugar chains. As a result not all the benefits of a particular enzymatic activity have been investigated, especially regarding the transglycosylation potential of these enzymes for the synthesis of glycosidic bonds. In this review, the potential of marine sources will be demonstrated reporting on the few examples found in literature for the synthesis and hydrolysis of biologically relevant oligosaccharides catalyzed by glycosyl hydrolases of marine origin. Particular emphasis is given to the synthesis of glycosidic bonds, which is easy by the use of glycosyl hydrolases.

CC1802	30730382	Beyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific Explanation	Richard Cooper	How Can the Human Mind Occur in the Physical Universe?	"[""John R. Anderson""]"	Humans share the same basic cognitive architecture with all primates, but they have evolved abilities to exercise abstract control over cognition and to process more complex relational patterns. The human cognitive architecture consists of a set of largely independent modules associated with different brain regions. In this book John Anderson discusses in detail how these various modules can combine to produce behaviors as varied as driving a car and solving an algebraic equation, but focuses principally on two of the modules: the declarative and the procedural. The declarative module involves a memory system that, moment by moment, attempts to give each person the most appropriate possible window into his or her past. The procedural module involves a central system that strives to develop a set of productions that will enable the most adaptive response from any state of the modules. In addressing the question of how the mind exists in the physical universe, Anderson organizes his answer around the ACT-R architecture, but broadens it by bringing in research from all areas of cognitive science, including how recent work in brain imaging maps onto the cognitive architecture.	A similar approach to bridging CL and ARL theories also does so by memory retrieval mechanisms based on relevance to the current context (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007;Lebiere et al., 2013;.

The rods of diurnal retinas possess the conventional architecture found in nearly all eukaryotic cells, with most heterochromatin situated at the nuclear periphery and euchromatin residing toward the nuclear interior. The rods of nocturnal retinas have a unique inverted pattern, where heterochromatin localizes in the nuclear center, whereas euchromatin, as well as nascent transcripts and splicing machinery, line the nuclear border. The inverted pattern forms by remodeling of the conventional one during terminal differentiation of rods. The inverted rod nuclei act as collecting lenses, and computer simulations indicate that columns of such nuclei channel light efficiently toward the light-sensing rod outer segments. Comparison of the two patterns suggests that the conventional architecture prevails in eukaryotic nuclei because it results in more flexible chromosome arrangements, facilitating positional regulation of nuclear functions.

This method capitalizes on the absence of confounding factors that typically affect the study of hallucinations in clinical subjects.To estimate the prevalence of HLEs in young adults; validate the mutidimensionality and explore the correlates of latent HLEs clusters.Cross-sectional survey design. The extended 16-item Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale (LSHS-E) and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) were administered to 649 Italian college students (males: 47%). Confirmatory factorial analysis was used to test multidimensionality of the LSHS-E. Hierarchical nested, progressively constrained models were used to assess configural, metric and scalar invariance of the LSHS-E. Latent class analysis was used to test the existence of different profiles of responding across the identified hallucination-proneness dimensions.Factor analysis showed that the four-factor model had the best fit. Factors were invariant across demographic variables and levels of psychological distress. Three latent classes were found: a large class with no HLEs (70% of participants), a multisensory HLEs class (18.8%), and a high hallucination-proneness class (11%). Among those reporting high levels of HLEs, approximately half reported scores indicative of considerable psychological distress.Although HLEs have a relatively high prevalence in the general population, the majority of those experiences happen in isolation and are not associated to psychological distress. Approximately half of those individuals experiencing high levels of HLEs report significant psychological distress. This may be indicative of general risk for mental health conditions rather than specific risk for psychosis.Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

CC1370	30706837	Safe Concurrency Introduction through Slicing	Huiqing Li	Dynamic slicing of parallel message-passing programs	"[""M. Kamkar"", ""P. Krajina"", ""P. Fritzson""]"	As software applications grow larger and more complex, program maintenance activities such as adding new functionality, debugging and testing consume an increasing amount of available resources for software development. This is especially true for distributed systems communicating via message-passing. In order to cope with this increased complexity, programmers need effective computer-supported methods for decomposition and dependence analysis of programs, to understand dependencies between different parts of software systems and to find the sources of errors. Program slicing is one method for such decomposition and dependence analysis. A program slice with respect to a specified variable at some program point consists of those parts of the program which may directly or indirectly affect the value of that variable at the particular program point. In this paper, we present an algorithm for dynamic slicing of distributed/parallel programs and some results from an implementation for a parallel MIMD computer.

Murray"", ""A.G. Wintle""]"	"Abstract This paper examines the effects of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) components, other than that usually termed the fast component, on dose determination by the single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) protocol. Results are presented for ""dose recovery tests"", in which a known laboratory dose, delivered after optical bleaching at room temperature, is measured using the SAR protocol. Data obtained using either the initial OSL signal or the fast component, derived by curve fitting, are compared. Dose recovery tests are also carried out when an additional step is added to the SAR protocol, aimed at reducing recuperation, i.e. the residual signal observed in a SAR cycle when no regenerative dose is applied. The results for quartz from various sources indicate much improved dose recovery when only a well-separated fast component is analysed."	The development of single aliquot regeneration (SAR) protocols provides improved accuracy and precision for dating the burial time of eolian quartz grains (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG and Wintle, 2003;Wintle and Murray, 2006) and needed resolution for dating young sediments, <500 years old (Madsen and Murray, 2009).

Contrary to classical systems, Deep Learning models can learn the representation of the data automatically without an expert domain knowledge and avoid the tedious and time-consuming task of defining relevant features.  A Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI), which is an essential subset of Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR),  represents the alterations in the effects of drugs that were taken simultaneously. The early  recognition of interacting drugs is a vital process that prevents serious health problems that can  cause death in the worst cases. Health-care professionals and researchers in this domain find the  task of discovering information about these incidents very challenging due to the vast number  of pharmacovigilance documents. For this reason, several shared tasks and datasets have been  developed in order to solve this issue with automated annotation systems with the capability  to extract this information. In the present document, the DDI corpus, which is an annotated  dataset of DDIs, is used with Deep Learning architectures without any external information  for the tasks of Name Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction in order to validate the  hypothesis. Furthermore, some other datasets are tested to evidence the performance of these  systems.  To sum up, the results suggest that the most common Deep Learning methods like Convolutional  Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks overcome the traditional algorithms  concluding that Deep Learning is a real alternative for a specific and complex scenario like the  Information Extraction in the Biomedical domain. As a final goal, a complete architecture that  covers the two tasks is developed to structure the named entities and their relationships from  raw pharmacological texts.This thesis has been supported by:  Pre-doctoral research training scholarship of the Carlos III University of Madrid (PIF UC3M 02-1415) for four years.

Repetitions are highly periodic factors (substrings) in strings and are related to periodicities, regularities, and compression. The repetitive structure of strings leads to higher compression rates, and conversely, some compression techniques are at the core of fast algorithms for detecting repetitions. There are several types of repetitions in strings: squares, cubes, and maximal repetitions also called runs. For these repetitions, we distinguish between the factors (sometimes qualified as distinct) and their occurrences (also called positioned factors). The combinatorics of repetitions is a very intricate area, full of open problems. For example we know that the number of (distinct) primitively-rooted squares in a string of length n is no more than [email protected](logn), conjecture to be n, and that their number of occurrences can be @Q(nlogn). Similarly we know that there are at most 1.029n and at least 0.944n maximal repetitions and the conjecture is again that the exact bound is n. We know almost everything about the repetitions in Sturmian words, but despite the simplicity of these words, the results are nontrivial. One of the main motivations for writing this text is the development during the last couple of years of new techniques and results about repetitions. We report both the progress which has been achieved and which we expect to happen.	The notion of periodicity in words and its many variants have been well-studied in numerous fields like combinatorics on words, pattern matching, data compression, automata theory, formal language theory, and molecular biology (see #AUTHOR_TAG).

Although influenza virus infection alone can result in pneumonia, secondary bacterial infection combined with the virus is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Interestingly, while influenza infection increases susceptibility to some bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Haemophilus influenzae, other bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae are not associated with influenza infection. The reason for this discrepancy is not known. In this study, it was found that prior influenza virus infection inhibits murine alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of S. aureus but not of E. coli. Here, the mechanism for this inhibition is elucidated: prior influenza virus infection strongly increases interferon gamma (IFN-g) production. Furthermore, it was shown that IFN-g differentially affects alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of S. aureus and E. coli. The findings of the present study explain how influenza virus infection increases susceptibility to some bacteria, such as S. aureus, but not others, and provides evidence that IFN-g might be a promising target for protecting the human population from secondary bacterial infection by influenza.(c) 2011 The Societies and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

Burr""]"	SummarySeveral studies have shown that adults integrate visual and haptic information (and information from other modalities) in a statistically optimal fashion, weighting each sense according to its reliability [1, 2]. When does this capacity for crossmodal integration develop? Here, we show that prior to 8 years of age, integration of visual and haptic spatial information is far from optimal, with either vision or touch dominating totally, even in conditions in which the dominant sense is far less precise than the other (assessed by discrimination thresholds). For size discrimination, haptic information dominates in determining both perceived size and discrimination thresholds, whereas for orientation discrimination, vision dominates. By 8-10 years, the integration becomes statistically optimal, like adults. We suggest that during development, perceptual systems require constant recalibration, for which cross-sensory comparison is important. Using one sense to calibrate the other precludes useful combination of the two sources	These tasks have found absent or suboptimal pooling of signals until much later in childhood (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008;Nardini et al., 2008;Nardini et al., 2010;Gori et al., 2012;Nardini et al., 2013;Petrini et al., 2014).

In contrast with the standard notion of a rational-expectations equilibrium, we model consumers as boundedly rational and unable either to pay immediate attention to each price change or to make accurate forecasts of the adoption of the network good. Our analysis shows that the seller's optimal price trajectory has the following structure: The price is low when the user base is below a target level, is high when the user base is above the target, and is set to keep the user base stationary once the target level has been attained. We show that this pricing policy is robust to a number of extensions, which include the product's user base evolving over time and consumers basing their choices on a mixture of a myopic and a ""stubborn"" expectation of adoption. Our results differ significantly from those that would be predicted by a model based on rational-expectations equilibrium and are more consistent with the pricing of network goods observed in practice."	#AUTHOR_TAG and Sundararajan (2006) allow for a mixture of forward looking and boundedly rational consumers.

"[""Edward Glaeser"", ""Rafael La Porta"", ""Florencio Lopez-de-Silane"", ""Andrei Shleifer""]"	We revisit the debate over whether political institutions cause economic growth, or whether, alternatively, growth and human capital accumulation lead to institutional improvement. We find that most indicators of institutional quality used to establish the proposition that institutions cause growth are constructed to be conceptually unsuitable for that purpose. We also find that some of the instrumental variable techniques used in the literature are flawed. Basic OLS results, as well as a variety of additional evidence, suggest that a) human capital is a more basic source of growth than are the institutions, b) poor countries get out of poverty through good policies, often pursued by dictators, and c) subsequently improve their political institutions.

CC312	206252006	The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	Simon Dietz	Ambiguity and Climate Policy	"[""Antony Millner"", ""Simon Dietz"", ""Geoffrey Heal""]"	Economic evaluation of climate policy traditionally treats uncertainty by appealing to expected utility theory. Yet our knowledge of the impacts of climate policy may not be of sufficient quality to justify probabilistic beliefs. In such circumstances, it has been argued that the axioms of expected utility theory may not be the correct standard of rationality. By contrast, several axiomatic frameworks have recently been proposed that account for ambiguous beliefs. In this paper, we apply static and dynamic versions of a smooth ambiguity model to climate mitigation policy. We obtain a general result on the comparative statics of optimal abatement and ambiguity aversion and illustrate this sufficient condition in some simple examples. We then extend our analysis to a more realistic, dynamic setting, and adapt a well-known empirical model of the climate-economy system to show that the value of emissions abatement increases as ambiguity aversion increases, and that this 'ambiguity premium' can in some plausible cases be very large	In the present context, this means that the decision-maker focuses more on models yielding higher estimates of the SCC (see also #AUTHOR_TAG, Dietz and Heal 2010).

CC2216	81800077	Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	Fabio Reale	A new interpretation of the redshift observed in optically thin transition region lines	"[""Viggo Hansteen""]"	It is proposed that the pervasive redshift observed in transition region spectral lines is caused by downward propagating acoustic waves. The dynamic response of a coronal loop to energy released as heat near the loop apex is examined by solving the hydrodynamic equations numerically, consistently including the effects of nonequilibrium ionization on the radiative losses and on the internal energy. It is found that the radiative loss curve may change by a factor of 2 during the loop evolution as a result of flows and waves. A simple analytical analysis is performed to isolate the physical effects relevant to the line formation process. The amplitude of the line shift is found to depend on the characteristic time scale for ionization of the radiating ion as well as the global loop parameters, the time scales for loop cooling, the maximum temperature, and the base pressure.	Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain these redshifts: downward propagating acoustic waves (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1993), downdrafts driven by radiativelycooling condensations in the solar transition region (Reale et al., 1996(Reale et al., , 1997b, nanoflares (Teriaca et al., 1999); the scenario is improving with the better and better definition of the observational framework.

The major post-Golgi compartments are numerous and appear to be similar to their counterparts in animals. However, endosomes are rather ill defined morphologically but seem to be involved in specific trafficking pathways. Many plasma-membrane proteins cycle constitutively via endosomal compartments. The trans-Golgi network (TGN) appears to be an early endosome where secretory and endocytic traffic meet. Endocytosed proteins that are to be degraded are targeted to the vacuole via the multivesiculate prevacuolar compartment (PVC) whereas cycling proteins pass through recycling endosomes. The trafficking machinery involves the same classes of proteins as in other eukaryotes. However, there are modifications that match the specifics of post-Golgi traffic in plants. Although plants lack epithelia, some plasma-membrane proteins are located on specific faces of the cell which reflects polarized traffic and influences the physiological performance of the tissue. Plants also differentiate highly polarized tip-growing cells in which post-Golgi traffic is adapted to very high rates of targeted exocytosis, endocytosis and recycling.	A plant characteristic i-SNARE activity could be determinant on vacuoles or post-Golgi endocytic compartments since these compartments appear to diversify between plants and non-plant organisms (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009).

CC922	81846122	Isotopic analysis of cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation associated with subarctic lichen and bryophyte species	Konstantin Gavazov	Effects of enhanced UV-B radiation on nitrogen fixation in arctic ecosystems	"[""B Solheim"", ""M Zielke"", ""J W Bjerke"", ""J Rozema""]"	Recent global climate models predict a further significant loss of ozone in the next decades, with up to 50% depletion of the ozone layer over large parts of the Arctic resulting in an increase in ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) (280-315 nm) reaching the surface of the Earth. The percentage of total annual ecosystem N input due to biological nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria might be as high as 80% and the contribution to total annual N uptake by plants up to 20%. A possible reduction of nitrogen fixation raises serious concerns about already nutrient impoverished plant communities. This review shows that nitrogen fixation by moss-associated cyanobacteria in arctic vegetation was dramatically reduced after six years of exposure to enhanced UV-B radiation. In subarctic vegetation, nitrogen fixation activity of moss-associated cyanobacteria was not affected by 6 years of enhanced UV-B radiation. However, a 50% increase of summer precipitation resulted in a 5- to 6-fold increase in activity. Long-term effects of UV-B radiation on nitrogen fixation activity have been examined only in two lichens, giving contrasting results. Peltigera aphthosa (L.) Willd., having external cephalodia, experienced a significant reduction, whereas Peltigera didactyla (With.) J.R. Laudon, having cyanobacteria in the photobiont layer below the upper cortex, did not experience any changes due to radiation regimes. The difference is probably related to the location of the cyanobacteria. While the Nostoc cells are protected by the fungal, melanized upper cortex in P. didactyla, they are exposed and unprotected in P. aphthosa, and their own synthesis of UV-B absorbing compounds appears to be low. Under certain environmental conditions, an increasing UV-B radiation will dramatically affect nitrogen fixation in arctic tundra vegetation, which in turn may have severe influence on the nitrogen budget in these environments. Further long-term studies are necessary to conclude if these effects are temporal and how concurrent climatic changes will influence the nitrogen balance of the ecosystem.

A Systematic Review of the Qualitative Evidence	Andrea Smith	Adherence to and Reasons for Premature Discontinuation From Stop-Smoking Medications: Data From the ITC Four-Country Survey	"[""J. Balmford"", ""R. Borland"", ""D. Hammond"", ""K. M. Cummings""]"	Nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) have been demonstrated to be effective in clinical trials but may have lower efficacy when purchased over-the-counter (OTC). Premature discontinuation and insufficient dosing have been offered as possible explanations. The aims are to (a) investigate the prevalence of and reasons for premature discontinuation of stop-smoking medications (including prescription only) and (b) how these differ by type, duration of use, and source (prescription or OTC).The sample includes 1,219 smokers or recent quitters who had used medication in the last year (80.5% NRT, 19.5% prescription only). Data were from Waves 5 and 6 of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four-Country Survey.Most of the sample (69.1%) discontinued medication use prematurely. This was more common among NRT users (71.4%) than in users of bupropion and varenicline (59.6%). OTC NRT users were particularly likely to discontinue (76.3%). Relapse back to smoking was the most common reason for discontinuation of medication reported by 41.6% of respondents. Side effects (18.3%) and believing that the medication was no longer needed (17.1%) were also commonly reported. Of those who completed treatment, 37.9% achieved 6-month continuous abstinence compared with 15.6% who discontinued prematurely. Notably, 65.6% who discontinued because they believed the medication had worked were abstinent.Premature discontinuation of stop-smoking medications is common but is not a plausible reason for poorer quit outcomes for most people. Encouraging persistence of medication use after relapse or in the face of minor side effects may help increase long-term cessation outcomes.	#AUTHOR_TAG Further complicating the relationship, some regard commitment as a component of motivation, [57] operationalizing motivation as, for example, 'determination to quit' [58] or 'commitment to quit'.

Bouchard"", ""Nima Mesgarani"", ""Keith Johnson"", ""Edward F. Chang""]"	Speaking is one of the most complex actions that we perform, but nearly all of us learn to do it effortlessly. Production of fluent speech requires the precise, coordinated movement of multiple articulators (for example, the lips, jaw, tongue and larynx) over rapid time scales. Here we used high-resolution, multi-electrode cortical recordings during the production of consonant-vowel syllables to determine the organization of speech sensorimotor cortex in humans. We found speech-articulator representations that are arranged somatotopically on ventral pre- and post-central gyri, and that partially overlap at individual electrodes. These representations were coordinated temporally as sequences during syllable production. Spatial patterns of cortical activity showed an emergent, population-level representation, which was organized by phonetic features. Over tens of milliseconds, the spatial patterns transitioned between distinct representations for different consonants and vowels. These results reveal the dynamic organization of speech sensorimotor cortex during the generation of multi-articulator movements that underlies our ability to speak	"In a recent analysis of the neural mechanisms of speech articulation, #AUTHOR_TAG et al.

The primary manifestation of this property has been the difficulty in translating the information derived from reductionist, basic science research into effective clinical treatment regimens for sepsis. However, the recognition of the ""complexity"" of the AIR is not without its pitfalls. Despite its limitations, reductionism remains the primary means of obtaining scientific information. Furthermore, a functional shortcoming of use of the term complex has been to make it equivalent to ""essentially unsolvable."" Therefore, a mechanism is needed to integrate the apparatus of reductionist analysis into a complex synthetic methodology that overcomes the current limitations of both. Toward this end, I propose a structure for a class of collaborative, community-wide in silico models that use the framework of agent-based modeling. Agent-based modeling is a type of mathematical modeling that focuses on the behaviors of the components of complex systems and is well suited for translating the results of basic science experiments. I will also introduce a preliminary version of a syntactical ""grammar"" that can potentially be used to facilitate the transfer of basic science data into computer code. It is hoped that when a mature version of this framework is implemented, the resulting models will provide a functional, synthetic data base on the AIR that could be used for directing research, testing hypotheses, teaching and training, and drug discovery/testing."

Lycett"", ""Liliane Sticher"", ""Francesca Sbano"", ""Marianna Faraco"", ""Giuseppe Dalessandro"", ""Gian-Pietro Di Sansebastiano""]"	The regulatory functions of Rab proteins in membrane trafficking lie in their ability to perform as molecular switches that oscillate between a GTP- and a GDP-bound conformation. The role of tomato LeRab11a in secretion was analyzed in tobacco protoplasts. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)/red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged LeRab11a was localized at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in vivo. Two serines in the GTP-binding site of the protein were mutagenized, giving rise to the three mutants Rab11S22N, Rab11S27N and Rab11S22/27N. The double mutation reduced secretion of a marker protein, secRGUS (secreted rat beta-glucuronidase), by half, whereas each of the single mutations alone had a much smaller effect, showing that both serines have to be mutated to obtain a dominant negative effect on LeRab11a function. The dominant negative mutant was used to determine whether Rab11 is involved in the pathway(s) regulated by the plasma membrane syntaxins SYP121 and SYP122. Co-expression of either of these GFP-tagged syntaxins with the dominant negative Rab11S22/27N mutant led to the appearance of endosomes, but co-expression of GFP-tagged SYP122 also labeled the endoplasmic reticulum and dotted structures. However, co-expression of Rab11S22/27N with SYP121 dominant negative mutants decreased secretion of secRGUS further compared with the expression of Rab11S22/27N alone, whereas co-expression of Rab11S22/27N with SYP122 had no synergistic effect. With the same essay, the difference between SYP121- and SYP122-dependent secretion was then evidenced. The results suggest that Rab11 regulates anterograde transport from the TGN to the plasma membrane and strongly implicate SYP122, rather than SYP121. The differential effect of LeRab11a supports the possibility that SYP121 and SYP122 drive independent secretory events.

Glass"", ""Nina Alperovich"", ""Rembert Pieper"", ""Prashanth P. Parmar"", ""Clyde A. Hutchison"", ""Hamilton O. Smith"", ""J. Craig Venter""]"	As a step toward propagation of synthetic genomes, we completely replaced the genome of a bacterial cell with one from another species by transplanting a whole genome as naked DNA. Intact genomic DNA from Mycoplasma mycoides large colony (LC), virtually free of protein, was transplanted into Mycoplasma capricolum cells by polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation. Cells selected for tetracycline resistance, carried by the M. mycoides LC chromosome, contain the complete donor genome and are free of detectable recipient genomic sequences. These cells that result from genome transplantation are phenotypically identical to the M. mycoides LC donor strain as judged by several criteria.	Beside experiments showing that pieces of program can be handled by cells (viruses and horizontal gene transfer), experiments produce results consistent with the model: 1. Animal cloning (Wilmut et al. 1997) is now commonplace; 2. The genome of a Mycoplasma species M. mycoides, was transplanted into another species, M. capricolum, and after several rounds of reproduction (reproduction of the machine and replication of the program, see below) the host species was replaced by a colony of the donor genome (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2007).

Raab (1962) suggested an account of this redundant-targets effect in terms of a race model in which the response to redundant target stimuli is initiated by the faster of two separate target detection processes. Such models make a prediction about the probability distributions of reaction times that is often called the race model inequality, and it is often of interest to test this prediction. In this article, we describe a precise algorithm that can be used to test the race model inequality and present MATLAB routines and a Pascal program that implement this algorithm.

CC834	74390377	Green Supply Chain Management Enablers: Mixed Methods Research	Rameshwar Dubey	Drivers of Supplier Sustainability: Moving Beyond Compliance to Commitment	"[""Kai Foerstl"", ""Arash Azadegan"", ""Thomas Leppelt"", ""Evi Hartmann""]"	"type=""main"" xml:id=""jscm12067-abs-0001""> Mounting pressure for sustainable business practices has led to a greatly increased focus on highlighting sustainability drivers throughout the supply chain. While the literature has concentrated on why downstream original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and retailers become ""sustainable,"" much less is known regarding why and how upstream suppliers implement sustainability practices. Based on findings from a cross-case analysis of eight first-tier (FT) suppliers and an integration of resource dependency theory (RDT), this study explores the drivers and mechanisms of FT supplier engagement in sustainable supply chain management. Suppliers need to understand the sustainability priorities of customers and stakeholders to derive the effective focus and depth of further upstream integration with subsuppliers. Therefore, the integration between the two functions that manage the relevant external interfaces, namely marketing (downstream and stakeholder communication) and procurement (upstream), appears to be the essential cornerstone to move beyond FT supplier compliance to actual commitment to sustainability practices. We present findings on how (1) stakeholder-related, (2) process-related, and (3) product-related drivers influence the choice and effectiveness of the procurement-marketing integration (PM integration) mechanisms. Stakeholder pressures are considered to be the principal drivers of sustainability efforts. However, on their own, they rarely provide sufficient grounds for permanent and embedded PM integration initiatives at FT suppliers. Evidence suggests that suppliers' commitment to PM integration is motivated by the opportunity to leverage sustainability initiatives in their product offerings and sustainability certificates recognizable by customers and secondary stakeholders."

Each S then lay down in a moderately illuminated room, isolated from Es, under instructions to ""relax, but stay awake."" At 6 randomly selected times, an E gave a signal. The S then reported his very last presignal mental experience and answered a series of questions about it. On most trials, Ss reported endogenous sensory imagery. Of all reports, 19% were described by Ss as hallucinatory, and 25% were reliably judged as regressive. Hallucination and regression were relatively independent report characteristics, rarely occurring together. By both subjective and EEG-EOG criteria, Ss were awake when experiencing this hallucinatory and/or regressive mentation. Results suggest that (a) sleep-mentation retrieval and analysis techniques can be applied fruitfully to waking-thought samples; (b) relaxed waking thought is fairly susceptible to momentary intrusions of bizarre content or hallucination; (c) such qualities emerge in a variety of psychophysiological conditions and without any extraordinary induction techniques; and (d) the paradigm opens interesting new possibilities for studying similarities and differences between waking and sleeping thought."

CC1840	29411898	Action and Valence Modulate Choice and Choice-Induced Preference Change	Raphael Koster	When Does Action Elicit More Regret Than Inaction and Is Counterfactual Mutation the Mediator of This Effect?	"[""Ahogni N'gbala"", ""Nyla R. Branscombe""]"	Norm theory's prediction that actions are more mutable than inactions and, as a consequence, will elicit more regret following a negative outcome was tested in two experiments. Action and inaction mutation frequencies were assessed in a design where both types of behaviors were presented together and when information about only one type was described. In Experiment 1, Kahneman and Tversky's (1982a) original scenario, where the action or inaction was instrumentally related to the negative outcome, was employed. More intense regret was obtained for the acting target than the nonacting one, but only when the information about both targets was presented simultaneously and not when either was presented alone. More importantly, action was not more frequently mutated than inaction and what was mutated was uncorrelated with the regret ratings. Instead, the active target's regret was correlated with the perceived wisdom of the nonacting target's behavioral choice when both targets were presented together and could be compared. In Experiment 2, where the action and inaction were not instrumentally related to the negative outcome, no emotional amplification was observed and inaction was targeted for mutation more often than was action. Discussion focuses on an alternative mechanism, besides mutability, that can account for differential emotion elicitation and on specifying the conditions under which the emotion effect will or will not occur.	This asymmetry of regret for action and inaction has been linked to a number of possible explanations and mediating factors including sense of agency [1], cognitive accessibility [2], and differential mutability [3,#AUTHOR_TAG].

Nonetheless, the application of innovative experimental approaches highlighted that members of the same gene sub-family often have different functional specificities. In this work, two closely related Qc-SNAREs--the AtSYP51 and the AtSYP52--are compared in their ability to influence different secretory pathways. Their role in the vesicle sorting to the central vacuole has been revised and they were found to have a novel inhibitory function. When transiently overexpressed, the SYP51 and the SYP52 distributed between the TGN and the tonoplast. Our data demonstrate that these SYPs (syntaxin of plants) act as t-SNARE when present on the membrane of TGN/PVC, whereas they behave as inhibitory or interfering SNAREs (i-SNAREs) when they accumulate on the tonoplast. Moreover, the performed functional analysis indicated that the AtSYP51 and the AtSYP52 roles differ in the traffic to the vacuole. The findings are a novel contribution to the functional characterization of plant SNAREs that reveals additional non-fusogenic roles.	Recently we observed for Arabidopsis SYP51 and SYP52 a double localization associated to two different functions (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012).

This paper surveys key developments in understanding the global warming problem that have occurred since 1992. For example, anthropogenic sulphates have been found to have a significant cooling effect. Halocarbons, once thought to be the most potent greenhouse gases, are now believed to have only a slight global warming effect because they destroy ozone, itself a strong greenhouse gas. Furthermore, case studies in various regions of the world have improved our ability to predict future damages from global warming. These developments have strong implications for the economic consequences of the greenhouse effect and motivated an update of the PAGE model.

CC2844	13505261	Topography discretization techniques for Godunov-type shallow water numerical models: a comparative study	Georges Kesserwani	Adaptive quadtree simulation of shallow flows with wetâ€“dry fronts over complex topography	"[""Qiuhua Liang"", ""Alistair G.L. Borthwick""]"	Many natural terrains have complicated surface topography. The simulation of steep-fronted flows that occur after heavy rainfall flash floods or as inundation from dyke breaches is usually based on the non-linear shallow water equations in hyperbolic conservation form. Particular challenges to numerical modellers are posed by the need to balance correctly the flux gradient and source terms in Godunov-type finite volume shock-capturing schemes and by the moving wetÐdry boundary as the flood rises or falls. This paper presents a Godunov-type shallow flow solver on adaptive quadtree grids aimed at simulating flood flows as they travel over natural terrain. By choosing the stage and discharge as dependent variables in the hyperbolic non-linear shallow water equations, a new deviatoric formulation is derived that mathematically balances the flux gradient and source terms in cases where there are wetÐdry fronts. The new formulation is more general in application than previous a priori approaches. Three benchmark tests are used to validate the solver, and include steady flow over a submerged hump, flow disturbances propagating over an elliptical-shaped hump, and free surface sloshing motions in a vessel with a parabolic bed. The model is also used to simulate the propagation of a flood due to a dam break over an initially dry floodplain containing three humps.	The Etta-SWE approach was further improved and verified for a MUSCL second-order scheme in the work of #AUTHOR_TAG and Borthwick (2009).

CC568	82846198	Voice, (inter-)subjectivity, and real time recurrent interaction	Fred Cummins	Joint speech: The missing link between speech and music?	"[""Fred Cummins""]"	This paper argues that music and speech are not accidentally related as some have claimed. The argument is made by emphasising the coordinative aspects to speaking and music making, and downplaying the role of message passing with which linguistics has traditionally been concerned. A continuum is identified from silent speech on one hand to full blown music and song on the other. At each point, we see different coordinative forms and opportunities among subjects. Joint speech, where a group of people say the same text at the same time, is identified as an important point on this continuum, linking speech and music. Joint speech is familiar from collective prayer, protest chants, and many other contexts in which group purpose finds expression. An experimental form of joint speech, called synchronous speech, has been studied and some findings are recounted here. However the larger question of how and why joint speaking arises remains to be studied. I present a dynamical systems perspective on the coordination that joint speakers employ and show how it can account for some, but not yet all, aspects of the observed phenomenon. A fala conjunta: O elo perdido entre a fala e a musica? Resumo:  Este artigo discute que a musica e a fala nao sao acidentalmente relacionadas, como alguns ja afirmaram. A discussao enfatiza os aspectos coordenativos de fa- lar e fazer musica, e minimiza o papel da comunicacao de mensagens (message passing) com o qual a linguistica tem se preocupado tradicionalmente. Identifica- se um continuum que vai da fala silenciosa, de um lado, ate a cancao em sua ple- nitude, de outro. Em cada ponto, vemos diferentes formas e oportunidades coor- denativas entre esses objetos. A fala conjunta, quando um grupo de pessoas diz o mesmo texto, ao mesmo tempo, e identificada como uma questao importante nes- se continuum, ligando fala e musica. A fala conjunta e comum na prece coletiva, em gritos de protesto e em muitos outros contextos em que o proposito do grupo encontra expressao. Uma forma experimental de fala conjunta, denominada fala sincronica, tem sido estudada e alguns resultados sao aqui descritos. No entanto, a questao mais ampla de como e por que surge a fala conjunta precisa ainda ser estudada. Apresento uma perspectiva de sistemas dinamicos acerca da coordena- cao empregada pelos individuos que falam em conjunto e mostro como ela pode explicar alguns, mas nao todos, aspectos do fenomeno observado.

CC507	6503095	Turkish Voter Response to Government Incompetence and Corruption Related to the 1999 Earthquakes	Ali Akarca	Corruption and Growth	"[""P. Mauro""]"	Corruption in the public sector erodes tax compliance and leads to higher tax evasion. Moreover, corrupt public officials abuse their public power to extort bribes from the private agents. In both types of interaction with the public sector, the private agents are bound to face uncertainty with respect to their disposable incomes. To analyse effects of this uncertainty, a stochastic dynamic growth model with the public sector is examined. It is shown that deterministic excessive red tape and corruption deteriorate the growth potential through income redistribution and public sector inefficiencies. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that the increase in corruption via higher uncertainty exerts adverse effects on capital accumulation, thus leading to lower growth rates.Corruption, growth, public goods, tax evasion, uncertainty	M��on and Sekkat (2005), Pellegrini and Gerlagh (2004), Mo (2001), and  #AUTHOR_TAG (1995) find that it leads to lower investment.

This is due to a lack of empirical testing of the factors that distinguish partnerships from other relational forms and a limited research focus on characteristics that distinguish between polar relationship types. Using a framework developed from the political economy literature this exploratory study draws on an empirical base of 155 supplier questionnaires and uses multiple discriminant analysis to identify attributes of buyer-supplier relationships that most effectively discriminate between relationships classified by suppliers as having limited coordination, being highly coordinated or best described as a partnership. The results indicate that 8 of the 10 attributes of buyer-supplier relationships included in the framework differ significantly across relationship type. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We base our review on the social shaping of the human mind and discuss various aspects of brain function related to social interaction. Despite private mental contents, people can share their understanding of the world using, beyond verbal communication, nonverbal cues such as gestures, facial expressions, and postures. The understanding of nonverbal messages is supported by the brain's mirroring systems that are shaped by individual experience. Within the organism-environment system, tight links exist between action and perception, both within an individual and between several individuals. Therefore, any comprehensive brain imaging study of the neuronal basis of social cognition requires appreciation of the situated and embodied nature of human cognition, motivating simultaneous monitoring of brain and bodily functions within a socially relevant environment. Because single-person studies alone cannot unravel the dynamic aspects of interpersonal interactions, it seems both necessary and beneficial to move towards ""two-person neuroscience""; technological shortcomings and a limited conceptual framework have so far hampered such a leap. We conclude by discussing some major disorders of social interaction."

Henshilwood"", ""Curtis\u00a0W. Marean""]"	Archaeology's main contribution to the debate over the origins of modern humans has been investigating where and when modern human behavior is first recognized in the archaeological record. Most of this debate has been over the empirical record for the appearance and distribution of a set of traits that have come to be accepted as indicators of behavioral modernity. This debate has resulted in a series of competing models that we explicate here, and the traits are typically used as the test implications for these models. However, adequate tests of hypotheses and models rest on robust test implications, and we argue here that the current set of test implications suffers from three main problems: (1) Many are empirically derived from and context-specific to the richer European record, rendering them problematic for use in the primarily tropical and subtropical African continent. (2) They are ambiguous because other processes can be invoked, often with greater parsimony, to explain their character. (3) Many lack theoretical justification. In addition, there are severe taphonomic problems in the application of these test implications across differing spans of time. To provide adequate tests of these models, archaeologists must first subject these test implications to rigorous discussion, which is initiated here. christopher s. henshilwood is Professor at the Centr	But the torrent of art, technology, ritual and symbolism that is deemed the distinctive signature of Home sapiens is seen to develop momentum somewhat later, with the change being particularly dramatic at the Middle/Upper Paleolithic transition in western Europe (#AUTHOR_TAG and Marean, 2003).

CC391	55853555	WHAT DETERMINES CARPOOLING TO WORKPLACES IN BELGIUM: LOCATION, ORGANISATION, OR PROMOTION?	Thomas Vanoutrive	Multilevel Statistical Models	"[""Harvey Goldstein""]"	Adaptive multilevel splitting algorithms have been introduced rather recently for estimating tail distributions in a fast and efficient way. In particular, they can be used for computing the so-called reactive trajectories corresponding to direct transitions from one metastable state to another. The algorithm is based on successive selection-mutation steps performed on the system in a controlled way. It has two intrinsic parameters, the number of particles/trajectories and the reaction coordinate used for discriminating good or bad trajectories. We investigate first the convergence in law of the algorithm as a function of the timestep for several simple stochastic models. Second, we consider the average duration of reactive trajectories for which no theoretical predictions exist. The most important aspect of this work concerns some systems with two degrees of freedom. They are studied in details as a function of the reaction coordinate in the asymptotic regime where the number of trajectories goes to infinity. We show that during phase transitions, the statistics of the algorithm deviate significatively from known theoretical results when using non-optimal reaction coordinates. In this case, the variance of the algorithm is peaking at the transition and the convergence of the algorithm can be much slower than the usual expected central limit behavior. The duration of trajectories is affected as well. Moreover, reactive trajectories do not correspond to the most probable ones. Such behavior disappears when using the optimal reaction coordinate called committor as predicted by the theory. We finally investigate a three-state Markov chain which reproduces this phenomenon and show logarithmic convergence of the trajectory durations.Comment: 23 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in the Journal of   Computational physics.

Fifty-two weeks after inclusion, 328 patients were evaluated by the same psychometric tests as at baseline and the end of treatment (24 weeks).The exposure therapy group and the placebo group had a further improvement in scores on social phobia during follow-up: mean change in the Clinical Global Impression - Social Phobia overall severity score was 0.45 (95% CI 0.16-0.65, P < 0.01) for the exposure group, and 0.25 (95% CI 0.00-0.48, P < 0.05) for the placebo group. At week 52 the sertraline plus exposure group and the sertraline-alone group had a significant deterioration on the 36-item Short Form Health Survey compared with exposure alone.Exposure therapy alone yielded a further improvement during follow-up, whereas exposure therapy combined with sertraline and sertraline alone showed a tendency towards deterioration after the completion of treatment.

The median survival was 43 years among women and 36 years among men, but women had higher relative mortality, when compared with the corresponding population, than men (RMR = 1.40). The median survival time was 45 years among young-onset patients (21-30 years) and 23 years among older-onset patients (51-60 years), but young-onset patients had higher relative mortality than older-onset patients, as shown by a significant reduction by 10-year interval of age at onset (RMR = 0.65). Median survival from onset was longer (43 years) among relapsing-remitting MS than primary progressive MS ([PPMS]; 49 years), and the relative mortality was higher in the PPMS group, (RMR = 1.55). According to death certificates, 57% died from MS.Female patients and patients with young onset had longer median time to death but higher relative risk of dying compared with the corresponding population.

CC1490	46115365	Why is Measured Productivity so Low in Agriculture?	Berthold Herrendorf	Getting Income Shares Right	"[""Douglas Gollin""]"	Many widely used economic models implicitly assume that income shares should be identical across time and space. Although time series data from industrial countries appear consistent with this notion, cross-section data generally appear to contradict the assumption of constant income shares. A commonly used calculation suggests that labor shares of national income vary from about 0.05 to about 0.80 in international cross-section data. This paper suggests, however, that this widely used approach underestimates the labor income of the self-employed and other proprietors. Several adjustments for calculating labor shares are identified and compared. All of them yield data that appear broadly consistent with the hypothesis that labor shares for most countries fall in the range of 0.65 to 0.80self employment, factor shares, income shares, labor shares	Using the method of #AUTHOR_TAG (2002), we find 0.67 for non-agriculture and 0.44 for agriculture in the US during 1980US during -2009, implying that the labor share in non-agriculture is larger than in agriculture.

Participants were asked to indicate by a button press to which category a movement belonged. We computed event-related desynchronization (ERD) in alpha and beta frequency bands between 7.5 and 25 Hz relative to a visual baseline condition. Power in alpha and lower beta frequency bands was significantly reduced if dancers watched dance movements but not if non-dancers watched dance movements, in particular between 1 and 2 s after movement onset. During observation of everyday movements no such group difference was evident. Thus, ERD in alpha and beta frequency bands was modulated by a participant's expertise with a certain movement style. The results are discussed in light of a human observation-execution matching system similar to the macaque mirror neuron system and strengthen the idea of a functional relationship between such a system and rhythmical activity in the alpha and beta frequency bands.

We then construct a supersymmetric theory that is consistent with all the symmetries expected of a multiple M2-brane theory: 16 supersymmetries, conformal invariance, and an SO(8) R-symmetry that acts on the eight transverse scalars. The gauge field is not dynamical.

This investigation inquires whether a similar relationship occurs when arousal is measured electrodermally, and whether nonspecific (spontaneous) electrodermal activity is associated with self-generated thoughts about current concerns. In the first experiment, subjects listened to audiotaped sequences of three-word clusters associated with previously measured own current concerns or with concerns of others. Mean skin conductance responses were significantly larger for clusters related to subjects' own concerns than for those related to others' concerns, although many subjects contributing to this effect showed some awareness of the hypothesis. In the second experiment, thoughts that accompanied nonspecific skin conductance responses received significantly higher self-ratings for concern-relatedness and arousal than thoughts that occurred during electrodermal inactivity. In Experiment 3, they were rated higher for current-concern content and anxiety and lower for mental imagery and dormant-concern content than thoughts during electrodermal inactivity.

The purpose of this exploratory study is to understand knowledge brokering from the perspective of IT professionals as they reflect upon their work practice.  As knowledge brokers, IT professionals see themselves as facilitating the flow of knowledge about both IT and business practices across the boundaries that separate work units within organizations.  A qualitative analysis of interviews conducted with 23 IT professionals and business users in a large manufacturing and distribution company is summarized in a conceptual framework showing the conditions, practices, and consequences of knowledge brokering by IT professionals.  The framework suggests that brokering practices are conditioned by structural conditions, including decentralization and a federated IT management organization, and by technical conditions, specifically shared IT systems that serve as boundary objects.  Brokering practices include gaining permission to cross organizational boundaries, surfacing and challenging assumptions made by IT users, translation and interpretation, and relinquishing ownership of knowledge.  Consequences of brokering are the transfer of both business and IT knowledge across units in the organization	From fieldwork observations, and informed by our theoretical discussion of Scandinavian Institutionalism, we could see that translation, transfusion and repackaging of knowledge and ideas does not take place in a vacuum, but is a social integration process in which specific actors play a role (Czarniawska and Sevon, 2005; see also #AUTHOR_TAG and Robey, 2004).

CC288	18509190	Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities: evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	Vincent Homburg	Reinventing Local Governments and the Eâ€Government Initiative	"[""A T Ho""]"	The Internet provides a powerful tool for reinventing local governments. It encourages transformation from the traditional bureaucratic paradigm, which emphasizes standardization, departmentalization, and operational cost-efficiency, to the Òe-governmentÓ paradigm, which emphasizes coordinated network building, external collaboration, and customer services. Based on a content analysis of city Web sites and a survey of Web development officials, this article shows that many cities are already moving toward this new paradigm. These cities have adopted Òonestop shoppingÓ and customer-oriented principles in Web design, and they emphasize external collaboration and networking in the development process rather than technocracy.

Woollams"", ""Elisa Cooper-Pye"", ""John R. Hodges"", ""Karalyn Patterson""]"	This study was designed to explore the nature of the anomia that is a defining feature of semantic dementia. Using a pool of 225 sets of picture naming data from 78 patients, we assessed the effects on naming accuracy of several characteristics of the target objects or their names: familiarity, frequency, age of acquisition and semantic domain (living/non-living). We also analysed the distribution of different error types according to the severity of the naming deficit. A particular focus of the study was the impact on naming of a previously unconsidered variable: the typicality of an object within its semantic category. This factor had a major influence both on naming success and on the proportions of different error types. Moreover, and increasingly so with declining naming accuracy, the patients' single-word incorrect responses were more typical than the target names. The observed effects of typicality sit well within models of semantic memory that represent concepts in terms of patterns of co-occurrence of constituent features. The results add to a growing body of evidence that, throughout the progressive deterioration of conceptual knowledge that characterises semantic dementia, both accuracy of performance and the nature of error responses are increasingly determined by the domain-specific aspects of typicality relevant to the task in question.

CC1597	1683841	Evolution in Archaeology	Stephen Shennan	Cultural Transmission Theory and the Archaeological Record: Providing Context to Understanding Variation and Temporal Changes in Material Culture	"[""Jelmer W. Eerkens"", ""Carl P. Lipo""]"	Cultural transmission (CT) is implicit in many explanations of culture change. Formal CT models were defined by anthropologists 30 years ago and have been a subject of active research in the social sciences in the ensuing years. Although increasing in popularity in recent years, CT has not seen extensive use in archaeological research, despite the quantitative rigor of many CT models and the ability to create testable hypotheses. Part of the reason for the slow adoption, we argue, has been the continuing focus on change in central tendency and mode in archaeology, instead of change in dispersion or variance. Yet archaeological research provides an excellent data source for exploring processes of CT. We review CT research in the anthropological sciences and outline the benefits and drawbacks of this theoretical framework for the study of material culture. We argue that CT can shed much light on our understandings of why material technology changes over time, including explanations of differential rates of change among different technologies. We further argue that transmission processes are greatly affected by the content, context, and mode of transmission and fundamentally structure variation in material culture. Including ideas from CT can provide greater context for explaining and understanding changes in the variation of artifacts over time. Finally, we outline what we feel should be the goals of CT research in archaeology in the coming years.

CC1737	82073833	Distilling Pathophysiology from Complex Disease Genetics	Aravinda Chakravarti	Genetics of diabetes â€“ Are we missing the genes or the disease?	"[""Leif Groop"", ""Flemming Pociot""]"	Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of different organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. Several pathogenic processes are involved in the development of diabetes. These range from autoimmune destruction of the beta-cells of the pancreas with consequent insulin deficiency to abnormalities that result in resistance to insulin action (American Diabetes Association, 2011). The vast majority of cases of diabetes fall into two broad categories. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), the cause is an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion, whereas in type 2 diabetes (T2D), the cause is a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. However, the subdivision into two main categories represents a simplification of the real situation, and research during the recent years has shown that the disease is much more heterogeneous than a simple subdivision into two major subtypes assumes. Worldwide prevalence figures estimate that there are 280 million diabetic patients in 2011 and more than 500 million in 2030 (http://www.diabetesatlas.org/). In Europe, about 6-8% of the population suffer from diabetes, of them about 90% has T2D and 10% T1D, thereby making T2D to the fastest increasing disease in Europe and worldwide. This epidemic has been ascribed to a collision between the genes and the environment. While our knowledge about the genes is clearly better for T1D than for T2D given the strong contribution of variation in the HLA region to the risk of T1D, the opposite is the case for T2D, where our knowledge about the environmental triggers (obesity, lack of exercise) is much better than the understanding of the underlying genetic causes. This lack of knowledge about the underlying genetic causes of diabetes is often referred to as missing heritability (Manolio et al., 2009) which exceeds 80% for T2D but less than 25% for T1D. In the following review, we will discuss potential sources of this missing heritability which also includes the possibility that our definition of diabetes and its subgroups is imprecise and thereby making the identification of genetic causes difficult.

Anderson""]"	Sensemaking is the active process of constructing a meaningful representation (i.e., making sense) of some complex aspect of the world. In relation to intelligence analysis, sensemaking is the act of finding and interpreting relevant facts amongst the sea of incoming reports, images, and intelligence. We present a cognitive model of core information-foraging and hypothesis-updating sensemaking processes applied to complex spatial probability estimation and decision-making tasks. While the model was developed in a hybrid symbolic-statistical cognitive architecture, its correspondence to neural frameworks in terms of both structure and mechanisms provided a direct bridge between rational and neural levels of description. Compared against data from two participant groups, the model correctly predicted both the presence and degree of four biases: confirmation, anchoring and adjustment, representativeness, and probability matching. It also favorably predicted human performance in generating probability distributions across categories, assigning resources based on these distributions, and selecting relevant features given a prior probability distribution. This model provides a constrained theoretical framework describing cognitive biases as arising from three interacting factors: the structure of the task environment, the mechanisms and limitations of the cognitive architecture, and the use of strategies to adapt to the dual constraints of cognition and the environment.</p	A similar approach to bridging CL and ARL theories also does so by memory retrieval mechanisms based on relevance to the current context (Anderson, 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013;.

Smith"", ""Andrew Faulkner""]"	"Simulations of cochlear implants have demonstrated that the deleterious effects of a frequency misalignment between analysis bands and characteristic frequencies at basally shifted simulated electrode locations are significantly reduced with training. However, a distortion of frequency-to-place mapping may also arise due to a region of dysfunctional neurons that creates a ""hole"" in the tonotopic representation. This study simulated a 10 mm hole in the mid-frequency region. Noise-band processors were created with six output bands (three apical and three basal to the hole). The spectral information that would have been represented in the hole was either dropped or reassigned to bands on either side. Such reassignment preserves information but warps the place code, which may in itself impair performance. Normally hearing subjects received three hours of training in two reassignment conditions. Speech recognition improved considerably with training. Scores were much lower in a baseline (untrained) condition where information from the hole region was dropped. A second group of subjects trained in this dropped condition did show some improvement; however, scores after training were significantly lower than in the reassignment conditions. These results are consistent with the view that speech processors should present the most informative frequency range irrespective of frequency misalignment."

CC1219	93144659	A Review of Psychometric Data Analysis and Applications	Geraldine Gray	Exploring individual differences as determining factors in student academic achievement in higher education	"[""Simon Cassidy""]"	study investigated the association and relative influence of  cognitive/motivational and demographic factors on final degree grade point average (GPA) in a single undergraduate cohort. Although academic selfefficacy, approaches to learning, prior achievement and age all produced significant correlations with GPA, regression analysis identified prior achievement, age and academic self-efficacy as the only significant predictors of GPA. Significant increases in academic self-efficacy, deep and strategic approaches to learning and self-confidence, and a significant decrease in internal locus of control were also reported when comparing first and final year scores. Conclusions suggested that prior academic achievement, age  and academic self-efficacy provide a partial explanation for academic achievement in higher education, that any measure of prior achievement must be relevant, that self-efficacy appears to be the most relevant perceived  control construct in a learning context, and that further work focusing on age in the context of academic achievement in higher education is both necessary and warranted	It remains an active research topic (Buckingham Shum & Deakin Crick, 2012;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2011;Komarraju, Ramsey & Rinella, 2013), indicating the inherent difficulty in both measurement of learning (Knight, Buckinham Shum, & Littleton, 2013;Tempelaar et al., 2013), and modelling the learning process, particularly in tertiary education (Pardos et al., 2011).

CC1855	1388501	Work-Related Psychological Health Among Clergy Serving in The Presbyterian Church (USA): Testing the Idea of Balanced Affect	Leslie Francis	Changes in burnout over the first 12 months in ministry: Links with stress and orientation to ministry	"[""Maureen H. Miner""]"	Working in Christian ministry is stressful because it is focused on the intangible spirituality of people within a secularized society. Consequently, clergy are at risk of burnout. An internal orientation to the demands of ministry (where ministers depend on internal sources of authority and coping, such as spirituality and competence) is associated with low burnout in cross-sectional studies of ministers. However, little is known about stressors in early ministry and whether an internal ministry orientation is associated with burnout over the first year of ministry. Sixty graduating theological students completed demographic items, exploratory questions relating to the psychological effects of secularization, and measures of burnout, personality, and orientation to ministry. Most of these measures, together with ratings of stress and coping, were repeated after 12 months. Burnout increased over time in ministry, and ministers reported that ministry and relational issues were most stressful. Those with only a weakly internal orientation to ministry demands experienced higher levels of burnout on exit from theological college, and after 12 months. The results support a prediction from secularization theory, that the declining authority of ministers will have important consequences for their psychological health.

No statistical assumptions are used, all effects are due to the behavior of distinct modes. Classical energy spectra $E_\o \sim \o^{-\nu}, \ \nu= \const >0,$ for dispersion function of the form $ \o \sim k^{\a}, \ \a>0$ are obtained as a particular case of a more general form of energy spectra: $E_{\o} \sim \o^{-\nu}, \ 2+\a^{-1}\le \nu \le 2(2+\a^{-1})$ where magnitude of $\nu$ is defined by the parameters of the initial excitation.

CC2339	9323912	Parental Characteristics, Family Structure and Occupational Attainment in Britain	Richard Lampard	Family Composition and Children s Educational Outcomes	"[""M Iacovou""]"	This paper explores the relationship between sibship structure and educational outcomes, in the context of theories of dilution of parental time. Special efforts are made to disentangle the effects of family size and birth order, since these effects have often been confounded in the past. Children from larger families are found to do worse than children from smaller families, and children lower down the birth order do worse than those higher up the birth order. These findings are consistent with theoretical predictions, but the finding that only children perform worse than those from two-child families, even controlling for a whole range of parental and school characteristics, is not. This paper suggests that as well as inputs from parents, interactions with other children may be important in children's educational development: this idea is supported by the finding that mixing with other children outside school reduces the disadvantage otherwise associated with being an only child. Additionally, the important finding emerges that only children are at much more of a disadvantage on mathematically-based measures of performance than on language-based measures, suggesting that these skills may be acquired via different processes.

This contribution aims to develop a new perspective on specific investments that accounts for their value-adding character and also to present a transaction-centred definition of customer relationships.Design/methodology/approach - The contribution draws on a comparative review on literature on business networks and economic theories focused on industrial buying behaviour.Findings - Provides a transaction-related definition of customer relationships in order to distinguish between different kinds of relationships and provides a framework to how relationship management is able to enhance marketing activities.Practical implications - Specific investments are a powerful tool for differentiating the market offerings of a company.

Ward"", ""Veena Kumari"", ""Philip B. Mitchell"", ""Gordon B. Parker"", ""Belinda Ivanovski"", ""Perminder Sachdev""]"	Individuals with bipolar disorder manifest the full spectrum of emotions ranging from depression to mania. In attempting to understand the functional substrates of mood we attempted to identify brain regions associated with the cognitive generation of affect in bipolar depressed patients. We therefore examined ten depressed female subjects with bipolar affective disorder, and ten age-matched and sex-matched healthy comparison subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing alternating blocks of captioned pictures designed to evoke negative, positive or no affective change. The activation paradigm involved the presentation of the same visual materials over three experiments alternating (experiment 1) negative and reference; (experiment 2) positive and reference and (experiment 3) positive and negative captioned pictures. The stimuli produced activation in both patients and comparison subjects in brain regions previously implicated in the generation and modulation of affect, in particular the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. The activation in patients, when compared with healthy subjects, involved additional subcortical regions, in particular the amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus and medial globus pallidus. Patients and comparison subjects displayed differential sensitivity to affective change with negative (experiment 1) and positive (experiment 2) affect induction producing converse patterns of activation. We conclude that bipolar depressed patients perhaps recruit additional subcortical limbic systems for emotional evaluation and this may reflect state-related or trait-related dysfunction. The differential patterns of activation inform us about bipolar depression and have potential diagnostic and therapeutic significance.

CC861	74390377	Green Supply Chain Management Enablers: Mixed Methods Research	Rameshwar Dubey	Drivers of green supply management performance: Evidence from Germany	"[""Rudolf O. Large"", ""Cristina Gimenez Thomsen""]"	Five potential drivers of green supply management performance were identified in the literature review: green supply management capabilities, the strategic level of the purchasing department, the level of environmental commitment, the degree of green supplier assessment, and the degree of green collaboration with suppliers. These constructs were used to form a structural model explaining the environmental performance and the purchasing performance. The model was analysed with SmartPLS 2.0 using data collected among German purchasers. The results suggest that the degree of green supplier assessment and the level of green collaboration exert direct influence on environmental performance. These two practices are driven by the strategic level of the purchasing department and the level of environmental commitment of the firm. Whereas commitment influences green assessment directly, the impact of commitment on green collaboration is mediated by the capabilities of the purchasing department. Furthermore, the results show that environmental performance has a positive impact on purchasing performance.

Gabrielli"", ""A. Montresor"", ""L. Chitsulo"", ""D. Engels"", ""L.

The strategy is widely implemented worldwide but its general theoretical foundations have not been described so far in a comprehensive and cohesive manner. Starting from the information available on the biological and epidemiological characteristics of helminth infections, as well as from the experience generated by disease control and elimination interventions across the world, we extrapolate the fundamentals and synthesise the principles that regulate PC and justify its implementation as a sound and essential public health intervention. The outline of the theoretical aspects of PC contributes to a thorough understanding of the different facets of this strategy and helps comprehend opportunities and limits of control and elimination interventions directed against helminth infections.

Despite decades of effort, we still face daunting challenges to promote wider acceptance of AFVs by the general public. More empirical analyses are needed to understand the technology adoption process associated with different market structures, the effectiveness of regulations and incentives, and the density of infrastructure adequate to reach sustainable commercial application. This paper compares the adoption of natural gas vehicles (NGVs) in eight countries: Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Italy, New Zealand, Pakistan, and the US. It examines the major policies aimed at promoting the use of NGVs, instruments for implementing those policies and targeting likely stakeholders, and a range of factors that influence the adoption of NGVs. The findings in this paper should be applicable to other AFVs. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rizzoli""]"	SNARE proteins mediate membrane fusion in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. Genetic deletion and siRNA-based knockdown have been instrumental in assigning given SNAREs to defined intracellular transport steps. However, SNARE depletion occasionally results in barely detectable phenotypes. To understand how cells cope with SNARE loss, we have knocked down several SNAREs functioning in early endosome fusion. Surprisingly, knockdown of syntaxin 13, syntaxin 6 and vti1a, alone or in combinations, did not result in measurable changes of endosomal trafficking or fusion. We found that the residual SNARE levels (typically approximately 10%) were sufficient for a substantial amount of SNARE-SNARE interactions. Conversely, in wild-type cells, most SNARE molecules were concentrated in clusters, constituting a spare pool not readily available for interactions. Additionally, the knockdown organelles exhibited enhanced docking. We conclude that SNAREs are expressed at much higher levels than needed for maintenance of organelle fusion, and that loss of SNAREs is compensated for by the co-regulation of the docking machinery.	This consideration was first formulated by Bethani and co-workers upon analysis of a rich literature showing that knockdown of some SNARE genes have little effect on endomembranes (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009, and references within).

CC2235	81800077	Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	Fabio Reale	What is Moss 	"[""T.E. Berger"", ""B. De Pontieu"", ""L. Fletcher"", ""C.J. Schrijver"", ""T.D. Tarbell"", ""A.M. Title""]"	TRACE observations of active regions show a peculiar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission over certain plage areas. Termed `moss' for its spongy, low-lying, appearance, observations and modeling imply that the phenomenon is caused by thermal conduction from 3-5 MKcoronal loops overlying the plage: moss is the upper transition region emission of hot coronal loops. The spongy appearance is due to the presence of chromospheric jets or `spicules' interspersed with the EUV emission elements. High cadence TRACE observations show that the moss EUV elements interact with the chromospheric jets on 10 s time scales. The location of EUV emission in the moss does not correlate well to the locations of underlying magnetic elements in the chromosphere and photosphere, implying a complex magnetic topology for coronal loop footpoint regions.

Kaser"", ""M. Grosshauser"", ""B. Marzeion""]"	Abstract Knowledge of climate change and its impacts can facilitate adaptation efforts. However, complex system dynamics, data scarcity, and heterogeneity often generate both contradictory findings and unexpected climate change impacts. Here we present local ecological knowledge of climate and ecological change in central Tibet to support the finding of delayed summer on the Tibetan Plateau, a finding that has been subject to vigorous, ongoing debate based on Western scientific data. Tibetans who actively herd on a daily basis and are located at higher elevations were most likely to notice changes in seasonality, reported as later start of summer and green-up, and as delayed and shortened livestock milking season. Local meteorological data, indigenous observations of higher snowlines and long-term animal number data suggest that a regional warming trend, rather than land use change, may underlie the delayed phenology trends. We demonstrate that local ecological knowledge can reveal counter-intuitive outcomes and help resolve apparent contradictions through its strengths in situations of high variability, ability to integrate over a range of variables and time scales, and operation outside of Western scientific logic. This suggests local knowledge does not exist to be confirmed or disproved by Western science, but rather can also advance Western science and help contribute to its debates. It is precisely points of apparent contradiction within and between knowledge systems that are most productive for more extensive inquiry. Future research on climate change, and climate adaptation policy-making, will benefit from careful, contextual dialog with local observations, focusing on observable biophysical phenomena that are affected by temperature and precipitation and that are important to livelihoods.	It also takes account of potential complications caused by the different approaches of scientific groups in an interdisciplinary setting and by bringing together epistemologies represented by Western scientific knowledge with peasants' local knowledge (e.g., Boelens, 2014;Escobar, 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014;Lennox and Gowdy, 2014).

In this paper we derive from quantum theory the optical force, its first-order velocity dependence, and its fluctuations for arbitrary light intensity, and apply the results to the problem of creating a stable optical trap for sodium atoms. New results include the position dependence of the velocity-dependent force, a complete expression for the momentum diffusion constant including the substantial contribution from fluctuations of the dipole force, and an estimate of trapping times in excess of 1 sec even in the absence of effective damping. The paper concludes with a discussion of the prospects and difficulties in providing sufficient damping to stabilize such a trap.

This paper presents an overview of tendencies in sociological and anthropological studies of morality, ethics and bioethics, and suggests that a lack in philosophical interest might be related to a tendency among social scientists to employ either a deficit model (social science perspectives accommodate the sense of context that philosophical ethics lacks), a replacement model (social scientists have finally found the ""right way"" of doing ethics), or a dismissal model (ethics should be abandoned all together as a misconstrued veil of power). Increased awareness of differences in styles of reasoning and objects of research interest might help to overcome the hostility, and an anthropological project is presented as an invitation to a dialogue informed by awareness of such differences."

Thomas Vanoutrive	Carpooling and carpool clubs: Clarifying concepts and assessing value enhancement possibilities through a Stated Preference web survey in Lisbon, Portugal	"[""Gon\u00e7alo Correia"", ""Jos\u00e9 Manuel Viegas""]"	The increase of urban traffic congestion calls for studying alternative measures for mobility management, and one of these measures is carpooling. In theory, these systems could lead to great reductions in the use of private vehicles; however, in practice they have obtained limited success for two main reasons: the psychological barriers associated with riding with strangers and poor schedule flexibility. To overcome some of the limitations of the traditional schemes, we proposed studying a carpooling club model with two main new features: establishing a base trust level for carpoolers to find compatible matches for traditional groups and at the same time allowing to search for a ride in an alternative group when the pool member has a trip schedule different from the usual one. A web-based survey was developed for the Lisbon Metropolitan Region (Portugal), including a Stated Preference experiment, to test the concept and confirm previous knowledge on these systems' determinants. It was found through a binary logit Discrete Choice Model calibration that carpooling is still attached with lower income strata and that saving money is still an important reason for participating in it. The club itself does not show promise introducing more flexibility in these systems; however, it should provide a way for persons to interact and trust each other at least to the level of working colleagues.Carpooling Commuter trips Discrete Choice Modeling Stated Preference surveys Transport Demand Management Urban transport	In the literature most authors distinguish between householdbased and non-household-based carpools which are also called internal and external carpools respectively (Buliung et al., 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG and Viegas, 2011;Ferguson, 1997a;Morency, 2007;Teal, 1987).

CC722	79497095	The Cost Effectiveness of Psychological and Pharmacological Interventions for Social Anxiety Disorder: A Model-Based Economic Analysis	Ifigeneia Mavranezouli	Optimal treatment of social phobia: systematic review and meta-analysis	"[""Paul Glue""]"	This article proposes a number of recommendations for the treatment of generalized social phobia, based on a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. An optimal treatment regimen would include a combination of medication and psychotherapy, along with an assertive clinical management program. For medications, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are first-line choices based on their efficacy and tolerability profiles. The nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitor, phenelzine, may be more potent than these two drug classes, but because of its food and drug interaction liabilities, its use should be restricted to patients not responding to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. There are other medication classes with demonstrated efficacy in social phobia (benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, alpha-2-delta ligands), but due to limited published clinical trial data and the potential for dependence and withdrawal issues with benzodiazepines, it is unclear how best to incorporate these drugs into treatment regimens. There are very few clinical trials on the use of combined medications. Cognitive behavior therapy appears to be more effective than other evidence-based psychological techniques, and its effects appear to be more enduring than those of pharmacotherapy. There is some evidence, albeit limited to certain drug classes, that the combination of medication and cognitive behavior therapy may be more effective than either strategy used alone. Generalized social phobia is a chronic disorder, and many patients will require long-term support and treatment.

Elliott"", ""B. J. Sahakian"", ""K. Matthews"", ""A. Bannerjea"", ""J. Rimmer"", ""T. W. Robbins""]"	Abstract Previous studies of the effects of the psychomotor stimulant, methylphenidate, have concentrated on vigilance and reaction time tasks. In this study, the effects of methylphenidate on more complex aspects of cognition were studied using tasks from the CANTAB battery and related tests which have been shown to be sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction. Twenty-eight young healthy men participated in a counterbalanced, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of methylphenidate. Cognitive assessment included tests of spatial working memory, planning, verbal fluency, attentional set-shifting and sustained attention. Methylphenidate had significant effects on performance of the tests of spatial working memory and planning but not on the attentional and fluency tests. When the drug was taken on the first test session, performance on the spatial tests was enhanced by the drug compared to placebo. However, when the drug was taken second, performance accuracy was impaired whereas response latencies were decreased. These results are consistent with a hypothesis that methylphenidate influences performance in two conflicting ways; enhancing executive aspects of spatial function on novel tasks but impairing previously established performance. This pattern of effects is discussed within the framework of dual, interacting arousal mechanisms.	Deviations from these optimal levels, including increases of local tonic dopamine concentrations and dopamine turnover, lead to impaired striatal and cortical mechanisms underlying working memory, sensory discrimination, and planning (Murphy et al., 1996;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1997;Liu et al., 2008), which may underlie the working memory deficits seen in drug abusers (Ornstein et al., 2000).

CC2170	82152711	Potential Vulnerabilities of Neuronal Reward, Risk, and Decision Mechanisms to Addictive Drugs	Wolfram Schultz	Two types of dopamine neuron distinctly convey positive and negative motivational signals	"[""Masayuki Matsumoto"", ""Okihide Hikosaka""]"	Midbrain dopamine neurons are activated by reward or sensory stimuli predicting reward. These excitatory responses increase as the reward value increases. This response property has led to a hypothesis that dopamine neurons encode value-related signals and are inhibited by aversive events. Here we show that this is true only for a subset of dopamine neurons. We recorded the activity of dopamine neurons in monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during a Pavlovian procedure with appetitive and aversive outcomes (liquid rewards and airpuffs directed at the face, respectively). We found that some dopamine neurons were excited by reward-predicting stimuli and inhibited by airpuff-predicting stimuli, as the value hypothesis predicts. However, a greater number of dopamine neurons were excited by both of these stimuli, inconsistent with the hypothesis. Some dopamine neurons were also excited by both rewards and airpuffs themselves, especially when they were unpredictable. Neurons excited by the airpuff-predicting stimuli were located more dorsolaterally in the substantia nigra pars compacta, whereas neurons inhibited by the stimuli were located more ventromedially, some in the ventral tegmental area. A similar anatomical difference was observed for their responses to actual airpuffs. These findings suggest that different groups of dopamine neurons convey motivational signals in distinct manners.	Generalization in the first component of dopamine responses occurs with neutral stimuli (Schultz and Romo, 1990;Waelti et al., 2001), aversive stimuli (Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1996;Joshua et al., 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG and Hikosaka, 2009), explicit nonreward predicting stimuli (conditioned inhibitors; Tobler et al., 2003), and delay-predicting stimuli (Kobayashi and Schultz, 2008).

CC1449	54847651	Intuitive and Reflective Responses in Philosophy	Nick Byrd	Telling More Than We Can know: Verbal Reports on mental Processes	"[""Richard E Nisbett"", ""Stuart Valins""]"	Reviews evidence which suggests that there may be little or no direct introspective access to higher order cognitive processes. Ss are sometimes (a) unaware of the existence of a stimulus that importantly influenced a response, (b) unaware of the existence of the response, and (c) unaware that the stimulus has affected the response. It is proposed that when people attempt to report on their cognitive processes, that is, on the processes mediating the effects of a stimulus on a response, they do not do so on the basis of any true introspection. Instead, their reports are based on a priori, implicit causal theories, or judgments about the extent to which a particular stimulus is a plausible cause of a given response. This suggests that though people may not be able to observe directly their cognitive processes, they will sometimes be able to report accurately about them. Accurate reports will occur when influential stimuli are salient and are plausible causes of the responses they produce, and will not occur when stimuli are not salient or are not plausible causes.

Effect sizes were computed through the method invented by Glass (Glass, McGaw, & Smith, 1981). Correlations and effect-size groups were tested for consistency and significance with inferential statistics by Hedges and Olkin (1985). Test anxiety (TA) causes poor performance. It relates inversely to studentsÕ self-esteem and directly to their fears of negative evaluation, defensiveness, and other forms of anxiety. Conditions (causes) giving rise to differential TA levels include ability, gender, and school grade level. A variety of treatments are effective in reducing test anxiety.

Even though the use of this rating scale requires trained raters, it is commonly deployed without prior training in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability and the agreement of CGAS ratings with an expert rating, in a clinical setting with untrained raters. Five experienced clinicians rated five vignettes to provide expert ratings. These vignettes were then rated by 703 health-care professionals representing 33 Swedish CAMHS. The health-care professionals rated the vignettes significantly higher (showing better global functioning) than the expert ratings. There was a wide range between the minimum and maximum ratings. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.73, which indicates moderate inter-rater reliability. Neither clinical experience nor earlier experience of using CGAS influenced the agreement with the expert ratings. The inter-rater reliability is moderate when CGAS is used in a clinical setting with untrained raters. Further, the untrained raters differed substantially from the experts. This stresses the importance of proper training in conjunction with the introduction of new rating scales.	Interestingly within a group of participants untrained in the CGAS, 84% of doctors and 73% of psychologists were within ��5 points of an expert group consensus rating, suggesting that with the instructions in the measure alone high reliability can be reached by many professionals (#AUTHOR_TAG, Kowalski, Sundberg, Gumpert, & Landen, 2010).

Questionnaire consisted of three parts. In first part responded were requested to provide demographic information. In second part the respondents were asked to provide information concerning their religion or world view through several questions enquiring after religious or ideological affiliation, religious or ideological self-definition, view on life after death, image of God, spirituality, importance of rituals in their life, religious practice, and importance of religion in life. The third part consisted of a list of attitudinal statements regarding different treatment decisions in advanced disease on which the respondents had to give their opinion using a five-point Likert scale.99 physician responded.WE WERE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH FOUR CLUSTERS: Church-going physicians, infrequently church-going physicians, atheists and doubters. We found that like the Belgian general public, many Flemish palliative care physicians concoct their own religious or ideological identity and feel free to drift away from traditional religious and ideological authorities.In our research we noted that physicians who have a strong belief in God and express their faith through participation in prayer and rituals, tend to be more critical toward euthanasia. Physicians who deny the existence of a transcendent power and hardly attend religious services are more likely to approve of euthanasia even in the case of minors or demented patients. In this way this study confirms the influence of religion and world view on attitudes toward euthanasia.

Feld"", ""R. Saers"", ""A. Widera"", ""T. M\u00fcller"", ""I. Bloch""]"	Tunnelling of material particles through a classically impenetrable barrier constitutes one of the hallmark effects of quantum physics. When interactions between the particles compete with their mobility through a tunnel junction, intriguing novel dynamical behaviour can arise where particles do not tunnel independently. In single-electron or Bloch transistors, for example, the tunnelling of an electron or Cooper pair can be enabled or suppressed by the presence of a second charge carrier due to Coulomb blockade. Here we report on the first direct and time-resolved observation of correlated tunnelling of two interacting atoms through a barrier in a double well potential. We show that for weak interactions between the atoms and dominating tunnel coupling, individual atoms can tunnel independently, similar to the case in a normal Josephson junction. With strong repulsive interactions present, two atoms located on one side of the barrier cannot separate, but are observed to tunnel together as a pair in a second order co-tunnelling process. By recording both the atom position and phase coherence over time, we fully characterize the tunnelling process for a single atom as well as the correlated dynamics of a pair of atoms for weak and strong interactions. In addition, we identify a conditional tunnelling regime, where a single atom can only tunnel in the presence of a second particle, acting as a single atom switch. Our work constitutes the first direct observation of second order tunnelling events with ultracold atoms, which are the dominating dynamical effect in the strongly interacting regime. Similar second-order processes form the basis of superexchange interactions between atoms on neighbouring lattice sites of a periodic potential, a central component of quantum magnetism.Comment: 18 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in Natur	In this paper, we extend the JZ proposal and discuss a new scheme based on an optical superlattice [25,#AUTHOR_TAG] to generate a gauge potential leading to (1).

CC1340	2068614	Scanning the Parameter Space of Holographic Superconductors	Obinna Umeh	Stability in gauged extended supergravity	"[""Peter Breitenlohner"", ""Daniel Z Freedman""]"	Extended supergravity theories with gauged SO(N) internal symmetry have, for N ³ 4, scalar field potentials which are unbounded below. Nevertheless, it is argued that the theories have ground states with anti-de Sitter background geometry which are stable against fluctuations which vanish sufficiently fast at spatial infinity. Stability is implied because the appropriate conserved energy functional is positive for such fluctuations. Anti-de Sitter space is not globally hyperbolic, but the boundary conditions required for positive energy are also shown to give free field theories with well-defined Cauchy problem. New information on the particle representations of OSp(1, 4) supersymmetry is presented as part of the argument. Supersymmetry requires boundary conditions for spin 0 fields such that only the improved stress tensor leads to a conserved energy functional. Although the stability arguments support the view that gauged supergravity theories are acceptable quantum field theories, the problem of a large cosmological term in the Ads phase of the theories is still unsolved.

Carli"", ""M. Sarchiapone"", ""C. Hoven"", ""D. Wasserman"", ""M.

These symptoms are especially prevalent in childhood and adolescence. Longitudinal research has demonstrated that psychotic symptoms in adolescence increase the risk of psychotic disorder in adulthood. There has been a lack of research, however, on the immediate clinicopathological significance of psychotic symptoms in adolescence.To investigate the relationship between psychotic symptoms and non-psychotic psychopathology in community samples of adolescents in terms of prevalence, co-occurring disorders, comorbid (multiple) psychopathology and variation across early v. middle adolescence.Data from four population studies were used: two early adolescence studies (ages 11-13 years) and two mid-adolescence studies (ages 13-16 years). Studies 1 and 2 involved school-based surveys of 2243 children aged 11-16 years for psychotic symptoms and for emotional and behavioural symptoms of psychopathology. Studies 3 and 4 involved in-depth diagnostic interview assessments of psychotic symptoms and lifetime psychiatric disorders in community samples of 423 children aged 11-15 years.Younger adolescents had a higher prevalence (21-23%) of psychotic symptoms than older adolescents (7%). In both age groups the majority of adolescents who reported psychotic symptoms had at least one diagnosable non-psychotic psychiatric disorder, although associations with psychopathology increased with age: nearly 80% of the mid-adolescence sample who reported psychotic symptoms had at least one diagnosis, compared with 57% of the early adolescence sample. Adolescents who reported psychotic symptoms were at particularly high risk of having multiple co-occurring diagnoses.Psychotic symptoms are important risk markers for a wide range of non-psychotic psychopathological disorders, in particular for severe psychopathology characterised by multiple co-occurring diagnoses. These symptoms should be carefully assessed in all patients.	In contrast to the transient AVH, persistent AVH appear to increase the risk for depressed mood and general psychopathology in longitudinal studies (De Loore, Gunther, Drukker et al., 2011), and AVH in later adolescence appears to have stronger association with psychiatric disorders compared to AVH in younger age groups (#AUTHOR_TAG, Keeley, Corcoran et al., 2012b).	['Thus, developmental processes may influence the prevalence, as AVH appear to decrease throughout adolescence.', 'Consistent with this view, Bartels-Velthuis, Van de Willige, Jenner, Van Os and Wiersma (2011) found that approximately two thirds of children reporting hearing voices at ages 7-8 did not report such experiences five years later.', 'In contrast to the transient AVH, persistent AVH appear to increase the risk for depressed mood and general psychopathology in longitudinal studies (De Loore, Gunther, Drukker et al., 2011), and AVH in later adolescence appears to have stronger association with psychiatric disorders compared to AVH in younger age groups (#AUTHOR_TAG, Keeley, Corcoran et al., 2012b).', 'Similarly, Rubio, Sanju an, Fl orez-Salamanca and Cuesta (2012) reported in a systematic review an increased prevalence of AVH in younger age.', 'AVH were in most cases transient, whereas the persistence of AVH or transition to psychosis was suggested to be related to the severity of the hallucinatory experience (Rubio et al., 2012).']	0	['In contrast to the transient AVH, persistent AVH appear to increase the risk for depressed mood and general psychopathology in longitudinal studies (De Loore, Gunther, Drukker et al., 2011), and AVH in later adolescence appears to have stronger association with psychiatric disorders compared to AVH in younger age groups (#AUTHOR_TAG, Keeley, Corcoran et al., 2012b).']

This study investigates how the cognitive search strategies of 80 participants might vary with Web experience as they engaged in two researcher-defined tasks and two participant-defined information seeking tasks. Each of the two researcher-defined tasks and participant-defined tasks included a directed search task and a general-purpose browsing task.

Participants with higher levels of Web experience were more likely to use ÒParallel playerÓ, ÒParallel hub-and-spokeÓ, ÒKnown address search domainÓ and ÒKnown addressÓ strategies, whereas participants with lower levels of Web experience were more likely to use ÒVirtual touristÓ, ÒLink-dependentÓ, ÒTo-the-pointÓ, ÒSequential playerÓ, ÒSearch engine narrowingÓ, and ÒBroad firstÓ strategies.

Mark"", ""Adam French"", ""Jeffrey Bury"", ""Kenneth R. Young"", ""Jeffrey M. McKenzie""]"	Summary Glacier shrinkage caused by climate change is likely to trigger diminished and less consistent stream flow in glacier-fed watersheds worldwide. To understand, model, and adapt to these climate-glacier-water changes, it is vital to integrate the analysis of both water availability (the domain of hydrologists) and water use (the focus for social scientists). Drawn from a case study of the Santa River watershed below Peru's glaciated Cordillera Blanca mountain range, this paper provides a holistic hydro-social framework that identifies five major human variables critical to hydrological modeling because these forces have profoundly influenced water use over the last 60 years: (1) political agendas and economic development; (2) governance: laws and institutions; (3) technology and engineering; (4) land and resource use; and (5) societal responses. Notable shifts in Santa River water use--including major expansions in hydroelectricity generation, large-scale irrigation projects, and other land and resource-use practices--did not necessarily stem from changing glacier runoff or hydrologic shifts, but rather from these human variables. Ultimately, then, water usage is not predictable based on water availability alone. Glacier runoff conforms to certain expected trends predicted by models of progressively reduced glacier storage. However, societal forces establish the legal, economic, political, cultural, and social drivers that actually shape water usage patterns via human modification of watershed dynamics. This hydro-social framework has widespread implications for hydrological modeling in glaciated watersheds from the Andes and Alps to the Himalaya and Tien Shan, as well as for the development of climate change adaptation plans.

Our goal is to help players and network providers to estimate the amount of traffic caused by the game and the impact on access links or provider networks. It also enables other researchers to use a realistic Halo 2 traffic model in network simulations. We focus on the following characteristics: bandwidth, packet rate and distribution of packet inter-arrival times and packet lengths. We compare the results with a previous analysis of Halo 1 and find some major differences - the client packet rate has been reduced, packet sizes have no longer a single fixed value per game and the mean packet size has decreased (so Halo 2 requires less bandwidth). Finally we develop traffic simulation models for Halo 2 and compare them against the experimentally obtained data.

By mapping the electronic database containing all relevant journals in mathematics and neuro-science for an eight-year period (1991-98), we infer the dynamic and the structural mechanisms that govern the evolution and topology of this complex system.   First, empirical measurements allow us to uncover the topological measures that characterize the network at a given moment, as well as the time evolution of these quantities.   The results indicate that the network is scale-free, and that the network evolution is governed by preferential attachment, affecting both internal and external links.   However, in contrast with most model predictions the average degree increases in time, and the node separation decreases.   Second, we propose a simple model that captures the network's time evolution.   Third, numerical simulations are used to uncover the behavior of quantities that could not be predicted analytically.Comment: 14 pages, 15 figure	Many studies have used the relationships between authors of a document to study broad domains such as physics (Newman, 2001a) and mathematics (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2002).

Thomas Vanoutrive	Role of Busâ€Based Park and Ride in the UK: A Temporal and Evaluative Review	"[""Stuart Meek"", ""Stephen Ison"", ""Marcus Enoch""]"	The number of bus-based Park and Ride schemes in the UK has grown substantially over the past 40 years as a result of its encouragement by the Government as a tool to deal with increasing traffic congestion and traffic-related pollution. The aim of this paper is to analyse the degree to which Park and Ride is effective in the contemporary policy context. The authors identify phases of development of Park and Ride since its emergence as a local solution to transport capacity constraints in historic towns. Policy goals are identified against which a review of literature is used to highlight its effectiveness. It is concluded that Park and Ride may increase the distance travelled by its users due to low load factors on dedicated buses, public transport abstraction and trip generation, although it is highlighted that there are areas in which further research is required to clarify its impacts	For the same reason, we do not advise the introduction of carpool lanes in Belgian cities.

Pomin"", ""Ana Paula Valente"", ""Mariana S. Pereira"", ""Paulo A.S. Mour\u00e3o""]"	Sulfated fucans from marine invertebrates have simple, linear structures, composed of repeating units of oligosaccharides. Most of these polysaccharides contain 3-linked fucosyl units, but each species of invertebrate has a specific pattern of sulfation. No specific enzyme able to cleave or to desulfate these polysaccharides has been described yet. Therefore, we employed an alternative approach, based on mild acid hydrolysis, in an attempt to obtain low molecular-weight derivatives from sulfated fucans. Surprisingly, we observed that sulfated fucans from Lytechinus variegatus and Strongylocentrotus pallidus (but not the sulfated fucans from other species) yield by mild acid hydrolysis oligosaccharides with well-defined molecular size as shown by narrow bands in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The sulfated oligosaccharides obtained by mild acid hydrolysis were purified by gel-filtration chromatography, and their structures were identified by (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, revealing an identical chemical composition for all oligosaccharides. When we followed the acid hydrolysis by (1)H-NMR spectroscopy, we found that a selective 2-desulfation occurs in the fucans from S. pallidus and from L. variegatus. The reaction has two stages. Initially, 2-sulfate esters at specific sites are removed. Then the desulfated units are cleaved, yielding oligosaccharides with well-defined molecular size. The apparent requirement for the selective 2-desulfation is the occurrence of an exclusively 2-sulfated fucosyl unit linked to or preceded by a 4-sulfated residue. Thus, a homofucan from Strongylocentrotus franciscanus resists desulfation by mild acid hydrolysis, because it lacks the neighboring 4-sulfated unit. Overall, our results show a new approach for desulfating sulfated fucans at specific sites and obtaining tailored sulfated oligosaccharides.	In an attempt to obtain low molecular-weight derivatives from sulfated fuco-oligosaccharides, results based on mild acid hydrolysis were also reported (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005).

Neuropsychiatric conditions, including intellectual disability, autism and epilepsy, are highly prevalent in TSC populations.

CC2273	81800077	Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	Fabio Reale	MULTI-STRAND CORONAL LOOP MODEL AND FILTER-RATIO ANALYSIS	"[""Sofiane Bourouaine"", ""Eckart Marsch""]"	We model a coronal loop as a bundle of seven separate strands or filaments. Each of the loop strands used in this model can independently be heated (near their left footpoints) by Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron waves via wave-particle interactions. The Alfv\'en waves are assumed to penetrate the strands from their footpoints, at which we consider different wave energy inputs. As a result, the loop strands can have different heating profiles, and the differential heating can lead to a varying cross-field temperature in the total coronal loop. The simulation of TRACE observations by means of this loop model implies two uniform temperatures along the loop length, one inferred from the 171:195 filter ratio and the other from the 171:284 ratio. The reproduced flat temperature profiles are consistent with those inferred from the observed EUV coronal loops. According to our model, the flat temperature profile is a consequence of the coronal loop consisting of filaments, which have different temperatures but almost similar emission measures in the cross-field direction. Furthermore, when we assume certain errors in the simulated loop emissions (e.g., due to photometric uncertainties in the TRACE filters) and use the triple-filter analysis, our simulated loop conditions become consistent with those of an isothermal plasma. This implies that the use of TRACE/EIT triple filters for observation of a warm coronal loop may not help in determining whether the cross-field isothermal assumption is satisfied or not	One such model addressed the evidence of flat TRACE/EIT filter-ratios along loops that were explained by the multi-filament loop structure (#AUTHOR_TAG and Marsch, 2010).

Diagnostic methods used to identify and determine exposure to chemical warfare agents, toxins, and poisons traditionally involve blood collection by phlebotomists, cold transport of biomedical samples, and costly sample preparation techniques. Use of dried blood spots, which consist of dried blood on an FDA-approved substrate, can increase analyte stability, decrease infection hazard for those handling samples, greatly reduce the cost of shipping/storing samples by removing the need for refrigeration and cold chain transportation, and be self-prepared by potentially exposed individuals using a simple finger prick and blood spot compatible paper. Our laboratory has developed clinical assays to detect human exposures to nerve agents through the analysis of specific protein adducts and metabolites, for which a simple extraction from a dried blood spot is sufficient for removing matrix interferents and attaining sensitivities on par with traditional sampling methods. The use of dried blood spots can bridge the gap between the laboratory and the field allowing for large scale sample collection with minimal impact on hospital resources while maintaining sensitivity, specificity, traceability, and quality requirements for both clinical and forensic applications.CC999999/Intramural CDC HHS/United States2017-05-13T00:00:00Z27942095PMC513968	Source detection was performed using CIAO (Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2006).

CC2450	2016794	Evaluation of new spin foam vertex amplitudes	Igor Khavkine	The classical and quantum 6j symbols	"[""J S Carter"", ""D E Flath"", ""M Saito""]"	Addressing physicists and mathematicians alike, this book discusses the finite dimensional representation theory of sl(2), both classical and quantum. Covering representations of U(sl(2)), quantum sl(2), the quantum trace and color representations, and the Turaev-Viro invariant, this work is useful to graduate students and professionals. The classic subject of representations of U(sl(2)) is equivalent to the physicistsÕ theory of quantum angular momentum. This material is developed in an elementary way using spin-networks and the Temperley-Lieb algebra to organize computations that have posed difficulties in earlier treatments of the subject. The emphasis is on the 6j-symbols and the identities among them, especially the Biedenharn-Elliott and orthogonality identities. The chapter on the quantum group Ub-3.0 qb0(sl(2)) develops the representation theory in strict analogy with the classical case, wherein the authors interpret the Kauffman bracket and the associated quantum spin-networks algebraically. The authors then explore instances where the quantum parameter q is a root of unity, which calls for a representation theory of a decidedly different flavor. The theory in this case is developed, modulo the trace zero representations, in order to arrive at a finite theory suitable for topological applications. The Turaev-Viro invariant for 3-manifolds is defined combinatorially using the theory developed in the preceding chapters. Since the background from the classical, quantum, and quantum root of unity cases has been explained thoroughly, the definition of this invariant is completely contained and justified within the text.

Design Cross sectional analysis. Setting Flanders, Belgium.A stratified at random sample was drawn of people who died between 1 June 2007 and 30 November 2007. The certifying physician of each death was sent a questionnaire on end of life decision making in the death concerned.The rate of euthanasia cases reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee; physicians' reasons for not reporting cases of euthanasia; the relation between reporting and non-reporting and the characteristics of the physician and patient; the time by which life was shortened according to the physician; the labelling of the end of life decision by the physician involved; and differences in characteristics of due care between reported and unreported euthanasia cases.The survey response rate was 58.4% (3623/6202 eligible cases). The estimated total number of cases of euthanasia in Flanders in 2007 was 1040 (95% CI 970 to 1109), thus the incidence of euthanasia was estimated as 1.9% of all deaths (95% CI 1.6% to 2.3%). Approximately half (549/1040 (52.8%, 95% CI 43.9% to 60.5%)) of all estimated cases of euthanasia were reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee. Physicians who perceived their case as euthanasia reported it in 93.1% (67/72) of cases. Cases of euthanasia were reported less often when the time by which life was shortened was less than one week compared with when the perceived life shortening was greater (37.3% v 74.1%; P<0.001). Unreported cases were generally dealt with less carefully than reported cases: a written request for euthanasia was more often absent (87.7% v 17.6% verbal request only; P<0.001), other physicians and caregivers specialised in palliative care were consulted less often (54.6% v 97.5%; 33.0% v 63.9%; P<0.001 for both), the life ending act was more often performed with opioids or sedatives (92.1% v 4.4%; P<0.001), and the drugs were more often administered by a nurse (41.3% v 0.0%; P<0.001).One out of two euthanasia cases is reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee. Most non-reporting physicians do not perceive their act as euthanasia. Countries debating legalisation of euthanasia should simultaneously consider developing a policy facilitating the due care and reporting obligations of physicians.

The Adaboost algorithm has been applied to learn fuzzy rules in classification problems, and other backfitting algorithms to learn fuzzy rules in modeling problems but, up to our knowledge, there are not previous works that extend the Logitboost algorithm to learn fuzzy rules in classification problems. In this work, Logitboost is applied to learn fuzzy rules in classification problems, and its results are compared with that of Adaboost and other fuzzy rule learning algorithms. Contradicting the expected results, it is shown that the basic extension of the backfitting algorithm to learn classification rules may produce worse results than Adaboost does. We suggest that this is caused by the stricter requirements that Logitboost demands to the weak learners, which are not fulfilled by fuzzy rules. Finally, it is proposed a prefitting based modification of the Logitboost algorithm that avoids this problem"	This non-deterministic model of the data can represent more complex, non-linear class boundaries (#AUTHOR_TAG & S��nchez, 2005;Tang et al., 2012).

As ``Wi-Fi\u27\u27 technology becomes ubiquitous, it is increasingly important to understand trends in the usage of these networks. This paper analyzes an extensive network trace from a mature 802.11 WLAN, including more than 550 access points and 7000 users over seventeen weeks. We employ several measurement techniques, including syslogs, telephone records, SNMP polling and tcpdump packet sniffing. This is the largest WLAN study to date, and the first to look at a large, mature WLAN and consider geographic mobility. We compare this trace to a trace taken after the network\u27s initial deployment two years ago. We found that the applications used on the WLAN changed dramatically. Initial WLAN usage was dominated by Web traffic; our new trace shows significant increases in peer-to-peer, streaming multimedia, and voice over IP (VoIP) traffic. On-campus traffic now exceeds offcampus traffic, a reversal of the situation at the WLAN\u27s initial deployment. Our study indicates that VoIP has been used little on the wireless network thus far, and most VoIP calls are made on the wired network. Most calls last less than a minute. We saw more heterogeneity in the types of clients used, with more embedded wireless devices such as PDAs and mobile VoIP clients. We define a new metric for mobility, the ``session diameter.\u27\u27 We use this metric to show that embedded devices have different mobility characteristics than laptops, and travel further and roam to more access points.

CC1100	2185862	Beryllium Abundances of Solar-Analog Stars 	Yoichi Takeda	Light Elements in the Universe Proc IAU Symp	"[""S Randich""]"	Due to their production sites, as well as to how they are processed and destroyed in stars, the light elements are excellent tools to investigate a number of crucial issues in modern astrophysics: from stellar structure and non-standard processes at work in stellar interiors to age dating of stars; from pre-main sequence evolution to the star formation histories of young clusters and associations and to multiple populations in globular clusters; from Big Bang nucleosynthesis to the formation and chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way Galaxy and its populations, just to cite some relevant examples. In this paper, we focus on lithium, beryllium, and boron (LiBeB) and on carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (CNO). LiBeB are rare elements, with negligible abundances with respect to hydrogen; on the contrary, CNO are among the most abundant elements in the Universe, after H and He. Pioneering observations of light-element surface abundances in stars started almost 70 years ago and huge progress has been achieved since then. Indeed, for different reasons, precise measurements of LiBeB and CNO are difficult, even in our Sun; however, the advent of state-of-the-art ground- and space-based instrumentation has allowed the determination of high-quality abundances in stars of different type, belonging to different Galactic populations, from metal-poor halo stars to young stars in the solar vicinity and from massive stars to cool dwarfs and giants. Noticeably, the recent large spectroscopic surveys performed with multifiber spectrographs have yielded detailed and homogeneous information on the abundances of Li and CNO for statistically significant samples of stars; this has allowed us to obtain new results and insights and, at the same time, raise new questions and challenges. A complete understanding of the light-element patterns and evolution in the Universe has not been still achieved. Perspectives for further progress will open up soon thanks to the new generation instrumentation that is under development and will come online in the coming years.

In this study we examine how Water User Associations in the Eastern Andes of Colombia perceive water scarcity and the relationship between this perception and observed climate, land use, and demographic changes. Results demonstrate a complex relationship between perceptions and observed changes. On the one hand, observed changes in land cover match perceptions of deforestation as the primary cause of increasing water scarcity. On the other hand, perceptions of climate driven changes in water availability are not reflected in observed precipitation data. Furthermore, water scarcity was perceived in regions where seasonal rainfall variability is higher but not in regions where annual rainfall is lower. We discuss how these results contribute to our understanding of adaptation to climate change and the implications of possible mismatches between environmental changes and local perceptions.

CC1483	20652885	Taxon Sampling and the Optimal Rates of Evolution for Phylogenetic Inference	Jeffrey Townsend	Utility of arginine kinase for resolution of phylogenetic relationships among brachyuran genera and families	"[""Brian C. Mahon"", ""Joseph E. Neigel""]"	The molecular phylogenetics of decapod crustaceans has been based on sequence data from a limited number of genes. These have included rapidly evolving mitochondrial genes, which are most appropriate for studies of closely related species, and slowly evolving nuclear ribosomal RNA genes, which have been most useful for resolution of deep branches within the Decapoda. Here we examine the utility of the nuclear gene that encodes arginine kinase for phylogenetic reconstruction at intermediate levels (relationships among genera and families) within the decapod infraorder Brachyura (the true crabs). Analyses based on arginine kinase sequences were compared and combined with those for the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene. All of the genera in our taxon sample were resolved with high support with arginine kinase data alone. However, some of these genera were grouped into clades that are in conflict with recognized brachyuran families. A phylogeny based on cytochrome oxidase I was consistent with the arginine kinase phylogeny, but with weaker support. A recently proposed measure of phylogenetic informativeness indicated that arginine kinase was generally more informative than cytochrome oxidase I for relationships above the level of genus. Combined analysis of data from both genes provided strong support for clades that are in conflict with current assignments of genera to the families Epialtidae, Mithracidae, Pisidae, and Portunidae.	There are both theoretical (Bandelt and Dress 1986) and empirical (Townsend 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG and Neigel 2008;Townsend et al. 2008;Schoch et al. 2009) reasons to believe that the quartet results of Townsend ( 2007) may be productively applied to trees with greater than four taxa.

The core of this phenomenon is therefore stimulus-independent and task-unrelated thoughts (SITUTs).

In Experiment 1, we examined the impact of SITUTs on the performance of the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART; a Go/No-Go task). Analyses demonstrated that SITUTs impair SART performance to the same extent as irrelevant sensory perceptions. In Experiment 2, we further examined SITUTs in order to assess the possible functions of mind-wandering. We observed that the content of most of reported SITUTs refers to the anticipation and planning of future events.

Tracer particles are emitted in bunches from localized sources smaller than the Kolmogorov scale. We report the first quantitative evidence, supported by an unprecedented statistics, of the deviations of relative dispersion from Richardson's picture. Deviations are due to extreme events of pairs separating much faster than average, and of pairs remaining close for long time. The two classes of events are the fingerprints of complete different physics, the former dominated by inertial subrange and large-scale fluctuations, and the latter by dissipation subrange. A comparison of the relative separation in surrogate white-in-time velocity field, with correct viscous-, inertial-, and integral-scale properties, allows us to assess the importance of temporal correlations along tracer trajectories.

Nye""]"	This chapter is concerned with the effects of corruption and suggests hypotheses about the costs and benefits of corruption. If corruption helps promote economic development which is generally necessary to maintain a capacity to preserve legitimacy in the face of social change, then it is beneficial for political development. Although corruption may help promote economic development, it can also hinder it or direct it in socially less desirable directions. It seems fair to assume that a society's political structures will be better able to cope with change and preserve their legitimacy if the members share a sense of community. Indeed, integration is sometimes used as one of the main scales for measuring political development. By destroying the legitimacy of political structures in the eyes of those who have power to do something about the situation, corruption can contribute to instability and possible national disintegration.

A questionnaire was administered to 42 obstetricians and 156 midwives at the same two obstetric units, exploring the reasons for low rates of reporting. Questions concerned their knowledge of their unit's incident reporting system; whether they would report a series of 10 designated adverse obstetric incidents to the risk manager; and their views on 12 potential reasons for not reporting incidents. Most staff knew about the incident-reporting system in their unit, but almost 30% did not know how to find a list of reportable incidents. Views on the necessity of reporting the 10 designated obstetric incidents varied considerably. For example, 96% of staff stated they would always report a maternal death, whereas less than 40% would report a baby's unexpected admission to the Special Care Baby Unit. Midwives said they were more likely to report incidents than doctors, and junior staff were more likely to report than senior staff. The main reasons for not reporting were fears that junior staff would be blamed, high workload and the belief (even though the incident was designated as reportable) that the circumstances or outcome of a particular case did not warrant a report. Junior doctors felt less supported by their colleagues than senior doctors. Current systems of incident reporting, while providing some valuable information, do not provide a reliable index of the rate of adverse incidents. Recommended measures to increase reliability include clearer definitions of incidents, simplified methods of reporting, designated staff to record incidents and education, feedback and reassurance to staff about the nature and purpose of such systems.

CC1244	93144659	A Review of Psychometric Data Analysis and Applications	Geraldine Gray	Motivational Beliefs, Values, and Goals	"[""Jacquelynne S. Eccles"", ""Allan Wigfield""]"	Navajo school students, it is believed, underachieve at school in terms of school attendance, dropout rates, and standardized performance tests. Among the many reasons proposed to explain the persistent school underachievement is that school culture is largely based on individualism, interpersonal competition, and other Western norms and values. These, it is argued, are an anathema to Native Americans. Hence, school culture may predispose many Navajo High School students to failure. To test this belief I constructed a model of school achievement motivation drawn from Western conceptualizations of achievement motivation described Navajo High School students achievement motivation. Using confirmatory factor analyses tests of equivalency were conducted that contrasted non-traditional Navajo students and females with near traditional Navajo students and males. Using structural equation modeling, I examined the relations of the language, location, and gender variables on the achievement goal factors, mediated by school measures of achievement, ability beliefs, social goals and achievement goals. I concluded that non-traditional and near traditional Navajo students are more similar than dissimilar.

CC2261	81800077	Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	Fabio Reale	Scaling Law of Solar Coronal Loops Obtained with YOHKOH	"[""Ryouhei Kano"", ""Saku Tsuneta""]"	We derived the temperature distributions along the 16 steady loops observed with the Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope. We have found that the temperature and emission measure (pressure) are the highest around the loop top, and decrease towards the footpoints. Some of the loops have a plateau in the temperature distribution at around the loop top (&quot;trapezoidal &quot; temperature distribution). The other loops, on the other hand, have a sharp peak in the temperature distributions (&quot;triangular &quot; temperature distribution). This triangular temperature distribution suggests that the energy input is concentrated at the peak. We have estimated the thermal conductive fluxes downward to the footpoints from the gradients of the temperature distributions. The flux ranges from 1 x 107 to 2 x 108 [erg s _ 1 c m- 2]. We derived the total energy loss PS T 5 which is the sum of the conductive and radiative losses: PSx = 2 x 107-3 x 108 [erg s _ 1 c m- 2]. We discovered a good correlation between the total energy loss and the gas pressure pg for the steady loops: PS T = 1.2 x 1 0 7 P g &quot;  +- 0 1 2. The correlation is consistent with the theoretical energy scaling law for the steady loops:  PS T = 4.0-5.1 x 103 * (pg * Tm /), where Tm is the maximum temperature (Tm ~ 6 x 106 [K] for all the loops analyzed here)	Another systematic analysis on another sample of Yohkoh loops in active regions (#AUTHOR_TAG and Tsuneta, 1995) confirmed some of the correlations in Porter and Klimchuk (1995), but also found a correlation between the loop length and the temperature, and deviations from RTV scaling laws (Section 4.1.1).

With suitable boundary conditions, the cases of a neutral and purely electric black hole have been studied in various limits and were shown to yield key elements of superconductivity in the dual 2+1 dimensional field theory, forming a condensate below a critical temperature. By adding magnetic charge to the black hole, we immerse the superconductor into an external magnetic field. We show that a family of condensates can form and we examine their structure. For finite magnetic field, they are localized in one dimension with a profile that is exactly solvable, since it maps to the quantum harmonic oscillator. As the magnetic field increases, the condensate shrinks in size, which is reminiscent of the Meissner effect.Comment: 13 pages, LaTeX, 5 figures. v2: Clarified and revised some of the   discussio	For example, the authors of [#AUTHOR_TAG,18,19,20,21,22] mapped the phase diagram of the holographic superconductors in the presence of an external magnetic field.

These resources have been described as patients' embodied knowledge of health and illness. The notion of embodiment as an essential part for health is a relatively new idea in modern Western society and is poorly theorized in models for health promotion. This study explored patterns of patients` experiences/bodily knowledge and actions that contribute to well-being and health in chronic illness. This study is the first to examine Bodyknowledging, which is a process that describes the utilization of bodily knowledge to engage in health-related change. Methods: Grounded theory methodology informed data collection and analysis. In-depth interviews were conducted with 56 men and women who were diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disease or stroke. Results: Participants` main concerns were the uncertainty, hindrances and limitations of life space introduced by illness. Bodyknowledging, revealed patients` embodied knowledge of coping and health as a powerful resource for successful disease management, prevention of relapses and promotion of health. Conclusion: The findings illuminate the importance of attending to personal resources and relational aspects of health, and it adds to the empirical and theoretical basis for utilizing peoples' embodied knowledge in health promotion	The theory asserts that individuals with chronic illness have bodily knowledge that constitutes an important resource for coping and health, and that patient's bodily knowledge is developed through a dynamic, nonlinear process of learning and health-related change in interaction with the environment #AUTHOR_TAG.

Warren""]"	Few studies examine the mechanisms that link body image to sexual satisfaction in women. Using the tenets of objectification theory, this study investigated the relationships between body surveillance, body shame, body self-consciousness during sexual activities, and sexual satisfaction in an ethnically diverse sample of American female college students (N=368), while controlling for relationship status and body mass index. Results based on self-report measures of these constructs suggested that body shame and body self-consciousness during sexual activity were negatively correlated with sexual satisfaction. Additionally, path analysis indicated that body surveillance predicted increased body self-consciousness during sexual activity, partially mediated by body shame. Body self-consciousness, in turn, predicted decreased sexual satisfaction. Overall, study findings highlight the negative consequences of body image concerns for women's sexual satisfaction.

Manlove""]"	The goal of this study was to examine, in consort, a variety of factors which have either been previously associated with burnout or which, for theoretical and empirical reasons, would be expected to be associated with burnout. Subjects included 188 child care workers from licensed child care centers in predominantly rural areas of Pennsylvania. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess the extent to which personality (neuroticism, extraversion), background characteristics (education/training, work experience), and perceptions of the work setting (work role conflict, work role ambiguity, organizational commitment, job satisfaction) were associated with three facets of burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment). The results indicate that neuroticism, work role conflict, and work role ambiguity were positively associated with higher levels of burnout as measured by all three facets. Higher levels of organizational commitment were significantly associated with less emotional exhaustion and greater personal accomplishment. Those reporting better supervisor and co-worker relations as well as more autonomy at work reported significantly lower levels of depersonalization. Those with more education/training and work experience reported significantly higher levels of personal accomplishment.

The MAG is a heterogeneous graph comprised of over 120 million publication entities and related authors, institutions, venues and fields of study. It is also the largest publicly available dataset of citation data. As such, it is an important resource for scholarly communications research. As the dataset is assembled using automatic methods, it is important to understand its strengths and limitations, especially whether there is any noise or bias in the data, before applying it to a particular task. This article studies the characteristics of the dataset and provides a correlation analysis with other publicly available research publication datasets to answer these questions. Our results show that the citation data and publication metadata correlate well with external datasets. The MAG also has very good coverage across different domains with a slight bias towards technical disciplines. On the other hand, there are certain limitations to completeness. Only 30 million papers out of 127 million have some citation data. While these papers have a good mean total citation count that is consistent with expectations, there is some level of noise when extreme values are considered. Other current limitations of MAG are the availability of affiliation information, as only 22 million papers have these data, and the normalisation of institution names.

CC2217	81800077	Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	Fabio Reale	An Ab Initio Approach to the Solar Coronal Heating Problem	"[""Boris Vilhelm Gudiksen"", ""Ake Nordlund""]"	We present an ab initio approach to the solar coronal heating problem by modelling a small part of the solar corona in a computational box using a 3D MHD code including realistic physics. The observed solar granular velocity pattern and its amplitude and vorticity power spectra, as reproduced by a weighted Voronoi tessellation method, are used as a boundary condition that generates a Poynting flux in the presence of a magnetic field. The initial magnetic field is a potential extrapolation of a SOHO/MDI high resolution magnetogram, and a standard stratified atmosphere is used as a thermal initial condition. Except for the chromospheric temperature structure, which is kept fixed, the initial conditions are quickly forgotten because the included Spitzer conductivity and radiative cooling function have typical timescales much shorter than the time span of the simulation. After a short initial start up period, the magnetic field is able to dissipate 3-4 10^6 ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} in a highly intermittent corona, maintaining an average temperature of $\sim 10^6$ K, at coronal density values for which emulated images of the Transition Region And Coronal Explorer(TRACE) 171 and 195 pass bands reproduce observed photon count rates.Comment: 12 pages, 14 figures.

In line with predictions made in the latter two frameworks, type frequency of a morphological pattern is shown to be important in determining productivity. In addition, the paper considers the nature of lexical schemas in the network model, which are of two types: source-oriented and product-oriented.

I. Gilliland"", ""D. C. Bello""]"	Previous conceptualizations of attitudinal commitment are extended by considering two very different components of a manufacturer's attachment to an independent channel intermediary. Relying on commitment theory, a model is developed that describes how attitudinal commitment may reside in either the instrumental or the social strain of a manufacturer's relationship with its distributor. For each strain, the developmental role played by key facets of the channel setting--relative dependence, pledges, and trust--are shown. Furthermore, the nature of the attachment bond is posited to motivate very different governance mechanisms as the distribution agreement is enforced by either social or contractual means. Empirical support for the model demonstrates that an expanded view of attitudinal commitment is important in understanding the complex nature of attachment in channel relationships.	"The literature suggests that companies maintain relationship bonds either because ""they have to"", due to high switching costs, or because ""they want to"", because of high relationship value (Bendapudi & Berry, 1997;de Ruyter et al., 2001;#AUTHOR_TAG & Bello, 2002;Gounaris, 2005;Liu, 2006)."

Schallberger put forward a hypothesis or hypotheses concerning the magnitude of Swiss IQ gains; in fact, he did not. The erratum includes the author's clarification.] Data from 14 nations reveal IQ gains ranging from 5 to 25 points in a single generation. Some of the largest gains occur on culturally reduced tests and tests of fluid intelligence. The Norwegian data show that a nation can make significant gains on a culturally reduced test while suffering losses on other tests. The Dutch data proved the existence of unknown environmental factors so potent that they account for 15 of the 20 points gained. The hypothesis that best fits the results is that IQ tests do not measure intelligence but rather a correlate with a weak causal link to intelligence. This hypothesis can also explain difficult trends on various mental tests, such as the combination of IQ gains and Scholastic Aptitude Test losses in the United States.

This article questions whether ethics committees are capable of making sound judgments about the ethics of what is proposed and practised in particular research projects. In addition, the legitimacy of such regulation is questioned, on ethical grounds. Finally, it is argued that increased regulation will not raise the 'ethical standard' of social science and will probably worsen the quality of what it produces.	Moreover, the attention of STS researchers to bioethics can, to an extent, be viewed as symptomatic of a wider debate within the social sciences about ethics regulation (see [10,#AUTHOR_TAG]).

CC2211	81800077	Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	Fabio Reale	The pressure and energy balance of the cool corona over sunspots	"[""P. Foukal""]"	We study the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emission of the 22 largest sunspots observed with the ATM SO55 spectrometer. From their time behavior we infer that the pressure and energy balance of the cool corona over these spots is in a steady state. A straightforward analysis of the resolvable temperature structure over several spots shows that conduction across the field lines from the hot corona is of no importance to the energy balance to the cool magnetic loops extending from the umbrae. Also, directly measured radiative losses along the legs of the loops are too large to be entirely balanced by thermal conduction from a heat source located high in the loop. We conclude that a heat input of about 10/sup -4/ ergs cm/sup -3/ s/sup -1/ is required along the full length of the loop, and is largest off the loop axis. The material cannot be supported at the observed heights either hydrostatically or magnetohydrostatically, or by turbulent motions. Taken together, the pressure and energy balance of the cool loops is most simply understood if coronal material is flowing across field lines at the top of the loops and falling downward along both sides under gravity. This analysis suggests that strongmore >> magnetic fields tend to inhibit dissipation of mechanical energy in the corona. We speculate that the corona is heated by transfer of mechanical energy across the very thin transition region immediately over network cell interiors. The magnetic fields of the network, active regions, and filaments simply provide a heat sink on which the hot corona can cool and lose buoyancy. The plasma radiates powerfully in the temperature range 10/sup 4/<< less	These loops are invisible in the X-ray band and many of them depart from sunspots, appear coaxial and are progressively thinner for progressively lower temperature ions (Foukal, 1975(#AUTHOR_TAG , 1976.

Geels""]"	In the last decade 'sectoral systems of innovation' have emerged as a new approach in innovation studies. This article makes four contributions to the approach by addressing some open issues. The first contribution is to explicitly incorporate the user side in the analysis. Hence, the unit of analysis is widened from sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. The second contribution is to suggest an analytical distinction between systems, actors involved in them, and the institutions which guide actor's perceptions and activities. Thirdly, the article opens up the black box of institutions, making them an integral part of the analysis. Institutions should not just be used to explain inertia and stability. They can also be used to conceptualise the dynamic interplay between actors and structures. The fourth contribution is to address issues of change from one system to another. The article provides a coherent conceptual multi-level perspective, using insights from sociology, institutional theory and innovation studies. The perspective is particularly useful to analyse long-term dynamics, shifts from one socio-technical system to another and the co-evolution of technology and society.	In the interests of brevity, the framework is not elaborated here, and the interested reader is referred to Geels [3,#AUTHOR_TAG].

CC1522	14579	THE RELATION BETWEEN CONTENT AND STRUCTURE IN LANGUAGE PRODUCTION: AN ANALYSIS OF SPEECH ERRORS IN SEMANTIC DEMENTIA	Lotte Meteyard	Short-term memory errors for spoken syllables are affected by the linguistic structure of the syllables.	"[""Rebecca Treiman"", ""Catalina Danis""]"	Three experiments on short-term serial memory for spoken syllables are reported. The stimuli were CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) syllables in Experiment 1, CCVs in Experiment 2, and VCCs in Experiment 3. Analyses of subjects' errors showed that the phonemes within a syllable were not equally free to break apart and recombine. Certain groups of phonemes-the vowel-final consonant group of a CVC, the initial cluster of a CCV, and a vowel-liquid group within a VCC-tended to behave as units. These results are consistent with the view that syllables are coded in terms of an onset (initial consonant or cluster) and a rime (remainder). Errors in short-term memory for spoken syllables are affected by the linguistic structure of the syllables.	Normal people make such errors in AVSTM with non-words but not with words (#AUTHOR_TAG & Danis, 1988).

Cuesta""]"	Childhood and adolescence represent the periods during which hallucinatory experiences occur at the greatest prevalence, and also constitute a critical window of vulnerability for the pathogenesis of psychotic disorders. The longitudinal course of hallucinatory experiences during late childhood and adolescence, as well as their relationship to psychotic disorders, has never been the subject of review.We followed the PRISMA guidelines for conducting systematic reviews and combined the use of electronic and manual systematic search methods. Data were extracted upon pre-defined requested items and were analyzed using several epidemiological measures. The interpretation of the results was conducted in relation to the study design variables.A total of 11 datasets (6 epidemiological and 5 clinical) were reviewed. The baseline prevalence of hallucinatory experiences ranged from 4.9% to 9%. Discontinuation occurred in between 58.7% and 94.5% of the cases, and person-year discontinuation rates ranged from 3% to 40.7% and appeared to be related to the duration of follow-up. Despite low person-year incidence rate, incident cases constituted between 27.7% and 83.3% of outcome samples. 2 of 3 studies showed evidence to predict transition to psychosis with likelihood ratios of 2.5 and 6.6.Hallucinatory experiences are a common experience during childhood and adolescence. A review of the current literature suggests that there is a considerable turnover of incident-discontinuing cases and that most cases discontinue in the short term. A subset of the cases was at risk for persistence or transition to psychosis, probably related to indicators of severity of the hallucinatory experience.Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

CC977	30619848	Points in Mental Space: an Interdisciplinary Study of Imagery in Movement Creation	Jon May	Neural Substrates of Spontaneous Musical Performance: An fMRI Study of Jazz Improvisation	"[""Charles J. Limb"", ""Allen R. Braun""]"	To investigate the neural substrates that underlie spontaneous musical performance, we examined improvisation in professional jazz pianists using functional MRI. By employing two paradigms that differed widely in musical complexity, we found that improvisation (compared to production of over-learned musical sequences) was consistently characterized by a dissociated pattern of activity in the prefrontal cortex: extensive deactivation of dorsolateral prefrontal and lateral orbital regions with focal activation of the medial prefrontal (frontal polar) cortex. Such a pattern may reflect a combination of psychological processes required for spontaneous improvisation, in which internally motivated, stimulus-independent behaviors unfold in the absence of central processes that typically mediate self-monitoring and conscious volitional control of ongoing performance. Changes in prefrontal activity during improvisation were accompanied by widespread activation of neocortical sensorimotor areas (that mediate the organization and execution of musical performance) as well as deactivation of limbic structures (that regulate motivation and emotional tone). This distributed neural pattern may provide a cognitive context that enables the emergence of spontaneous creative activity.

This was specifically the case in the mid-sixteenth century, when the Viennese were confronted with one major problem: the Danube River successively abandoned its main arm that ran close to the city and shifted further north. This was at the time when Vienna became the permanent residence of the Holy Roman Empire (except from 1583 to 1611 when it was moved to Prague), due to the Habsburgs holding the crown. Vienna was also the capital of the so-called Danube Monarchy, which came into being in the early sixteenth century. The city assumed increasing significance, being home to and hosting important authorities and persons. In particular after the first siege by the Ottoman army in 1529, the resource need for a complex fortification system was extremely high. This paper aims to highlight: (1) the morphological Danube dynamics together with floods and extreme weather situations in the sixteenth century; (2) the main actors in the trans- formation of the Danube; (3) changes of the river's course from 1550 to 1600/1650 and the consequences for bridging the river and the infrastructure as a whole; (4) the massive engineering measures that were undertaken in order to secure Vienna's requirements in the sixteenth century; (5) the question of floodplain settlements, and (6) the contested use of resources on the Viennese Danube floodplain.

Ozanne""]"	Two of the predominant approaches to gaining knowledge in the social sciences are the positivist and interpretive approaches. Different philosophical assumptions and goals underlie both. We are better able to see the strengths and weaknesses in the two approaches by comparing and contrasting different perspectives; this juxtaposition is essential if we are to improve the ways in which we study consumers. In this article, we demonstrate the influence of assumptions on different research processes, cite problems inherent in both perspectives, point out the range of po-sitions within the interpretive approach, and discuss the ramifications of diverse ways of seeking knowledge for consumer research.

The nature of such bias is not clear. Some authors claim that people aremere heuristic thinkers and are not aware that cued stereotypes might be inap-propriate. Other authors claim that people always detect the conflict between their stereotypical thinking and nor-mative reasoning, but simply fail to inhibit stereotypical thinking.Hence, it is unclearwhether heuristic bias should be attributed to a lack of conflict detection or a failure of inhibition. We introduce a neuroscientific approach that bears on this issue. Participants answered a classic deci-sion-making problem (the ''lawyer-engineer' ' problem) while the activation of brain regions believed to be involved in conflict detection (anterior cingulate) and response in-hibition (lateral prefrontal cortex) wasmonitored.

Darwin observed that evolutionary change in languages greatly resembled the processes of biological evolution: inheritance from a common ancestor and convergent evolution operate in both.

We use this analysis to test competing hypotheses--the ""express-train"" and the ""entangled-bank"" models--for the colonization of the Pacific by Austronesian-speaking peoples. The parsimony analysis of a matrix of 77 Austronesian languages with 5,185 lexical items produced a single most-parsimonious tree.

Jonnalagadda"", ""Pawan Goyal"", ""Mark D. Huffman""]"	Background: Automation of the parts of systematic review process, specifically the data extraction step, may be an important strategy to reduce the time necessary to complete a systematic review. However, the state of the science of automatically extracting data elements from full texts has not been well described. This paper performs a systematic review of published and unpublished methods to automate data extraction for systematic reviews. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, IEEEXplore, and ACM Digital Library to identify potentially relevant articles. We included reports that met the following criteria: 1) methods or results section described what entities were or need to be extracted, and 2) at least one entity was automatically extracted with evaluation results that were presented for that entity. We also reviewed the citations from included reports. Results: Out of a total of 1190 unique citations that met our search criteria, we found 26 published reports describing automatic extraction of at least one of more than 52 potential data elements used in systematic reviews. For 25 (48 %) of the data elements used in systematic reviews, there were attempts from various researchers to extract information automatically from the publication text. Out of these, 14 (27 %) data elements were completely extracted, but the highest number of data elements extracted automatically by a single study was 7. Most of the data elements were extracted with F-scores (a mean of sensitivity and positive predictive value) of over 70 %. Conclusions: We found no unified information extraction framework tailored to the systematic review process, and published reports focused on a limited (1-7) number of data elements. Biomedical natural language processing techniques have not been fully utilized to fully or even partially automate the data extraction step of systematic reviews.	Extracting data elements such as study descriptors from publication full texts is an essential step in a number of tasks including systematic review preparation (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2015), construction of reference databases (Kleinstreuer et al., 2016), and knowledge discovery (Smalheiser, 2012).

Most often researchers/clinicians build their own intervention focusing on selected dimensions of health promotion for a specific population. This article recommends an alternative process of building health-promotion interventions for specific groups through the adaptation of content and processes of well-developed intervention frameworks with sound theoretical and empirical support. This efficient approach enhances the likelihood that new interventions will prove to be effective and enhance the quality of life for persons with chronic disabling conditions.

Yung"", ""Barnaby Nelson"", ""Kathryn Baker"", ""Joe A. Buckby"", ""Gennady Baksheev"", ""Elizabeth M. Cosgrave""]"	Objective: Studies conducted in community samples suggest that psychotic-like experiences are common in the general population, leading to suggestions that they are either variations of normal personality or are different expressions of underlying vulnerability to psychotic disorder. Different types of psychotic symptoms may exist, some being normal variants and some having implications for mental health and functioning. The aim of the present study was to determine if different subtypes of psychotic-like experiences could be identified in a community sample of adolescents and to investigate if particular subtypes were more likely to be associated with psychosocial difficulties, that is, distress, depression and poor functioning, than other subtypes. Method: Eight hundred and seventy-five Year 10 students from 34 schools participated in a cross-sectional survey that measured psychotic-like experiences using the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences; depression using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; and psychosocial functioning using the Revised Multidimensional Assessment of Functioning Scale. Factor analysis was conducted to identify any subtypes of psychotic experiences. Results: Four subtypes of psychotic-like experiences were identified: Bizarre Experiences, Perceptual Abnormalities, Persecutory Ideas, and Magical Thinking. Intermittent, infrequent psychotic experiences were common, but frequent experiences were not. Bizarre Experiences, Perceptual Abnormalities and Persecutory Ideas were strongly associated with distress, depression and poor functioning. Magical Thinking was only weakly associated with these variables. Overall these findings may suggest that infrequent psychotic-like experiences are unlikely to be a specific risk factor for onset of a psychotic disorder in community samples. Conclusions: Given that the different subtypes had varying associations with current difficulties it is suggested that not all subtypes confer the same risk for onset of psychotic disorder and poor outcome. Bizarre Experiences, Perceptual Abnormalities and Persecutory Ideas may represent expressions of underlying vulnerability to psychotic disorder, but Magical Thinking may be a normal personality variant.

Thomas Vanoutrive	Role of the built environment on mode choice decisions: additional evidence on the impact of density	"[""Cynthia Chen"", ""Hongmian Gong"", ""Robert Paaswell""]"	Density is a key component in the recent surge of mixed-use neighborhood developments. Empirical research has shown an inconsistent picture on the impact of density. In particular, it is unclear whether it is the density or the variables that go long with density that affect people's travel behavior. Many existing studies on density neglect confounding factors, for example, residential self-selection, generalized travel cost, accessibility, and access to transit stations. In addition, most still use a single trip as their observation unit, even though trip chaining is well recognized. The goal of this paper is to assess the role of density in affecting mode choice decisions in home-based work tours, while controlling for confounding factors. Using the dataset collected in the New York Metropolitan Region, we estimated a simultaneous two-equation system comprising two mutually interacting dependent variables: car ownership and the propensity to use auto. The results confirm the role of density after controlling for the confounding factors; in particular, employment density at work exerts more influence than residential density at home. The study also demonstrates the importance of using tour as the analysis unit in mode choice decisions. The study advances the field by analyzing the role of the built environment on home-based work tours. New knowledge is obtained in the relative contribution of density vs. a set of correlated factors, including generalized travel cost, accessibility, and access to transit stations.	In our model, parking seems thus a measure for agglomerations and density (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008).

Recent studies that reconstructed regulatory networks in mammalian cells have focused on short-term responses and relied on perturbation-based approaches that cannot be readily applied to primary T cells. Here, we combine transcriptional profiling at high temporal resolution, novel computational algorithms, and innovative nanowire-based tools for performing perturbations in primary T cells to systematically derive and experimentally validate a model of the dynamic regulatory network that controls Th17 differentiation. The network consists of two self-reinforcing, but mutually antagonistic, modules, with 12 novel regulators, whose coupled action may be essential for maintaining the balance between Th17 and other CD4+ T cell subsets.

CC2892	52040210	Governance costs in foreign direct investments: A MNC headquarters challenge	Gabriel Benito	Subsidiary roles and reverse knowledge transfer: An investigation of the effects of coordination mechanisms	"[""Larissa Rabbiosi""]"	In response to the increasing need to balance the pressures of global integration and local responsiveness, foreign subsidiaries must play a prominent role in the creation of knowledge that is valuable to the MNE as a whole. In this context, a key managerial problem relates to the balance between coordination mechanisms and knowledge flows from the subsidiary to the parent company, known as reverse knowledge transfer. It is crucial to understand the interdependencies between subsidiary roles and key coordination mechanisms, such as subsidiary autonomy, personal and electronic-based coordination mechanisms. This paper, therefore, offers new insights into the impact of coordination mechanisms on reverse knowledge transfer. On the basis of a data set consisting of 280 dyads between foreign subsidiaries and their parent companies, two distinctive configurations are found to positively affect the extent of reverse knowledge transfer. The first is the combination of a high degree of subsidiary autonomy and greater use of personal coordination mechanisms, and the second is the combination of low subsidiary autonomy and greater use of electronic-based coordination mechanisms. However, the relevance of these coordination configurations differs for various subsidiary roles.Reverse knowledge transfer Subsidiary roles Personal and electronic-based coordination mechanisms Subsidiary autonomy	To compensate for the differences, both formal and informal initiatives will often be introduced by the companies (Nohria and Ghoshal, 1994;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2011).

We report here clinical, pathological, bacteriological, and virological findings in 68 fatal American influenza/pneumonia military patients dying between May and October of 1918, a period that includes ~4 mo before the 1918 pandemic was recognized, and 2 mo (September-October 1918) during which it appeared and peaked. The lung tissues of 37 of these cases were positive for influenza viral antigens or viral RNA, including four from the prepandemic period (May-August). The prepandemic and pandemic peak cases were indistinguishable clinically and pathologically. All 68 cases had histological evidence of bacterial pneumonia, and 94% showed abundant bacteria on Gram stain. Sequence analysis of the viral hemagglutinin receptor-binding domain performed on RNA from 13 cases suggested a trend from a more ""avian-like"" viral receptor specificity with G222 in prepandemic cases to a more ""human-like"" specificity associated with D222 in pandemic peak cases. Viral antigen distribution in the respiratory tree, however, was not apparently different between prepandemic and pandemic peak cases, or between infections with viruses bearing different receptor-binding polymorphisms. The 1918 pandemic virus was circulating for at least 4 mo in the United States before it was recognized epidemiologically in September 1918.

In addition, the correlations of the number of social fears with these domains were studied.Data are from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS) (N = 7,076). Social phobia was assessed according to DSM-III-R with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI); quality of life was assessed according to the Short-Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36).The 12-month prevalence of social phobia was 4.8%. Being female, young, low educated, a single parent, living alone, not having a paid job and having a somatic disorder are associated with 12-month social phobia. Mean and median ages of onset of social phobia were 19.1 and 16.0 years, respectively, and mean and median duration were 16.8 and 14.0 years, respectively. 66% of respondents with social phobia had at least one comorbid condition. 12-month social phobia was significantly related to lower quality of life and higher service utilization. The mean number of feared social situations was 2.73 out of the 6 assessed. As the number of social fears increases, comorbidity and service utilization increases, and the quality of life decreases.These findings suggest as the number of feared social situations increases, the burden of social phobia rises. In other words, like comorbidity or decreased quality of life, the number of social fears is also an important indicator of the severity of social phobia.

Under suitable assumptions on f, we prove the existence and uniqueness of global solutions of the initial value problem in the Sobolev space H1( R n. The assumptions of f include continuous differentiability, the condition f(0) = 0 and suitable power bounds both at zero and at infinity. They cover the case of a single power f(u) = l | u | p - 1 u where 1  p (n + 2) (n - 2) if l  0 and 1  p (n + 4) n if l  0.

"[""William Dement"", ""Nathaniel Kleitman""]"	The study of dream activity and its relation to physiological variables during sleep necessitates a reliable method of determining with precision when dreaming occurs. This knowledge, in the final analysis, always depends upon the subjective report of the dreamer, but becomes relatively objective if such reports can be significantly related to some physiological phenomena which in turn can be measured by physical techniques. Such a relationship was reported by Aserinsky and Kleitman (1) who observed periods of rapid, conjugate eye movements during sleep and found a high incidence of dream recall in Ss awakened during these periods and a low incidence when awakened at other times.

CC377	82854584	Psychotherapy and brain plasticity	Daniel Collerton	Core processes of psychopathology and recovery	"[""Warren Mansell""]"	This editorial proposes that the task of identifying common processes across disorders and across psychotherapies will be the most fruitful way to develop efficient, easily trainable and coherent psychological interventions. The article adapts the concept of the ÔDodo Bird EffectÕ to argue for a mechanistic, testable account of functioning, akin to other unified approaches in science. The articles in the special issue complement this perspective in several ways: (1) three articles identify common processes across disorders within the domains of anger dysregulation, sleep disruption and perfectionism; (2) one article emphasises a case conceptualisation approach that is applied across different disorders and integrates theoretical approaches; (3) three articles focus on the utility of a control theory approach to understand the core processes of maintenance and change. Critically, there is a consensus that change involves facilitating the integration within the client's awareness of higher level, self-determined goals (e.g. insight; cognitive reappraisal) with their lower level regulation of present-moment experience (e.g. emotional openness; exposure). Taken together, these articles illustrate the benefits of a convergent rather than divergent approach to the science and practice of psychological therapy, and they strive to identify common ground across psychotherapies and across widely different presentations of psychopathology.	The outcomes of psychodynamic, personcentred, and behavioral psychotherapy are broadly equivalent despite their varieties of approaches and targets for therapeutic change (Stiles et al., 2008;Budd and Hughes, 2009) perhaps because they work via common final paths (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2011).

An Italy-Markal model was used to analyse the national energy-environment up to 2050. About 40 specific hydrogen technologies were considered, reproducing the main chains of production, transport and consumption, with a focus on transport applications. The analysis is based on the Baseline and Alternative scenario results, where hydrogen reaches a significant share. The two scenarios constitute the starting points to analyse the hydrogen potential among the possible energy policy options. The energy demand in the Baseline scenario reaches values around 240 Mtoe at 2030, with an average annual growth of 0.9%. The Alternative scenario reduces consumption down to 220 Mtoe and stabilizes the CO 2 emissions. The Alternative scenario expects a rapid increase of hydrogen vehicles in 2030, up to 2.5 million, corresponding to 1 Mtoe of hydrogen consumption. A sensitivity analysis shows that the results are rather robust.	Evidence from energy systems analysis suggests that the desirability of hydrogen as a decarbonisation option depends strongly on success in bringing down costs, for both fuel cell technologies and hydrogen production, delivery and storage systems [#AUTHOR_TAG,6,7].

CC875	81857737	From Implications to Dimensions: Science, Medicine and Ethics in Society	Martyn Pickersgill	Research, engagement and public bioethics: promoting socially robust science	"[""M. D. Pickersgill""]"	Citizens today are increasingly expected to be knowledgeable about and prepared to engage with biomedical knowledge. In this article, I wish to reframe this 'public understanding of science' project, and place fresh emphasis on public understandings of research: an engagement with the everyday laboratory practices of biomedicine and its associated ethics, rather than with specific scientific facts. This is not based on an assumption that non-scientists are 'ignorant' and are thus unable to 'appropriately' use or debate science; rather, it is underpinned by an empirically-grounded observation that some individuals may be unfamiliar with certain specificities of particular modes of research and ethical frameworks, and, as a consequence, have their autonomy compromised when invited to participate in biomedical investigations. Drawing on the perspectives of participants in my own sociological research on the social and ethical dimensions of neuroscience, I argue that public understanding of biomedical research and its ethics should be developed both at the community level and within the research moment itself in order to enhance autonomy and promote more socially robust science. Public bioethics will have to play a key role in such an endeavour, and indeed will contribute in important ways to the opening up of new spaces of symmetrical engagement between bioethicists, scientists and wider publics-and hence to the democratisation of the bioethical enterprise.	In so doing, opportunities for more democratic forms of bioethical deliberation are also restricted #AUTHOR_TAG.	"['The attention of STS to lived experience may also widen the bioethical gaze in regards to public engagement.', 'Activities in this vein are often used as fora within which to educate non-scientists about biomedical developments whilst also promoting wider discussion of their social and ethical aspects.', 'Yet, often an expert-lay divide is perpetuated which closes down opportunities for more reflexive debate [35].', ""Accordingly, the fresh perspectives that might be gleaned from public participants and which might have salience to bioethicists are 'framed out'."", 'In so doing, opportunities for more democratic forms of bioethical deliberation are also restricted #AUTHOR_TAG.', ""As STS scholars have shown, publics can be both knowledgeable about biomedicine and willing to engage in sustained debate and analysis about issues that bioethicists are grappling with [34,56]; limiting participation is thus unfortunate not only for democractic reasons, but also because potentially 'useful' contributions from those outside the academiy remain unheard."", 'However, some investigators working within bioethics are drawing on STS research and explicitly seeking to enrol wider publics into ethical analysis (e.g.', '[41,63]).', 'Such work has the potential to enrich both STS studies of expertise and deliberation, and bioethical frameworks for thinking about the impacts and acceptable limits of biomedical innovation.']"	3	"['In so doing, opportunities for more democratic forms of bioethical deliberation are also restricted #AUTHOR_TAG.', ""As STS scholars have shown, publics can be both knowledgeable about biomedicine and willing to engage in sustained debate and analysis about issues that bioethicists are grappling with [34,56]; limiting participation is thus unfortunate not only for democractic reasons, but also because potentially 'useful' contributions from those outside the academiy remain unheard."", 'However, some investigators working within bioethics are drawing on STS research and explicitly seeking to enrol wider publics into ethical analysis (e.g.']"

J. Fowler"", ""C. G. Kilsby""]"	Multi-day rainfall events are an important cause of recent severe flooding in the UK and any change in  the magnitude of such events may have severe impacts upon urban structures such as dams, urban  drainage systems and flood defences and cause failures to occur. Regional pooling of 1-, 2-, 5- and 10- day annual maxima for 1961 to 2000 from 204 sites across the UK is used in a standard regional  frequency analysis to produce GEV growth curves for long return-period rainfall events for each of nine  defined climatological regions. Temporal changes in 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-day annual maxima are examined  with L-moments using both a 10-year moving window and fixed decades from 1961-70, 1971-80, 1981- 90 and 1991-2000. A bootstrap technique is then used to assess uncertainty in the fitted decadal growth  curves and to identify significant trends in both distribution parameters and quantile estimates.    There has been a two-part change in extreme rainfall event occurrence across the UK from 1961-2000.  Little change is observed at 1- and 2-day duration, but significant decadal level changes are seen in 5- and  10-day events in many regions. In the south of the UK, growth curves have flattened and 5- and 10-day  annual maxima have decreased during the 1990s. However, in the north, the 10-day growth curve has  steepened and annual maxima have risen during the 1990s. This is particularly evident in Scotland. The  50-year event in Scotland during 1961-1990 has become an 8-, 11- and 25-year event in the Eastern,  Southern and Northern Scotland pooling regions respectively during the 1990s. In northern England the  average recurrence interval has also halved. This may have severe implications for design and planning  practices in flood control.	#AUTHOR_TAG and Kilsby (2003) demonstrated that multi-day precipitation is an important causal factor in floods, and found no significant changes in 1-2 day precipitation in the period 1991-2000 compared to earlier decades but significant changes in 5-day events.

The present study examines this process for learning multiple words, testing the hypothesis that children's attention to the information critical for quickly mapping multiple words onto their referents depends on the alternatives available when the words are introduced. Fifty-eight 40-month-old children participated in one of two conditions. In both conditions, each trial for novel Word #1 presented a novel object and three familiar ones. The conditions differed in the object choices presented when novel Word #2 was introduced. Although the same information was available to children in both conditions, younger children showed significantly better learning of the new words in the successive condition than in the concurrent condition. Implications of this for age-related differences and for teaching strategies are discussed."

Our purpose in this paper is to shed new light on economic geography through the lenses of these two fields of economics and regional science.

CC2264	81800077	Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	Fabio Reale	A loop model of active coronal regions	"[""M Landini"", ""B C Monsignori Fossi""]"	The energy balance which is established in a vertical cylinder of constant pressure between the radiated energy, the energy supplied from below and dissipated over one typical scale height 1/k, and the energy flux conducted along the temperature gradient is investigated. A model of temperature versus height is obtained. The emission measure versus temperature distribution is evaluated and compared with observation. A coronal active region is simulated by assembling a large number of such tubes shaped along the lines of force of a dipole field assuming that the flux of the supplied energy is proportional to the magnetic field intensity. Comparison is made with experimental data on several X-ray emission lines.

CC2054	82854048	Episodic eolian sand deposition in the past 4000 years in Cape Cod National Seashore, Massachusetts, USA in response to possible hurricane/storm and anthropogenic disturbances	Steven Forman	Mineralogy and provenance of Pleistocene outwash-plain and modern beach sands of outer Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA	"[""C Ockay"", ""J F Hubert""]"	Sand and pebbles of the beaches of outer Cape Cod are derived from eroding coastal cliffs of lacustrine-fluvial outwash plains of Wisconsin age. The beach sands and the sands of the older and younger Wellfleet, Highland and Truro plains have similar mineralogically mature, quartzose compositions. These sands are quartz-arenites to subarkoses with small amounts of glauconite pellets. The complete samples of the combined outwash and beach groups average 89% quartz and 4% feldspar; the medium-sand fractions average 91% quartz and 5% feldspar. The non-opaque, non-micaceous heavy minerals in the medium-sand fraction of the beaches average 42% tourmaline, 16% staurolite, 14% garnet, 13% sillimanite, 5% amphibole, 5% andalusite, and 5% others. Although the proportions of heavy minerals in the outwash sands vary among samples, the average composition is similar to the beach sands: 40% tourmaline, 16% staurolite, 16% sillimanite, 12% garnet, 6% andalusite, 4% amphibole, and 6% others. A common provenance for outwash and beach sands is also reflected in the nearly uniform ratios of color varieties of tourmaline in all samples. Most of the quartzose sand of the beaches and outwash has a long history of recycling from Atlantic coastal-plain strata of Cretaceous to Tertiary age. These sands were entrained by Illinoian (?) glacial ice, which deposited gravel and sand in till and outwash over the Gulf of Maine. Sangamon marine reworking of the surface of these deposits mantled them with glauconitic, quartzose sand and gravel. Wisconsin ice moved southeastward, stripping the floor of the Gulf of Maine down to crystalline rocks and remnants of Cretaceous to Tertiary strata. Melt-water streams flowed southwestward from the South Channel Lobe into lakes, building the outwash plains with quartzose sand and lithic pebbles. The shapes and surfaces of many round, subspherical quartz grains were modified by grinding during transport in the ice, producing conchoidal fractures, flat-edged plate-like fragments, sharp edges, sliver-like chips, and grooves. Subsequent longshore transport of the quartzose sand and lithic pebbles north and south from a nodal zone has somewhat rounded the grains, but has not made the medium-sand fraction more quartzose. The nodal zone is northeast of Wellfleet, as evidenced by an increase in hydraulic equivalent ratios for tourmaline, sillimanite, staurolite, garnet and hornblende north and south along the coast from this location.	The sands analyzed have a SiO content of >90% of the noncarbonate fraction and are predominantly a moderately to well sorted medium to coarse sand with >80% quartz grains, reflecting the mineralogy of underlying Pleistocene outwash, a likely source for the eolian sand (#AUTHOR_TAG and Hubert, 1996).

CC32	211273841	Co-designing Cards on Social Issues for Creating Educational Games	Christina Myers	The glass ceiling in the 21st century: Understanding barriers to gender equality.	"[""M Barreto"", ""M Ryan"", ""M Schmitt""]"	Since the term 'glass ceiling' was first coined in 1984, women have made great progress in terms of leadership equality with men in the workplace. Despite this, women are still under-represented in the upper echelons of organizations.In this volume, leading psychologists from the United States, Canada, and the European Union go beyond social commentary, anecdotal evidence and raw statistics to explain and offer remedies for this continued inequality, based on empirical evidence. Subtle barriers to women's advancement to and success in leadership positions are a major focus, such as women being recruited for upper-level positions that are associated with a high risk of failure or women managers being stereotyped as either competent or warm (but not both). Solutions that can be practically implemented are offered at different levels of analysis, including organizational (e.g., affirmative action), work group (e.g., diversity management), and individual (e.g., cross-cultural networking).Other obstacles associated with breaking through the glass ceiling include more nuanced forms of gender stereotyping, tokenism, and sexual harassment. The somewhat surprising effects of affirmative action and family friendly policies are also examined. As this volume explores women's current experiences in the workplace, a critical emphasis is making visible what women encounter as their career trajectory ascends and suggesting how they can enhance their career choices and thrive in the hard-won positions they attain.

CC1002	11277201	Methodology and Campaign Design for the Evaluation of Semantic Search Tools	Stuart Wrigley	Towards a theory of natural language interfaces to databases	"[""Ana-Maria Popescu"", ""Oren Etzioni"", ""Henry Kautz""]"	"The need for Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) to databases has become increasingly acute as more nontechnical people access information through their web browsers, PDAs and cell phones. Yet NLIs are only usable if they map natural language questions to SQL queries correctly. We introduce the Precise NLI [2], which reduces the semantic interpretation challenge in NLIs to a graph matching problem. Precise uses the max-flow algorithm to efficiently solve this problem. Each max-flow solution corresponds to a possible semantic interpretation of the sentence. precise collects max-flow solutions, discards the solutions that do not obey syntactic constraints and retains the rest as the basis for generating SQL queries corresponding to the question q. The syntactic information is extracted from the parse tree corresponding to the given question which is computed by a statistical parser [1]. For a broad, well-defined class of semantically tractable natural language questions, Precise is guaranteed to map each question to the corresponding SQL querySemantically tractable questions correspond to a natural, domain-independent subset of English that can be efficiently and accurately interpreted as nonrecursive Datalog clauses. Precise is transportable to arbitrary databases, such as the Restaurants,Jobs and Geography databases used in our implementation. Examples of semantically tractable questions include: ""What Chinese restaurants with a 3.5 rating are in Seattle?"", ""What are the areas of US states with large populations?"", ""What jobs require 4 years of experience and desire a B.S.CS degree?"".Given a question which is not semantically tractable, Precise recognizes it as such and informs the user that it cannot answer it.Given a semantically tractable question, Precise computes the set of non-equivalent SQL interpretations corresponding to the question. If a unique such SQL interpretation exists, Precise outputs it together with the corresponding result set obtained by querying the current database. If the set contains more than one SQL interpretation, the natural language question is ambiguous in the context of the current database. In this case, Precise asks for the user's help in determining which interpretation is the correct one.Our experiments have shown that Precise has high coverage and accuracy over common English questions. In future work, we plan to explore increasingly broad classes of questions and include Precise as a module in a full-fledged dialog system. An important direction for future work is helping users understand the types of questions Precise cannot handle via dialog, enabling them to build an accurate mental model of the system and its capabilities. Also, our own group's work on the EXACT natural language interface [3] builds on Precise and on the underlying theoretical framework. EXACT composes an extended version of Precise with a sound and complete planner to develop a powerful and provably reliable interface to household appliances"	Furthermore, its use allowed the possibility of making the findings comparable with other evaluations of tools in this area, such as Cocktail [18], PANTO #AUTHOR_TAG and PRECISE #AUTHOR_TAG.
