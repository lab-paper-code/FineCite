Many other such cases are described in Danlos 's book ( #AUTHOR_TAG )  . The common theme behind many of these examples is that pipelines have difficulties satisfying linguistic constraints (such as unambiguous reference) or performing linguistic optimizations (such as using pronouns instead of longer referring expressions whenever possible) in cases where the constraints or optimizations depend on decisions made in multiple modules. This is largely due to the fact that pipelined systems cannot perform general search over a decision space that includes decisions made in more than one module.,0
