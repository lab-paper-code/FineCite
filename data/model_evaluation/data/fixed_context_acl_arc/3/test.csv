The knowledge sources are cast as filters, so that any subset of them can be cascaded in a uniform framework. A new objective evaluation measure is used to compare the quality of lexicons induced with different filter cascades. The best filter cascades improve lexicon quality by up to 137% over the plain vanilla statistical method, and approach human performance. Drastically reducing the size of the training corpus has a much smaller impact on lexicon quality when these knowledge sources are used. This makes it practical to train on small hand-built corpora for language pairs where large bilingual corpora are unavailable. Moreover, three of the four filters prove useful even when used with large training corpora.","With the exception of ( Fung , 1995b ) , previous methods for automatically constructing statistical translation models begin by looking at word cooccurrence frequencies in bitexts ( Gale & Church , 1991 ; Kumano & Hirakawa , 1994 ; Fung , 1995a ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .","['With the exception of ( Fung , 1995b ) , previous methods for automatically constructing statistical translation models begin by looking at word cooccurrence frequencies in bitexts ( Gale & Church , 1991 ; Kumano & Hirakawa , 1994 ; Fung , 1995a ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'A bitext comprises a pair of texts in two languages, where each text is a translation of the other.', 'Word co-occurrence can be defined in various ways.', 'The most common way is to divide each half of the bitext into an equal number of segments and to align the segments so that each pair of segments Si and Ti are translations of each other (Gale & Church, 1991; Melamed, 1996a).', 'Then, two word tokens (u, v) are said to co-occur in the aligned segment pair i if u E Si and v E Ti.', 'The co-occurrence relation can also be based on distance in a bitext space, which is a more general representations of bitext correspondence (Dagan et al., 1993; Resnik & Melamed, 1997), or it can be restricted to words pairs that satisfy some matching predicate, which can be extrinsic to the model (Melamed, 1995; Melamed, 1997).']",0,"['Even better accuracy can be achieved with a more fine-grained link class structure.', 'Promising features for classification include part of speech , frequency of co-occurrence , relative word position , and translational entropy ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['Promising features for classification include part of speech , frequency of co-occurrence , relative word position , and translational entropy ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'Another interesting extension is to broaden the definition of a ""word"" to include multi-word lexical units (Smadja, 1992).']","['Even better accuracy can be achieved with a more fine-grained link class structure.', 'Promising features for classification include part of speech , frequency of co-occurrence , relative word position , and translational entropy ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['Even better accuracy can be achieved with a more fine-grained link class structure.', 'Promising features for classification include part of speech , frequency of co-occurrence , relative word position , and translational entropy ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['Promising features for classification include part of speech , frequency of co-occurrence , relative word position , and translational entropy ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'Another interesting extension is to broaden the definition of a ""word"" to include multi-word lexical units (Smadja, 1992).', 'If such units can be identified a priori, their translations can be estimated without modifying the word-to-word model.']","['Even better accuracy can be achieved with a more fine-grained link class structure.', 'Promising features for classification include part of speech , frequency of co-occurrence , relative word position , and translational entropy ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'Another interesting extension is to broaden the definition of a ""word"" to include multi-word lexical units (Smadja, 1992).']","['Even better accuracy can be achieved with a more fine-grained link class structure.', 'Promising features for classification include part of speech , frequency of co-occurrence , relative word position , and translational entropy ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'Another interesting extension is to broaden the definition of a ""word"" to include multi-word lexical units (Smadja, 1992).', 'If such units can be identified a priori, their translations can be estimated without modifying the word-to-word model.']","['Even better accuracy can be achieved with a more fine-grained link class structure.', 'Promising features for classification include part of speech , frequency of co-occurrence , relative word position , and translational entropy ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['Promising features for classification include part of speech , frequency of co-occurrence , relative word position , and translational entropy ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'Another interesting extension is to broaden the definition of a ""word"" to include multi-word lexical units (Smadja, 1992).', 'If such units can be identified a priori, their translations can be estimated without modifying the word-to-word model.', 'In this manner, the model can account for a wider range of translation phenomena.']"
CC1178,P97-1063,A word-to-word model of translational equivalence,building probabilistic models for natural language,['S Chen'],method,"Building models of language is a central task in natural language processing. Traditionally, language has been modeled with manually-constructed grammars that describe which strings are grammatical and which are not; however, with the recent availability of massive amounts of on-line text, statistically-trained models are an attractive alternative. These models are generally probabilistic, yielding a score reflecting sentence frequency instead of a binary grammaticality judgement. Probabilistic models of language are a fundamental tool in speech recognition for resolving acoustically ambiguous utterances. For example, we prefer the transcription forbear to four bear as the former string is far more frequent in English text. Probabilistic models also have application in optical character recognition, handwriting recognition, spelling correction, part-of-speech tagging, and machine translation. In this thesis, we investigate three problems involving the probabilistic modeling of language: smoothing n-gram models, statistical grammar induction, and bilingual sentence alignment. These three problems employ models at three different levels of language; they involve word-based, constituent-based, and sentence-based models, respectively. We describe techniques for improving the modeling of language at each of these levels, and surpass the performance of existing algorithms for each problem. We approach the three problems using three different frameworks. We relate each of these frameworks to the Bayesian paradigm, and show why each framework used was appropriate for the given problem. Finally, we show how our research addresses two central issues in probabilistic modeling: the sparse data problem and the problem of inducing hidden structure.Engineering and Applied Science","It is analogous to the step in other translation model induction algorithms that sets all probabilities below a certain threshold to negligible values ( Brown et al. , 1990 ; Dagan et al. , 1993 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .","['1.

CC1185,P97-1063,A word-to-word model of translational equivalence,building probabilistic models for natural language,['S Chen'],,"Building models of language is a central task in natural language processing. Traditionally, language has been modeled with manually-constructed grammars that describe which strings are grammatical and which are not; however, with the recent availability of massive amounts of on-line text, statistically-trained models are an attractive alternative. These models are generally probabilistic, yielding a score reflecting sentence frequency instead of a binary grammaticality judgement. Probabilistic models of language are a fundamental tool in speech recognition for resolving acoustically ambiguous utterances. For example, we prefer the transcription forbear to four bear as the former string is far more frequent in English text. Probabilistic models also have application in optical character recognition, handwriting recognition, spelling correction, part-of-speech tagging, and machine translation. In this thesis, we investigate three problems involving the probabilistic modeling of language: smoothing n-gram models, statistical grammar induction, and bilingual sentence alignment. These three problems employ models at three different levels of language; they involve word-based, constituent-based, and sentence-based models, respectively. We describe techniques for improving the modeling of language at each of these levels, and surpass the performance of existing algorithms for each problem. We approach the three problems using three different frameworks. We relate each of these frameworks to the Bayesian paradigm, and show why each framework used was appropriate for the given problem. Finally, we show how our research addresses two central issues in probabilistic modeling: the sparse data problem and the problem of inducing hidden structure.Engineering and Applied Science","This imbalance foils thresholding strategies , clever as they might be ( Gale & Church , 1991 ; Wu & Xia , 1994 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .","['Though some have tried, it is not clear how to extract such accurate lexicons from other published translation models.', 'Part of the difficulty stems from the implicit assumption in other models that each word has only one sense.', 'Each word is assigned the same unit of probability mass, which the model distributes over all candidate translations.', 'The correct translations of a word that has several correct translations will be assigned a lower probability than the correct translation of a word that has only one correct translation.', 'This imbalance foils thresholding strategies , clever as they might be ( Gale & Church , 1991 ; Wu & Xia , 1994 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'The likelihoods in the word-to-word model remain unnormalized, so they do not compete.']",0,"['We only use one sample to extract the translation grammar because multiple samples would result in a grammar that would be too large. 11', '11 From ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , we find that the performance of SAMT system is similar with the method of labeling SCFG rules with POS tags .']","['11 From ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , we find that the performance of SAMT system is similar with the method of labeling SCFG rules with POS tags .', 'Thus, to be convenient, we only conduct experiments with the SAMT system.']","['We only use one sample to extract the translation grammar because multiple samples would result in a grammar that would be too large. 11', '11 From ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , we find that the performance of SAMT system is similar with the method of labeling SCFG rules with POS tags .', 'Thus, to be convenient, we only conduct experiments with the SAMT system.']","['We built an s2t translation system with the achieved U-trees after the 1000th iteration.', 'We only use one sample to extract the translation grammar because multiple samples would result in a grammar that would be too large. 11', '11 From ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , we find that the performance of SAMT system is similar with the method of labeling SCFG rules with POS tags .']","['11 From ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , we find that the performance of SAMT system is similar with the method of labeling SCFG rules with POS tags .', 'Thus, to be convenient, we only conduct experiments with the SAMT system.']","['We built an s2t translation system with the achieved U-trees after the 1000th iteration.', 'We only use one sample to extract the translation grammar because multiple samples would result in a grammar that would be too large. 11', '11 From ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , we find that the performance of SAMT system is similar with the method of labeling SCFG rules with POS tags .', 'Thus, to be convenient, we only conduct experiments with the SAMT system.']","['We only use one sample to extract the translation grammar because multiple samples would result in a grammar that would be too large. 11', '11 From ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , we find that the performance of SAMT system is similar with the method of labeling SCFG rules with POS tags .', 'Thus, to be convenient, we only conduct experiments with the SAMT system.']","['For the hyperparameters, we set I to 0.1 and p expand = 1/3 to give a preference to the rules with small fragments.', 'We built an s2t translation system with the achieved U-trees after the 1000th iteration.', 'We only use one sample to extract the translation grammar because multiple samples would result in a grammar that would be too large. 11', '11 From ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , we find that the performance of SAMT system is similar with the method of labeling SCFG rules with POS tags .']","['11 From ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , we find that the performance of SAMT system is similar with the method of labeling SCFG rules with POS tags .', 'Thus, to be convenient, we only conduct experiments with the SAMT system.']"

We use a target language parser to generate parse trees for each sentence on the target side of the bilingual training corpus, matching them with phrase table lattices built for the corresponding source sentence.

In a dialogue, exchanges between participants promote the establishment of shared information and this leads to e ortless communication. This is called  dialogue coordination"". In particular, revealing the respondent's internal state, such as through nodding and back-channel feedback, promotes the establishment of shared information. This is called  manifestation"", which is one aspect of coordinative behavior, and a mechanism for handling manifestation is introduced. In a human-human dialogue, the listener's manifestative behavior often occurs during a speaker's utterance. However, systems using conventional speech recognition technologies cannot respond during the speaker's utterance. In order to solve this problem, the proposed mechanism, ISTAR protocol transmission, utilizes the intermediate speech recognition results without waiting for the end of the speaker's utterance. This realizes a system with exible manifestative behavior.","This recognizer incrementally outputs word hypotheses as soon as they are found in the best-scored path in the forward search ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) using the ISTAR ( Incremental Structure Transmitter And Receiver ) protocol , which conveys word graph information as well as word hypotheses .","['word hypotheses.', 'As the recogn/fion engine, either VoiceRex, developed by NTI"" (Noda et al., 1998), or HTK from Entropic Research can be used.', 'Acoustic models for HTK is trained with the continuous speech database of the Acoustical Society of Japan (Kobayashi et al., 1992).', 'This recognizer incrementally outputs word hypotheses as soon as they are found in the best-scored path in the forward search ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) using the ISTAR ( Incremental Structure Transmitter And Receiver ) protocol , which conveys word graph information as well as word hypotheses .', 'This incremental output allows the language understanding module to process recognition results before the speech interval ends, and thus real-time responses are possible.', 'This module continuously runs and outputs recognition results when it detects a speech interval.', 'This enables the language generation module to react immediately to user interruptions while the system is speaking.', 'The language model for speech recognition is a network (regular) grammar, and it allows each speech interval to be an arbitrary number of phrases.', 'A phrase is a sequence of words, which is to be defined in a domain-dependent way.', 'Sentences can be decomposed into a couple of phrases.', 'The reason we use a repetition of phrases instead of a sentence grammar for the language model is that the speech recognition module of a robust spoken dialogue system sometimes has to recognize spontaneously spoken utterances, which include self-repairs and repetition.', 'In Japanese, bunsetsu is appropriate for defining phrases.', 'A bunsetsu consists of one content word and a number (possibly zero) of function words.', 'In the meeting room reservation system we have developed, examples of defined phrases are bunsetsu to specify the room to be reserved and the time of the reservation and bunsetsu to express affirmation and negation.']",0,"['Functions defined here decide what string should be spoken and send that string to the speech output module based on the current dialogue state.', 'They can also shift the dialogue 2The notion of the initiative in this paper is different from that of the dialogue initiative of #AUTHOR_TAG .']",['They can also shift the dialogue 2The notion of the initiative in this paper is different from that of the dialogue initiative of #AUTHOR_TAG .'],"['Functions defined here decide what string should be spoken and send that string to the speech output module based on the current dialogue state.', 'They can also shift the dialogue 2The notion of the initiative in this paper is different from that of the dialogue initiative of #AUTHOR_TAG .']","['Functions defined here decide what string should be spoken and send that string to the speech output module based on the current dialogue state.', 'They can also shift the dialogue 2The notion of the initiative in this paper is different from that of the dialogue initiative of #AUTHOR_TAG .']",['They can also shift the dialogue 2The notion of the initiative in this paper is different from that of the dialogue initiative of #AUTHOR_TAG .'],"['Functions defined here decide what string should be spoken and send that string to the speech output module based on the current dialogue state.', 'They can also shift the dialogue 2The notion of the initiative in this paper is different from that of the dialogue initiative of #AUTHOR_TAG .']","['Functions defined here decide what string should be spoken and send that string to the speech output module based on the current dialogue state.', 'They can also shift the dialogue 2The notion of the initiative in this paper is different from that of the dialogue initiative of #AUTHOR_TAG .']","['Functions defined here decide what string should be spoken and send that string to the speech output module based on the current dialogue state.', 'They can also shift the dialogue 2The notion of the initiative in this paper is different from that of the dialogue initiative of #AUTHOR_TAG .']",['They can also shift the dialogue 2The notion of the initiative in this paper is different from that of the dialogue initiative of #AUTHOR_TAG .']

Our expectation is that the ability to predict problematic dialogues will allow the system's dialogue manager to modify its behavior to repair problems, and even perhaps, to prevent them. We train a problematic dialogue classifier using automatically-obtainable features that can identify problematic dialogues significantly better (23%) than the baseline. A classifier trained with only automatic features from the first exchange in the dialogue can predict problematic dialogues 7% more accurately than the baseline, and one trained with automatic features from the first two exchanges can perform 14% better than the baseline.","The recent great advances in speech and language technologies have made it possible to build fully implemented spoken dialogue systems ( Aust et al. , 1995 ; Allen et al. , 1996 ; Zue et al. , 2000 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .","['The recent great advances in speech and language technologies have made it possible to build fully implemented spoken dialogue systems ( Aust et al. , 1995 ; Allen et al. , 1996 ; Zue et al. , 2000 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'One of the next research goals is to make these systems task-portable, that is, to simplify the process of porting to another task domain.']",0,"['The recent great advances in speech and language technologies have made it possible to build fully implemented spoken dialogue systems ( Aust et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Zue et al. , 2000 ; Walker et al. , 2000 ) .']","['The recent great advances in speech and language technologies have made it possible to build fully implemented spoken dialogue systems ( Aust et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Zue et al. , 2000 ; Walker et al. , 2000 ) .', 'One of the next research goals is to make these systems task-portable, that is, to simplify the process of porting to another task domain.']","['The recent great advances in speech and language technologies have made it possible to build fully implemented spoken dialogue systems ( Aust et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Zue et al. , 2000 ; Walker et al. , 2000 ) .', 'One of the next research goals is to make these systems task-portable, that is, to simplify the process of porting to another task domain.']","['The recent great advances in speech and language technologies have made it possible to build fully implemented spoken dialogue systems ( Aust et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Zue et al. , 2000 ; Walker et al. , 2000 ) .']","['The recent great advances in speech and language technologies have made it possible to build fully implemented spoken dialogue systems ( Aust et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Zue et al. , 2000 ; Walker et al. , 2000 ) .', 'One of the next research goals is to make these systems task-portable, that is, to simplify the process of porting to another task domain.']","['The recent great advances in speech and language technologies have made it possible to build fully implemented spoken dialogue systems ( Aust et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Zue et al. , 2000 ; Walker et al. , 2000 ) .', 'One of the next research goals is to make these systems task-portable, that is, to simplify the process of porting to another task domain.']","['The recent great advances in speech and language technologies have made it possible to build fully implemented spoken dialogue systems ( Aust et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Zue et al. , 2000 ; Walker et al. , 2000 ) .', 'One of the next research goals is to make these systems task-portable, that is, to simplify the process of porting to another task domain.']","['The recent great advances in speech and language technologies have made it possible to build fully implemented spoken dialogue systems ( Aust et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Zue et al. , 2000 ; Walker et al. , 2000 ) .']","['The recent great advances in speech and language technologies have made it possible to build fully implemented spoken dialogue systems ( Aust et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Zue et al. , 2000 ; Walker et al. , 2000 ) .', 'One of the next research goals is to make these systems task-portable, that is, to simplify the process of porting to another task domain.']"

CC1231,W00-1017,WIT,a grammar and a parser for spontaneous speech,"['Mikio Nakano', 'Akira Shimazu', 'Kiyoshi Kogure']",conclusion,"This paper classifies distinctive phenomena occurring in Japanese spontaneous speech, and proposes a grammar and processing techniques for handling them. Parsers using a grammar for written sentences cannot deal with spontaneous speech because in spontaneous speech there are phenomena that do not occur in written sentences. A grammar based on analysis of transcripts of dialogues was therefore developed. It has two distinctive features: it uses short units as input units instead of using sentences in grammars for written sentences, and it covers utterances including phrases peculiar to spontaneous speech. Since the grammar is an augmentation of a grammar for written sentences, it can also be used to analyze complex utterances.

Although a confirmation dialogue is unavoidable, it should be as concise as possible.

The result is unnecessarily long dialogues to confirm a user's request minutely even if the request is beyond the system's knowledge.

Acquisition and representation of translation knowledge plays a central role in this process. This paper explores the utility of two sources of translation knowledge for cross-language retrieval. We have implemented six query translation techniques that use bilingual term lists and one based on direct use of the translation output from an existing machine translation system; these are compared with a document translation technique that uses output from the same machine translation system. Average precision measures on a TREC collection suggest that arbitrarily selecting a single dictionary translation is typically no less effective than using every translation in the dictionary, that query translation using a machine translation system can achieve somewhat better effectiveness than simpler techniques, and that document translation may result in further improvements in retrieval effectiveness under some conditions.","One common approach is using Machine Translation ( MT ) to translate the queries to the language of the documents or translate documents to the language of the queries ( Gey et al , 1999 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .","['Many approaches to cross-lingual IR have been published.', 'One common approach is using Machine Translation ( MT ) to translate the queries to the language of the documents or translate documents to the language of the queries ( Gey et al , 1999 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'For most languages, there are no MT systems at all.', 'Our focus is on languages where no MT exists, but a bilingual dictionary may exist or may be derived.']",1,"['Each English word has around 1.5 translations on average.', 'A cooccurrence based stemmer ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) was used to stem Spanish words .']","['A cooccurrence based stemmer ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) was used to stem Spanish words .', 'One difference from the treatment of Chinese is to include the English word as one of its own translations in addition to its Spanish translations in the lexicon.']","['Each English word has around 1.5 translations on average.', 'A cooccurrence based stemmer ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) was used to stem Spanish words .', 'One difference from the treatment of Chinese is to include the English word as one of its own translations in addition to its Spanish translations in the lexicon.']","['containing around 22,000 English words (16,000 English stems) and processed it similarly.', 'Each English word has around 1.5 translations on average.', 'A cooccurrence based stemmer ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) was used to stem Spanish words .']","['A cooccurrence based stemmer ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) was used to stem Spanish words .', 'One difference from the treatment of Chinese is to include the English word as one of its own translations in addition to its Spanish translations in the lexicon.', 'This is useful for translating proper nouns, which often have identical spellings in English and Spanish but are routinely excluded from a lexicon.']","['containing around 22,000 English words (16,000 English stems) and processed it similarly.', 'Each English word has around 1.5 translations on average.', 'A cooccurrence based stemmer ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) was used to stem Spanish words .', 'One difference from the treatment of Chinese is to include the English word as one of its own translations in addition to its Spanish translations in the lexicon.']","['Each English word has around 1.5 translations on average.', 'A cooccurrence based stemmer ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) was used to stem Spanish words .', 'One difference from the treatment of Chinese is to include the English word as one of its own translations in addition to its Spanish translations in the lexicon.', 'This is useful for translating proper nouns, which often have identical spellings in English and Spanish but are routinely excluded from a lexicon.']","['For Spanish, we downloaded a bilingual English-Spanish lexicon from the Internet (http://www.activa.arrakis.es)', 'containing around 22,000 English words (16,000 English stems) and processed it similarly.', 'Each English word has around 1.5 translations on average.', 'A cooccurrence based stemmer ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) was used to stem Spanish words .']","['A cooccurrence based stemmer ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) was used to stem Spanish words .', 'One difference from the treatment of Chinese is to include the English word as one of its own translations in addition to its Spanish translations in the lexicon.', 'This is useful for translating proper nouns, which often have identical spellings in English and Spanish but are routinely excluded from a lexicon.']"

CC1264,W01-0706,Exploring evidence for shallow parsing,parsing by chunks,['S P Abney'],introduction,"I begin with an intuition: when I read a sentence, I read it a chunk at a time. For example, the previous sentence breaks up something like this:    (1)    [I begin] [with an intuition]: [when I read] [a sentence], [I read it] [a chunk] [at a time]              These chunks correspond in some way to prosodic patterns. It appears, for instance, that the strongest stresses in the sentence fall one to a chunk, and pauses are most likely to fall between chunks. Chunks also represent a grammatical watershed of sorts. The typical chunk consists of a single content word surrounded by a constellation of function words, matching a fixed template. A simple context-free grammar is quite adequate to describe the structure of chunks. By contrast, the relationships between chunks are mediated more by lexical selection than by rigid templates. Co-occurrence of chunks is determined not just by their syntactic categories, but is sensitive to the precise words that head them; and the order in which chunks occur is much more flexible than the order of words within chunks.","Rather than producing a complete analysis of sentences , the alternative is to perform only partial analysis of the syntactic structures in a text ( Harris , 1957 ;

CC1265,W01-0706,Exploring evidence for shallow parsing,evaluation techniques for automatic semantic extraction comparing semantic and window based approaches,['G Greffenstette'],introduction,"As large on-line corpora become more prevalent, a number of attempts have been made to automatically extract thesaurus-like relations directly from text using knowledge poor methods. In the absence of any specific application, comparing the results of these attempts is difficult. Here we propose an evaluation method using gold standards, i.e., pre-existing hand-compiled resources, as a means of comparing extraction techniques. Using this evaluation method, we compare two semantic extraction techniques which produce similar word lists, one using syntactic context of words , and the other using windows of heuristically tagged words. The two techniques are very similar except that in one case selective natural language processing, a partial syntactic analysis, is performed. On a 4 megabyte corpus, syntactic contexts produce significantly better results against the gold standards for the most characteristk: words in the corpus, while windows produce better results for rare words.","Rather than producing a complete analysis of sentences , the alternative is to perform only partial analysis of the syntactic structures in a text ( Harris , 1957 ;

CC1269,W01-0706,Exploring evidence for shallow parsing,a linear observed time statistical parser based on maximum entropy models,['A Ratnaparkhi'],introduction,"This paper presents a statistical parser for natural language that obtains a parsing accuracy---roughly 87% precision and 86% recall---which surpasses the best previously published results on the Wall St. Journal domain. The parser itself requires very little human intervention, since the information it uses to make parsing decisions is specified in a concise and simple manner, and is combined in a fully automatic way under the maximum entropy framework. The observed running time of the parser on a test sentence is linear with respect to the sentence length. Furthermore, the parser returns several scored parses for a sentence, and this paper shows that a scheme to pick the best parse from the 20 highest scoring parses could yield a dramatically higher accuracy of 93% precision and recall.","However , since work in this direction has started , a significant progress has also been made in the research on statistical learning of full parsers , both in terms of accuracy and processing time ( Charniak , 1997b ;

This same method can be applied at a higher level of textual interpretation for locating chunks in the tagged text, including non-recursive ""baseNP"" chunks. For this purpose, it is convenient to view chunking as a tagging problem by encoding the chunk structure in new tags attached to each word. In automatic tests using Treebank-derived data, this technique achieved recall and precision rates of roughly 93% for baseNP chunks (trained on 950K words) and 88% for somewhat more complex chunks that partition the sentence (trained on 200K words). Working in this new application and with larger template and training sets has also required some interesting adaptations to the transformation-based learning approach.","Thus , over the past few years , along with advances in the use of learning and statistical methods for acquisition of full parsers ( Collins , 1997 ;

Standard bigram probability estimation techniques are extended to calculate probabilities of dependencies between pairs of words. Tests using Wall Street Journal data show that the method performs at least as well as SPATTER (Magerman 95; Jelinek et al. 94), which has the best published results for a statistical parser on this task. The simplicity of the approach means the model trains on 40,000 sentences in under 15 minutes. With a beam search strategy parsing speed can be improved to over 200 sentences a minute with negligible loss in accuracy.  1 Introduction  Lexical information has been shown to be crucial for many parsing decisions, such as prepositional-phrase attachment (for example (Hindle and Rooth 93)).

While previous empirical methods for base NP identification have been rather complex, this paper instead proposes a very simple algorithm that is tailored to the relative simplicity of the task. In particular, we present a corpus-based approach for finding base NPs by matching part-of-speech tag sequences. The training phase of the algorithm is based on two successful techniques: first the base NP grammar is read from a ""treebank"" corpus; then the grammar is improved by selecting rules with high ""benefit"" scores. Using this simple algorithm with a naive heuristic for matching rules, we achieve surprising accuracy in an evaluation on the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal.","Thus , over the past few years , along with advances in the use of learning and statistical methods for acquisition of full parsers ( Collins , 1997 ;

CC1278,W01-0706,Exploring evidence for shallow parsing,learning to resolve natural language ambiguities a unified approach,['D Roth'],experiments,"We analyze a few of the commonly used statistics based and machine learning algorithms for natural language disambiguation tasks and observe that they can be recast as learning linear separators in the feature space. Each of the methods makes a priori assumptions which it employs, given the data, when searching for its hypothesis. Nevertheless, as we show, it searches a space that is as rich as the space of all linear separators. We use this to build an argument for a data driven approach which merely searches for a good linear separator in the feature space, without further assumptions on the domain or a specific problem.We present such an approach - a sparse network of linear separators, utilizing the Winnow learning algorithm - and show how to use it in a variety of ambiguity resolution problems. The learning approach presented is attribute-efficient and, therefore, appropriate for domains having very large number of attributes.In particular, we present an extensive experimental comparison of our approach with other methods on several well studied lexical disambiguation tasks such as context-sensitive spelling correction, prepositional phrase attachment and part of speech tagging. In all cases we show that our approach either outperforms other methods tried for these tasks or performs comparably to the best.","SNoW ( Carleson et al. , 1999 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) is a multi-class classifier that is specifically tailored for learning in domains in which the potential number of information sources ( features ) taking part in decisions is very large , of which NLP is a principal example .","['The shallow parser used is the SNoW-based CSCL parser (Punyakanok and Roth, 2001;Munoz et al., 1999).', 'SNoW ( Carleson et al. , 1999 ;

CC1281,W01-0706,Exploring evidence for shallow parsing,a memorybased approach to learning shallow natural language patterns,"['S Argamon', 'I Dagan', 'Y Krymolowski']",introduction,"Recognizing shallow linguistic patterns, such as basic syntactic relationships between words, is a common task in applied natural language and text processing. The common practice for approaching this task is by tedious manual definition of possible pattern structures, often in the form of regular expressions or finite automata. This paper presents a novel memory-based learning method that recognizes shallow patterns in new text based on a bracketed training corpus. The training data are stored as-is, in efficient suffix-tree data structures. Generalization is performed on-line at recognition time by comparing subsequences of the new text to positive and negative evidence in the corpus. This way, no information in the training is lost, as can happen in other learning systems that construct a single generalized model at the time of training. The paper presents experimental results for recognizing noun phrase, subject-verb and verb-object patterns in English. Since the learning approach enables easy porting to new domains, we plan to apply it to syntactic patterns in other languages and to sub-language patterns for information extraction.","Thus , over the past few years , along with advances in the use of learning and statistical methods for acquisition of full parsers ( Collins , 1997 ;

CC1283,W01-0706,Exploring evidence for shallow parsing,a linear observed time statistical parser based on maximum entropy models,['A Ratnaparkhi'],introduction,"This paper presents a statistical parser for natural language that obtains a parsing accuracy---roughly 87% precision and 86% recall---which surpasses the best previously published results on the Wall St. Journal domain. The parser itself requires very little human intervention, since the information it uses to make parsing decisions is specified in a concise and simple manner, and is combined in a fully automatic way under the maximum entropy framework. The observed running time of the parser on a test sentence is linear with respect to the sentence length. Furthermore, the parser returns several scored parses for a sentence, and this paper shows that a scheme to pick the best parse from the 20 highest scoring parses could yield a dramatically higher accuracy of 93% precision and recall.","Thus , over the past few years , along with advances in the use of learning and statistical methods for acquisition of full parsers ( Collins , 1997 ; Charniak , 1997a ; Charniak , 1997b ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) , significant progress has been made on the use of statistical learning methods to recognize shallow parsing patterns syntactic phrases or words that participate in a syntactic relationship ( Church , 1988 ; Ramshaw and Marcus , 1995 ; Argamon et al. , 1998 ; Cardie and Pierce , 1998 ; Munoz et al. , 1999 ; Punyakanok and Roth , 2001 ; Buchholz et al. , 1999 ; Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz , 2000 ) .","['Shallow parsing is studied as an alternative to full-sentence parsing.', 'Rather than producing a complete analysis of sentences, the alternative is to perform only partial analysis of the syntactic structures in a text (Harris, 1957;Abney, 1991;Greffenstette, 1993).', 'A lot of recent work on shallow parsing has been influenced by Abney\'s work (Abney, 1991), who has suggested to ""chunk"" sentences to base level phrases.', 'For example, the sentence ""He reckons the current account deficit will narrow to only $ 1.8 billion in September .""', 'would be chunked as follows (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000): While earlier work in this direction concentrated on manual construction of rules, most of the recent work has been motivated by the observation that shallow syntactic information can be extracted using local information -by examining the pattern itself, its nearby context and the local part-of-speech information.', 'Thus , over the past few years , along with advances in the use of learning and statistical methods for acquisition of full parsers ( Collins , 1997 ; Charniak , 1997a ; Charniak , 1997b ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) , significant progress has been made on the use of statistical learning methods to recognize shallow parsing patterns syntactic phrases or words that participate in a syntactic relationship ( Church , 1988 ; Ramshaw and Marcus , 1995 ; Argamon et al. , 1998 ; Cardie and Pierce , 1998 ; Munoz et al. , 1999 ; Punyakanok and Roth , 2001 ; Buchholz et al. , 1999 ; Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz , 2000 ) .']",0,['Tateisi et al. also translated LTAG into HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .'],"['Tateisi et al. also translated LTAG into HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'However, their method depended on translators intuitive analy- sis of the original grammar.']","['Tateisi et al. also translated LTAG into HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'However, their method depended on translators intuitive analy- sis of the original grammar.']",['Tateisi et al. also translated LTAG into HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .'],"['Tateisi et al. also translated LTAG into HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'However, their method depended on translators intuitive analy- sis of the original grammar.', 'Thus the transla- tion was manual and grammar dependent.']","['Tateisi et al. also translated LTAG into HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'However, their method depended on translators intuitive analy- sis of the original grammar.']","['Tateisi et al. also translated LTAG into HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'However, their method depended on translators intuitive analy- sis of the original grammar.', 'Thus the transla- tion was manual and grammar dependent.']",['Tateisi et al. also translated LTAG into HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .'],"['Tateisi et al. also translated LTAG into HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'However, their method depended on translators intuitive analy- sis of the original grammar.', 'Thus the transla- tion was manual and grammar dependent.', 'The manual translation demanded considerable efforts from the translator, and obscures the equiva- lence between the original and obtained gram- mars.']"

CC1294,W01-1510,Resource sharing among HPSG and LTAG communities by a method of grammar conversion from FB-LTAG to HPSG,parsing strategies with ‘lexicalized’ grammars application to tree adjoining grammars,"['Yves Schabes', 'Anne Abeille', 'Aravind K Joshi']",introduction,"In this paper we present a general parsing strategy that arose from the development of an Earley-type parsing algorithm for TAGs (Schabes and Joshi 1988) and from recent linguistic work in TAGs (Abeille 1988).In our approach elementary structures are associated with their lexical heads. These structures specify extended domains of locality (as compared to a context-free grammar) over which constraints can be stated. These constraints either hold within the elementary structure itself or specify what other structures can be composed with a given elementary structure.We state the conditions under which context-free based grammars can be 'lexicalized' without changing the linguistic structures originally produced. We argue that even if one extends the domain of locality of CFGs to trees, using only substitution does not give the freedom to choose the head of each structure. We show how adjunction allows us to 'lexicalize' a CFG freely.We then show how a 'lexicalized' grammar naturally follows from the extended domain of locality of TAGs and present some of the linguistic advantages of our approach.A novel general parsing strategy for 'lexicalized' grammars is discussed. In a first stage, the parser builds a set structures corresponding to the input sentence and in a second stage, the sentence is parsed with respect to this set. The strategy is independent of the linguistic theory adopted and of the underlying grammar formalism. However, we focus our attention on TAGs. Since the set of trees needed to parse an input sentence is supposed to be finite, the parser can use in principle any search strategy. Thus, in particular, a top-down strategy can be used since problems due to recursive structures are eliminated. The parser is also able to use non-local information to guide the search.We then explain how the Earley-type parser for TAGs can be modified to take advantage of this approach.",LTAG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) is a grammar formalism that provides syntactic analyses for a sentence by composing elementary trees with two opera - Figure 6: Parsing with an HPSG grammar,['LTAG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) is a grammar formalism that provides syntactic analyses for a sentence by composing elementary trees with two opera - Figure 6: Parsing with an HPSG grammar'],0,"['The manual translation demanded considerable efforts from the translator, and obscures the equivalence between the original and obtained grammars.', 'Other works ( Kasper et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) convert HPSG grammars into LTAG grammars .']","['Other works ( Kasper et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) convert HPSG grammars into LTAG grammars .']","['The manual translation demanded considerable efforts from the translator, and obscures the equivalence between the original and obtained grammars.', 'Other works ( Kasper et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) convert HPSG grammars into LTAG grammars .']","['Thus the translation was manual and grammar dependent.', 'The manual translation demanded considerable efforts from the translator, and obscures the equivalence between the original and obtained grammars.', 'Other works ( Kasper et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) convert HPSG grammars into LTAG grammars .']","['Other works ( Kasper et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) convert HPSG grammars into LTAG grammars .']","['Thus the translation was manual and grammar dependent.', 'The manual translation demanded considerable efforts from the translator, and obscures the equivalence between the original and obtained grammars.', 'Other works ( Kasper et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) convert HPSG grammars into LTAG grammars .']","['The manual translation demanded considerable efforts from the translator, and obscures the equivalence between the original and obtained grammars.', 'Other works ( Kasper et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) convert HPSG grammars into LTAG grammars .']","[""However, their method depended on translator's intuitive analysis of the original grammar."", 'Thus the translation was manual and grammar dependent.', 'The manual translation demanded considerable efforts from the translator, and obscures the equivalence between the original and obtained grammars.', 'Other works ( Kasper et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) convert HPSG grammars into LTAG grammars .']","['Other works ( Kasper et al. , 1995 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) convert HPSG grammars into LTAG grammars .', 'However, given the greater expressive power of HPSG, it is impossible to convert an arbitrary HPSG grammar into an LTAG grammar.', 'Therefore, a conversion from HPSG into LTAG often requires some restrictions on the HPSG grammar to suppress its generative capacity.', 'Thus, the conversion loses the equivalence of the grammars, and we cannot gain the above advantages.']"

The aim of this work is to see the coverage and accuracy attainable using an underspecified grammar. Underspecification, allowed in a typed feature structure formalism, enables us to write down a wide-coverage grammar concisely.

Furthermore, word-specific constraints such as subcategorization of verbs are not fixed in the grammar. However, this grammar can generate parse trees for 87% of the 10000 sentences in the Japanese EDR corpus. The dependency accuracy is 78% when a parser uses the heuristic that every bunsetsu is attached to the nearest possible one.","Our group has developed a wide-coverage HPSG grammar for Japanese ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , which is used in a high-accuracy Japanese dependency analyzer ( Kanayama et al. , 2000 ) .","['There are a variety of works on efficient parsing with HPSG, which allow the use of HPSGbased processing in practical application contexts .', 'Stanford University is developing the English Resource Grammar, an HPSG grammar for English, as a part of the Linguistic Grammars Online (LinGO) project (Flickinger, 2000).', 'In practical context, German, English, and Japanese HPSG-based grammars are developed and used in the Verbmobil project (Kay et al., 1994).', 'Our group has developed a wide-coverage HPSG grammar for Japanese ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , which is used in a high-accuracy Japanese dependency analyzer ( Kanayama et al. , 2000 ) .']",0,"['An HPSG grammar consists of lexical entries and ID grammar rules , each of which is described with typed feature structures ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['An HPSG grammar consists of lexical entries and ID grammar rules , each of which is described with typed feature structures ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'A lexical entry for each word expresses the characteristics of the word, such as the subcategorization frame and the grammatical category.']","['An HPSG grammar consists of lexical entries and ID grammar rules , each of which is described with typed feature structures ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'A lexical entry for each word expresses the characteristics of the word, such as the subcategorization frame and the grammatical category.']","['An HPSG grammar consists of lexical entries and ID grammar rules , each of which is described with typed feature structures ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['An HPSG grammar consists of lexical entries and ID grammar rules , each of which is described with typed feature structures ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'A lexical entry for each word expresses the characteristics of the word, such as the subcategorization frame and the grammatical category.', 'An ID grammar rule represents a relation between a mother and its daughters, and is independent of lexical characteristics.']","['An HPSG grammar consists of lexical entries and ID grammar rules , each of which is described with typed feature structures ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'A lexical entry for each word expresses the characteristics of the word, such as the subcategorization frame and the grammatical category.']","['An HPSG grammar consists of lexical entries and ID grammar rules , each of which is described with typed feature structures ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'A lexical entry for each word expresses the characteristics of the word, such as the subcategorization frame and the grammatical category.', 'An ID grammar rule represents a relation between a mother and its daughters, and is independent of lexical characteristics.']","['An HPSG grammar consists of lexical entries and ID grammar rules , each of which is described with typed feature structures ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['An HPSG grammar consists of lexical entries and ID grammar rules , each of which is described with typed feature structures ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'A lexical entry for each word expresses the characteristics of the word, such as the subcategorization frame and the grammatical category.', 'An ID grammar rule represents a relation between a mother and its daughters, and is independent of lexical characteristics.', 'Figure 6 illustrates an example of bottom-up parsing with an HPSG grammar.']"

Local researchers working on linguistics, computational linguistics, and logic programming were investigating notions of category, type, feature, term, and partial specification that appeared to converge to a powerful new approach for describing (linguistic) objects and their relationships by monotonic accumulation of constraints between their features. The seed notions had almost independently arisen in generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar et al. 1985), lexical-functional grammar (LFG) (Bresnan and Kaplan 1982), functionalunification grammar (FUG) (Kay 1985), logic programming (Colmerauer 1978, Pereira and Warren 1980), and terminological reasoning systems (Ait-Kaci 1984). It took, however, a lot of experimental and theoretical work to identify precisely what the core notions were, how particular systems related to the core notions, and what were the most illuminating mathematical accounts of that core. The development of the unificationbased formalism PATR-II (Shieber 1984) was an early step toward the definition of the core, but its mathematical analysis, and the clarification of the connections between the various systems, are only now coming to a reasonable closure. The Logic of Typed Feature Structures is the first monograph that brings all the main theoretical ideas into one place where they can be related and compared in a unified setting. Carpenter's book touches most of the crucial questions of the developments during the decade, provides proofs for central results, and reaches right up to the edge of current research in the field. These contributions alone make it an indispensable compendium for the researcher or graduate student working on constraint-based grammatical formalisms, and they also make it a very useful reference work for researchers in object-oriented databases and logic programming. Having discharged the main obligation of the reviewer of saying who should read the book under review and why, I will now survey each of the book's four parts while raising some more general questions impinging on the whole book as they arise from the discussion of each part.","An HPSG grammar consists of lexical entries and ID grammar rules , each of which is described with typed feature

CC1300,W01-1510,Resource sharing among HPSG and LTAG communities by a method of grammar conversion from FB-LTAG to HPSG,a lexicalized tree adjoining grammar for english,['The XTAG Research Group'],introduction,"This paper presents a sizable grammar for English written in the Tree Adjoining grammar (TAG) formalism. The grammar uses a TAG that is both lexicalized (Schabes, Abeille, Joshi 1988) and feature-based (VijayShankar, Joshi 1988). In this paper, we describe a wide range of phenomena that it covers. A Lexicalized TAG (LTAG) is organized around a lexicon, which associates sets of elementary trees (instead of just simple categories) with the lexical items. A Lexicalized TAG consists of a finite set of trees associated with lexical items, and operations (adjunction and substitution) for composing the trees. A lexical item is called the anchor of its corresponding tree and directly determines both the tree's structure and its syntactic features. In particular, the trees define the domain of locality over which constraints are specified and these constraints are local with respect to their anchor. In this paper, the basic tree structures of the English LTAG are described, along with some relevant features. The interaction between the morphological and the syntactic components of the lexicon is also explained. Next, the properties of the different tree structures are discussed. The use of S complements exclusively allows us to take full advantage of the treatment of unbounded dependencies originally presented in Joshi (1985) and Kroch and Joshi (1985). Structures for auxiliaries and raising-verbs which use adjunction trees are also discussed. We present a representation of prepositional complements that is based on extended elementary trees. This representation avoids the need for preposition incorporation in order to account for double whquestions (preposition stranding and pied-piping) and the pseudo-passive. A treatment of light verb constructions is also given, similar to what Abeille (1988c) has presented. Again, neither noun nor adjective incorporation is needed to handle double passives and to account for CNPC violations in these constructions. TAG'S extended domain of locality allows us to handle, within a single level of syntactic description, phenomena that in other frameworks require either dual analyses or reanalysis. In addition, following Abeille and Schabes (1989), we describe how to deal with semantic non compositionality in verb-particle combinations, light verb constructions and idioms, without losing the internal syntactic composition of these structures. The last sections discuss current work on PRO, case, anaphora and negation, and outline future work on copula constructions and small clauses, optional arguments, adverb movement and the nature of syntactic rules in a lexicalized framework.

A Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) is a tree rewriting system whose linguistic relevance has been extensively studied. A key property of these systems is that a TAG factors recursion from the co-occurrence restrictions. In this thesis, we study some mathematical properties of TAG u27s. We show that TAG u27s have several interesting properties and are a natural generalization of Context Free Grammars. We show the equivalence of the classes of languages generated by TAG u27s with those generated by Head Grammars and a linear version of Indexed Grammars, which have been studied for their linguistic applicability. We define the embedded pushdown automaton, an extention of the pushdown automaton, and prove that they are equivalent to TAG u27s. We show that the class of Tree Adjoining Languages form a substitution closed abstract family of languages, and that each Tree Adjoining Language is a semilinear language. We show that a TAG can be parsed in polynomial time by adapting the Cocke-Kasami-Younger algorithm for CFL u27s. Feature structures, essentially a set of attribute value pairs, have been used in computational linguistics to make statements of equality to capture some linguistic phenomena such as subcategorization and agreement. We embed TAG u27s in a feature structure based framework. We show that the resulting system has several advantages over TAG u27s. We give a mathematical model of this system based on the logical calculus developed by Rounds, Kasper, and Manaster-Ramer.

CC1305,W01-1510,Resource sharing among HPSG and LTAG communities by a method of grammar conversion from FB-LTAG to HPSG,on building a more efficient grammar by exploiting types,['Dan Flickinger'],introduction,"Modern grammar development platforms often support multiple devices for representing properties of a natural language, giving the grammar writer some freedom in implementing analyses of linguistic phenomena. These design alternatives can have dramatic consequences for efficiency both in processing and in grammar building. In this paper I report on three experiments in making systematic modifications to a broad-coverage grammar of English in order to gain efficiency without loss of linguistic elegance. While the experiments are to some degree both platform-dependant and theory-bound, the kinds of modifications reported should be applicable to any unification-based grammar which makes use of types. The results make a strong case for a more visible role for the linguist in the collaborative effort to achieve greater processing efficiency.","Stanford University is developing the English Resource Grammar , an HPSG grammar for English , as a part of the Linguistic Grammars Online ( LinGO ) project ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .","['There are a variety of works on efficient parsing with HPSG, which allow the use of HPSGbased processing in practical application contexts .', 'Stanford University is developing the English Resource Grammar , an HPSG grammar for English , as a part of the Linguistic Grammars Online ( LinGO ) project ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'In practical context, German, English, and Japanese HPSG-based grammars are developed and used in the Verbmobil project (Kay et al., 1994).', 'Our group has developed a wide-coverage HPSG grammar for Japanese (Mitsuishi et al., 1998), which is used in a high-accuracy Japanese dependency analyzer (Kanayama et al., 2000).']",0,"['We can say that the grammar conversion enables us to share HPSG parsing techniques in LTAG parsing.', 'Another paper ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes the detailed analysis on the factor of the difference of parsing performance .']",['Another paper ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes the detailed analysis on the factor of the difference of parsing performance .'],"['We can say that the grammar conversion enables us to share HPSG parsing techniques in LTAG parsing.', 'Another paper ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes the detailed analysis on the factor of the difference of parsing performance .']","['This result implies that parsing techniques for HPSG are also beneficial for LTAG parsing.', 'We can say that the grammar conversion enables us to share HPSG parsing techniques in LTAG parsing.', 'Another paper ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes the detailed analysis on the factor of the difference of parsing performance .']",['Another paper ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes the detailed analysis on the factor of the difference of parsing performance .'],"['This result implies that parsing techniques for HPSG are also beneficial for LTAG parsing.', 'We can say that the grammar conversion enables us to share HPSG parsing techniques in LTAG parsing.', 'Another paper ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes the detailed analysis on the factor of the difference of parsing performance .']","['We can say that the grammar conversion enables us to share HPSG parsing techniques in LTAG parsing.', 'Another paper ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes the detailed analysis on the factor of the difference of parsing performance .']","['Table 2 clearly shows that the HPSG parser is significantly faster than the LTAG parser.', 'This result implies that parsing techniques for HPSG are also beneficial for LTAG parsing.', 'We can say that the grammar conversion enables us to share HPSG parsing techniques in LTAG parsing.', 'Another paper ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes the detailed analysis on the factor of the difference of parsing performance .']",['Another paper ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes the detailed analysis on the factor of the difference of parsing performance .']

A Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) is a tree rewriting system whose linguistic relevance has been extensively studied. A key property of these systems is that a TAG factors recursion from the co-occurrence restrictions. In this thesis, we study some mathematical properties of TAG u27s. We show that TAG u27s have several interesting properties and are a natural generalization of Context Free Grammars. We show the equivalence of the classes of languages generated by TAG u27s with those generated by Head Grammars and a linear version of Indexed Grammars, which have been studied for their linguistic applicability. We define the embedded pushdown automaton, an extention of the pushdown automaton, and prove that they are equivalent to TAG u27s. We show that the class of Tree Adjoining Languages form a substitution closed abstract family of languages, and that each Tree Adjoining Language is a semilinear language. We show that a TAG can be parsed in polynomial time by adapting the Cocke-Kasami-Younger algorithm for CFL u27s. Feature structures, essentially a set of attribute value pairs, have been used in computational linguistics to make statements of equality to capture some linguistic phenomena such as subcategorization and agreement. We embed TAG u27s in a feature structure based framework. We show that the resulting system has several advantages over TAG u27s. We give a mathematical model of this system based on the logical calculus developed by Rounds, Kasper, and Manaster-Ramer. Finally, we propose a restriction of this system and show how parsing of such a system can be done efficiently","This paper describes an approach for sharing resources in various grammar formalisms such as Feature-Based Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar ( FB-LTAG1 ) ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Vijay-Shanker and Joshi , 1988 ) and Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) ( Pollard and Sag , 1994 ) by a method of grammar conversion .","['This paper describes an approach for sharing resources in various grammar formalisms such as Feature-Based Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar ( FB-LTAG1 ) ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Vijay-Shanker and Joshi , 1988 ) and Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) ( Pollard and Sag , 1994 ) by a method of grammar conversion .', 'The RenTAL system automatically converts an FB-LTAG grammar into a strongly equivalent HPSG-style grammar .', 'Strong equivalence means that both grammars generate exactly equivalent parse results, and that we can share the LTAG grammars and lexicons in HPSG applications.', 'Our system can reduce considerable workload to develop a huge resource (grammars and lexicons) from scratch.']",0,['The grammar conversion from LTAG to HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) is the core portion of the RenTAL system .'],['The grammar conversion from LTAG to HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) is the core portion of the RenTAL system .'],['The grammar conversion from LTAG to HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) is the core portion of the RenTAL system .'],['The grammar conversion from LTAG to HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) is the core portion of the RenTAL system .'],['The grammar conversion from LTAG to HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) is the core portion of the RenTAL system .'],['The grammar conversion from LTAG to HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) is the core portion of the RenTAL system .'],['The grammar conversion from LTAG to HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) is the core portion of the RenTAL system .'],['The grammar conversion from LTAG to HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) is the core portion of the RenTAL system .'],['The grammar conversion from LTAG to HPSG ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) is the core portion of the RenTAL system .']

CC1313,W01-1510,Resource sharing among HPSG and LTAG communities by a method of grammar conversion from FB-LTAG to HPSG,twostep tag parsing revisited,"['Peter Poller', 'Tilman Becker']",introduction,"Based on the work in (Poller, 1994) and a minor assumption about a normal form for TAGs, we present a highly simplified version of the twostep parsing approach for TAGs which allows for a much easier analysis of run-time and space complexity. It also snggests how restrictions on the grammars might result in improvements in run-time complexity. The main advantage of a two-step parsing system shows in practical applications like Verbmobil (Bub et al., 1997) where the parser must look at multiple hypotheses supplied by a speech recognizer (encoded in a word hypotheses lattice) and filter out illicit hypotheses as early as possible. The first (context-free) step of our parser filters out some illicit hypotheses fast (O(n3 )); the constructed parsing matrix is then reused for the second step, the complete (O(n6 )) TAG parse.","There have been many studies on parsing techniques ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Flickinger et al. , 2000 ) , ones on disambiguation models ( Chiang , 2000 ; Kanayama et al. , 2000 ) , and ones on programming/grammar-development environment (Sarkar and Wintner, 1999; Doran et al., 2000; Makino et al., 1998).","['Our concern is, however, not limited to the sharing of grammars and lexicons.', 'Strongly equivalent grammars enable the sharing of ideas developed in each formalism.', 'There have been many studies on parsing techniques ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Flickinger et al. , 2000 ) , ones on disambiguation models ( Chiang , 2000 ; Kanayama et al. , 2000 ) , and ones on programming/grammar-development environment (Sarkar and Wintner, 1999; Doran et al., 2000; Makino et al., 1998).', 'These works are restricted to each closed community, and the relation between them is not well discussed.', 'Investigating the relation will be apparently valuable for both communities.']",0,"['In this paper, we show that the strongly equivalent grammars enable the sharing of ""parsing techniques"", which are dependent on each computational framework and have never been shared among HPSG and LTAG communities.', 'We applied our system to the XTAG English grammar ( The XTAG Research #AUTHOR_TAG ) 3 , which is a large-scale FB-LTAG grammar for English .']","['We applied our system to the XTAG English grammar ( The XTAG Research #AUTHOR_TAG ) 3 , which is a large-scale FB-LTAG grammar for English .', 'A parsing experiment shows that an efficient HPSG parser with the obtained grammar achieved a significant speed-up against an existing LTAG parser .']","['In this paper, we show that the strongly equivalent grammars enable the sharing of ""parsing techniques"", which are dependent on each computational framework and have never been shared among HPSG and LTAG communities.', 'We applied our system to the XTAG English grammar ( The XTAG Research #AUTHOR_TAG ) 3 , which is a large-scale FB-LTAG grammar for English .']","['In this paper, we show that the strongly equivalent grammars enable the sharing of ""parsing techniques"", which are dependent on each computational framework and have never been shared among HPSG and LTAG communities.', 'We applied our system to the XTAG English grammar ( The XTAG Research #AUTHOR_TAG ) 3 , which is a large-scale FB-LTAG grammar for English .']","['We applied our system to the XTAG English grammar ( The XTAG Research #AUTHOR_TAG ) 3 , which is a large-scale FB-LTAG grammar for English .', 'A parsing experiment shows that an efficient HPSG parser with the obtained grammar achieved a significant speed-up against an existing LTAG parser .', 'This result implies that parsing techniques for HPSG are also beneficial for LTAG parsing.']","['In this paper, we show that the strongly equivalent grammars enable the sharing of ""parsing techniques"", which are dependent on each computational framework and have never been shared among HPSG and LTAG communities.', 'We applied our system to the XTAG English grammar ( The XTAG Research #AUTHOR_TAG ) 3 , which is a large-scale FB-LTAG grammar for English .', 'A parsing experiment shows that an efficient HPSG parser with the obtained grammar achieved a significant speed-up against an existing LTAG parser .']","['In this paper, we show that the strongly equivalent grammars enable the sharing of ""parsing techniques"", which are dependent on each computational framework and have never been shared among HPSG and LTAG communities.', 'We applied our system to the XTAG English grammar ( The XTAG Research #AUTHOR_TAG ) 3 , which is a large-scale FB-LTAG grammar for English .', 'A parsing experiment shows that an efficient HPSG parser with the obtained grammar achieved a significant speed-up against an existing LTAG parser .', 'This result implies that parsing techniques for HPSG are also beneficial for LTAG parsing.']","['In this paper, we show that the strongly equivalent grammars enable the sharing of ""parsing techniques"", which are dependent on each computational framework and have never been shared among HPSG and LTAG communities.', 'We applied our system to the XTAG English grammar ( The XTAG Research #AUTHOR_TAG ) 3 , which is a large-scale FB-LTAG grammar for English .']","['We applied our system to the XTAG English grammar ( The XTAG Research #AUTHOR_TAG ) 3 , which is a large-scale FB-LTAG grammar for English .', 'A parsing experiment shows that an efficient HPSG parser with the obtained grammar achieved a significant speed-up against an existing LTAG parser .', 'This result implies that parsing techniques for HPSG are also beneficial for LTAG parsing.', 'We can say that the grammar conversion enables us to share HPSG parsing techniques in LTAG parsing.']"

CC1315,W01-1510,Resource sharing among HPSG and LTAG communities by a method of grammar conversion from FB-LTAG to HPSG,a lexicalized tree adjoining grammar for english,['The XTAG Research Group'],introduction,"This paper presents a sizable grammar for English written in the Tree Adjoining grammar (TAG) formalism. The grammar uses a TAG that is both lexicalized (Schabes, Abeille, Joshi 1988) and feature-based (VijayShankar, Joshi 1988). In this paper, we describe a wide range of phenomena that it covers. A Lexicalized TAG (LTAG) is organized around a lexicon, which associates sets of elementary trees (instead of just simple categories) with the lexical items. A Lexicalized TAG consists of a finite set of trees associated with lexical items, and operations (adjunction and substitution) for composing the trees. A lexical item is called the anchor of its corresponding tree and directly determines both the tree's structure and its syntactic features. In particular, the trees define the domain of locality over which constraints are specified and these constraints are local with respect to their anchor. In this paper, the basic tree structures of the English LTAG are described, along with some relevant features. The interaction between the morphological and the syntactic components of the lexicon is also explained. Next, the properties of the different tree structures are discussed. The use of S complements exclusively allows us to take full advantage of the treatment of unbounded dependencies originally presented in Joshi (1985) and Kroch and Joshi (1985). Structures for auxiliaries and raising-verbs which use adjunction trees are also discussed. We present a representation of prepositional complements that is based on extended elementary trees. This representation avoids the need for preposition incorporation in order to account for double whquestions (preposition stranding and pied-piping) and the pseudo-passive. A treatment of light verb constructions is also given, similar to what Abeille (1988c) has presented. Again, neither noun nor adjective incorporation is needed to handle double passives and to account for CNPC violations in these constructions. TAG'S extended domain of locality allows us to handle, within a single level of syntactic description, phenomena that in other frameworks require either dual analyses or reanalysis. In addition, following Abeille and Schabes (1989), we describe how to deal with semantic non compositionality in verb-particle combinations, light verb constructions and idioms, without losing the internal syntactic composition of these structures. The last sections discuss current work on PRO, case, anaphora and negation, and outline future work on copula constructions and small clauses, optional arguments, adverb movement and the nature of syntactic rules in a lexicalized framework.

CC1317,W02-0309,Biomedical text retrieval in languages with a complex morphology,how effective is suffixing,['D Harman'],conclusion,"s and titles from the Cranfield collection (with 225 queries and 1400 documents), comprised the major test collection for this study. The Medlars collection (30 queries and 1033 documents), and the CACM collection (64 queries and 3204 documents) were used to provide information about the variation of stemming performance across different subject areas and test collections. In addition to the standard recall/precision measures, with SMART system averaging (Salton, 1971), several methods more suited to an interactive retrieval environment were adopted. The interactive environment returns lists of the top ranked documents, and allows the users to scan titles of a group of documents a screenful at a time, so that the ranking of individual documents within the screenful is not as important as the total number of relevant titles within a screen. Furthermore, the number of relevant documents in the first few screens is far more important for the user than the number of relevant in the last screenfuls. Three measures were selected which evaluate performance at given rank cutoff points, such as those corresponding to a screenful of document titles. The first measure, the E measure (Van Rijsbergen, 1979), is a weighted combination of recall and precision that evaluates a set of retrieved documents at a given cutoff, ignoring the ranking within that set. The measure may have weights of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 which correspond, respectively, to attaching half the importance to recall as to precision, equal importance to both, and double importance to recall. A lower E value indicates a more effective performance. A second measure, the total number of relevant documents retrieved by a given cutoff, was also calculated. Cutoffs of 10 and 30 documents were used, with ten reflecting a minimum number a user might be expected to TABLE 2. Retrieval performance for Cranfteld 225. scan, and 30 being an assumed upper limit of what a user would scan before query modification. The third measure applicable to the interactive environment is the number of queries that retrieve no relevant documents by the given cutoff. This measure is important because many types of query modification techniques, such as relevance feedback, require relevant documents to be in the retrieved set to work well. These measures were all used in Croft (1983) as complementary measures to the standard recall/precision evaluation.","There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Krovetz , 1993 ; Hull , 1996 ) .","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Krovetz , 1993 ; Hull , 1996 ) .', 'The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary.', 'Empirical evidence has been brought forward that inflectional and/or derivational stemmers augmented by dictionaries indeed perform substantially better than those without access to such lexical repositories (Krovetz, 1993;Kraaij and Pohlmann, 1996;Tzoukermann et al., 1997).']",0,"['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; Krovetz , 1993 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; Krovetz , 1993 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary.']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; Krovetz , 1993 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary.']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; Krovetz , 1993 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; Krovetz , 1993 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary.', 'Empirical evidence has been brought forward that inflectional and/or derivational stemmers augmented by dictionaries indeed perform substantially better than those without access to such lexical repositories (Krovetz, 1993;Kraaij and Pohlmann, 1996;Tzoukermann et al., 1997).']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; Krovetz , 1993 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary.']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; Krovetz , 1993 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary.', 'Empirical evidence has been brought forward that inflectional and/or derivational stemmers augmented by dictionaries indeed perform substantially better than those without access to such lexical repositories (Krovetz, 1993;Kraaij and Pohlmann, 1996;Tzoukermann et al., 1997).']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; Krovetz , 1993 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; Krovetz , 1993 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary.', 'Empirical evidence has been brought forward that inflectional and/or derivational stemmers augmented by dictionaries indeed perform substantially better than those without access to such lexical repositories (Krovetz, 1993;Kraaij and Pohlmann, 1996;Tzoukermann et al., 1997).']"

CC1319,W02-0309,Biomedical text retrieval in languages with a complex morphology,development of a stemming algorithm,['J Lovins'],introduction,"A stemming algorithm, a procedure to reduce all words with the same stem to a common form, is useful in many areas of computational linguistics and information-retrieval work. While the form of the algorithm varies with its application, certain linguistic problems are common to any stemming procedure. As a basis for evaluation of previous attempts to deal with these problems, this paper first discusses the theoretical and practical attributes of stemming algorithms. Then a new version of a context-sensitive, longest-match stemming algorithm for English is proposed; though developed for use in a library information transfer system, it is of general application. A major linguistic problem in stemming, variation in spelling of stems, is discussed in some detail and several feasible programmed solutions are outlined, along with sample results of one of these methods.","mers ( #AUTHOR_TAG ;

CC1321,W02-0309,Biomedical text retrieval in languages with a complex morphology,an algorithm for suffix stripping,['M Porter'],introduction,"Purpose - The automatic removal of suffixes from words in English is of particular interest in the field of information retrieval. This work was originally published in Program in 1980 and is republished as part of a series of articles commemorating the 40th anniversary of the journal. Design/methodology/approach - An algorithm for suffix stripping is described, which has been implemented as a short, fast program in BCPL. Findings - Although simple, it performs slightly better than a much more elaborate system with which it has been compared.

In response to emerging needs for computer-supported tools we examined three methods for automated coding of German-language free-text diagnosis phrases. We compared a language-independent lexicon-free n-gram approach with one which uses a dictionary of medical morphemes and refines the query by a mapping to SNOMED codes. Both techniques produced a ranked output of possible diagnoses within a vector space framework for retrieval. The results did not reveal any significant difference: The correct diagnosis was found in approximately 40% for three-digit codes, and 30% for four-digit codes. The lexicon-based method was then modified by substituting the vector space ranking by a heuristic approach that capitalizes on the semantic structure of SNOMED, thus raising the number of correct diagnoses significantly (approximately 50% for three-digit codes, and 40% for four-digit codes). As a result, we claim that lexicon-based retrieval methods do not perform better than the lexicon-free ones, unless conceptual knowledge is added.",Unless very high rates of misspellings are to be expected ( this explains the favorable results for trigram indexing in ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) ) one can not really recommend this method .,"['), but at high ones its precision decreases almost dramatically.', 'Unless very high rates of misspellings are to be expected ( this explains the favorable results for trigram indexing in ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) ) one can not really recommend this method .']",1,"['It crawls text/HTML files, produces an inverted file index, and assigns salience weights to terms and documents based on a simple tf-idf metric.', 'The retrieval process relies on the vector space model ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , with the cosine measure expressing the similarity between a query and a document .']","['The retrieval process relies on the vector space model ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , with the cosine measure expressing the similarity between a query and a document .', 'The search engine produces a ranked output of documents.']","['It crawls text/HTML files, produces an inverted file index, and assigns salience weights to terms and documents based on a simple tf-idf metric.', 'The retrieval process relies on the vector space model ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , with the cosine measure expressing the similarity between a query and a document .', 'The search engine produces a ranked output of documents.']","['For unbiased evaluation of our approach, we used a home-grown search engine (implemented in the PYTHON script language).', 'It crawls text/HTML files, produces an inverted file index, and assigns salience weights to terms and documents based on a simple tf-idf metric.', 'The retrieval process relies on the vector space model ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , with the cosine measure expressing the similarity between a query and a document .']","['The retrieval process relies on the vector space model ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , with the cosine measure expressing the similarity between a query and a document .', 'The search engine produces a ranked output of documents.']","['For unbiased evaluation of our approach, we used a home-grown search engine (implemented in the PYTHON script language).', 'It crawls text/HTML files, produces an inverted file index, and assigns salience weights to terms and documents based on a simple tf-idf metric.', 'The retrieval process relies on the vector space model ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , with the cosine measure expressing the similarity between a query and a document .', 'The search engine produces a ranked output of documents.']","['It crawls text/HTML files, produces an inverted file index, and assigns salience weights to terms and documents based on a simple tf-idf metric.', 'The retrieval process relies on the vector space model ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , with the cosine measure expressing the similarity between a query and a document .', 'The search engine produces a ranked output of documents.']","['For unbiased evaluation of our approach, we used a home-grown search engine (implemented in the PYTHON script language).', 'It crawls text/HTML files, produces an inverted file index, and assigns salience weights to terms and documents based on a simple tf-idf metric.', 'The retrieval process relies on the vector space model ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , with the cosine measure expressing the similarity between a query and a document .']","['The retrieval process relies on the vector space model ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , with the cosine measure expressing the similarity between a query and a document .', 'The search engine produces a ranked output of documents.']"

This version has a significantly better Recall than a system without stemming, without a significant deterioration of Precision.","Empirical evidence has been brought forward that inflectional and/or derivational stemmers augmented by dictionaries indeed perform substantially better than those without access to such lexical repositories ( Krovetz , 1993 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Tzoukermann et al. , 1997 ) .","['There has been some controversy, at least for simple stemmers (Lovins, 1968;Porter, 1980), about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval (Harman, 1991;Krovetz, 1993;Hull, 1996).', 'The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary.', 'Empirical evidence has been brought forward that inflectional and/or derivational stemmers augmented by dictionaries indeed perform substantially better than those without access to such lexical repositories ( Krovetz , 1993 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Tzoukermann et al. , 1997 ) .']",0,"['Furthermore, medical terminology is characterized by a typical mix of Latin and Greek roots with the corresponding host language (e.g., German), often referred to as neo-classical compounding (Mc-Cray et al., 1988).', 'While this is simply irrelevant for general-purpose morphological analyzers , dealing with such phenomena is crucial for any attempt to cope adequately with medical free-texts in an IR setting ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['While this is simply irrelevant for general-purpose morphological analyzers , dealing with such phenomena is crucial for any attempt to cope adequately with medical free-texts in an IR setting ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['Furthermore, medical terminology is characterized by a typical mix of Latin and Greek roots with the corresponding host language (e.g., German), often referred to as neo-classical compounding (Mc-Cray et al., 1988).', 'While this is simply irrelevant for general-purpose morphological analyzers , dealing with such phenomena is crucial for any attempt to cope adequately with medical free-texts in an IR setting ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['Furthermore, medical terminology is characterized by a typical mix of Latin and Greek roots with the corresponding host language (e.g., German), often referred to as neo-classical compounding (Mc-Cray et al., 1988).', 'While this is simply irrelevant for general-purpose morphological analyzers , dealing with such phenomena is crucial for any attempt to cope adequately with medical free-texts in an IR setting ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['While this is simply irrelevant for general-purpose morphological analyzers , dealing with such phenomena is crucial for any attempt to cope adequately with medical free-texts in an IR setting ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['Furthermore, medical terminology is characterized by a typical mix of Latin and Greek roots with the corresponding host language (e.g., German), often referred to as neo-classical compounding (Mc-Cray et al., 1988).', 'While this is simply irrelevant for general-purpose morphological analyzers , dealing with such phenomena is crucial for any attempt to cope adequately with medical free-texts in an IR setting ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['Furthermore, medical terminology is characterized by a typical mix of Latin and Greek roots with the corresponding host language (e.g., German), often referred to as neo-classical compounding (Mc-Cray et al., 1988).', 'While this is simply irrelevant for general-purpose morphological analyzers , dealing with such phenomena is crucial for any attempt to cope adequately with medical free-texts in an IR setting ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['Furthermore, medical terminology is characterized by a typical mix of Latin and Greek roots with the corresponding host language (e.g., German), often referred to as neo-classical compounding (Mc-Cray et al., 1988).', 'While this is simply irrelevant for general-purpose morphological analyzers , dealing with such phenomena is crucial for any attempt to cope adequately with medical free-texts in an IR setting ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['While this is simply irrelevant for general-purpose morphological analyzers , dealing with such phenomena is crucial for any attempt to cope adequately with medical free-texts in an IR setting ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']"

CC1329,W02-0309,Biomedical text retrieval in languages with a complex morphology,development of a stemming algorithm,['J Lovins'],conclusion,"A stemming algorithm, a procedure to reduce all words with the same stem to a common form, is useful in many areas of computational linguistics and information-retrieval work. While the form of the algorithm varies with its application, certain linguistic problems are common to any stemming procedure. As a basis for evaluation of previous attempts to deal with these problems, this paper first discusses the theoretical and practical attributes of stemming algorithms. Then a new version of a context-sensitive, longest-match stemming algorithm for English is proposed; though developed for use in a library information transfer system, it is of general application. A major linguistic problem in stemming, variation in spelling of stems, is discussed in some detail and several feasible programmed solutions are outlined, along with sample results of one of these methods.","There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; Krovetz , 1993 ; Hull , 1996 ) .","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; Krovetz , 1993 ; Hull , 1996 ) .', 'The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary.', 'Empirical evidence has been brought forward that inflectional and/or derivational stemmers augmented by dictionaries indeed perform substantially better than those without access to such lexical repositories (Krovetz, 1993;Kraaij and Pohlmann, 1996;Tzoukermann et al., 1997).']",0,"['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Hull , 1996 ) .']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Hull , 1996 ) .', 'The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary.']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Hull , 1996 ) .', 'The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary.']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Hull , 1996 ) .']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Hull , 1996 ) .', 'The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary.', 'Empirical evidence has been brought forward that inflectional and/or derivational stemmers augmented by dictionaries indeed perform substantially better than those without access to such lexical repositories (Krovetz, 1993;Kraaij and Pohlmann, 1996;Tzoukermann et al., 1997).']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Hull , 1996 ) .', 'The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary.']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Hull , 1996 ) .', 'The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary.', 'Empirical evidence has been brought forward that inflectional and/or derivational stemmers augmented by dictionaries indeed perform substantially better than those without access to such lexical repositories (Krovetz, 1993;Kraaij and Pohlmann, 1996;Tzoukermann et al., 1997).']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Hull , 1996 ) .']","['There has been some controversy , at least for simple stemmers ( Lovins , 1968 ; Porter , 1980 ) , about the effectiveness of morphological analysis for document retrieval ( Harman , 1991 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Hull , 1996 ) .', 'The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary.', 'Empirical evidence has been brought forward that inflectional and/or derivational stemmers augmented by dictionaries indeed perform substantially better than those without access to such lexical repositories (Krovetz, 1993;Kraaij and Pohlmann, 1996;Tzoukermann et al., 1997).']"

Information retrieval has generally not paid much attention to word structure, other than to account for some of the variability in word forms via the use of stemmers. We report on our experiments to determine the importance of morphology, and the effect that it has on performance.

Comparison of stemmed and nonconflated searches suggests that there are no significant increases in the effectiveness of retrieval when stemming is applied to English-language documents and queries. This article reports the use of stemming on Slovene-language documents and queries, and demonstrates that the use of an appropriate stemming algorithm results in a large, and statistically significant, increase in retrieval effectiveness when compared with nonconflated processing; similar comments apply to the use of manual, right-hand truncation. A comparison is made with stemming of English versions of the same documents and queries and it is concluded that the effectiveness of a stemming algorithm is determined by the morphological complexity of the language that it is designed to process.","This has been reported for other languages , too , dependent on the generality of the chosen approach ( J Â¨ appinen and Niemist Â¨ o , 1988 ; Choueka , 1990 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Ekmekc Â¸ ioglu et al. , 1995 ; Hedlund et al. , 2001 ; Pirkola , 2001 ) .","['The efforts required for performing morphologi- cal analysis vary from language to language.', 'For English, known for its limited number of inflection patterns, lexicon-free general-purpose stemmers (Lovins, 1968; Porter, 1980) demonstrably improve retrieval performance.', 'This has been reported for other languages , too , dependent on the generality of the chosen approach ( J Â¨ appinen and Niemist Â¨ o , 1988 ; Choueka , 1990 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Ekmekc Â¸ ioglu et al. , 1995 ; Hedlund et al. , 2001 ; Pirkola , 2001 ) .', 'When it comes to a broader scope of morphological analysis, including derivation and composition, even for the English language only restricted, domain-specific algorithms exist.', 'This is particularly true for the medical domain.', 'From an IR view, a lot of specialized research has already been carried out for medical applications, with emphasis on the lexico-semantic aspects of dederivation and decomposition (Pacak et al., 1980; Norton and Pacak, 1983; Wolff, 1984; Wingert, 1985; Dujols et al., 1991; Baud et al., 1998).']",0,"['This will become even more interesting when mappings of our synonym identifiers to a large medical thesaurus (MeSH, (NLM, 2001)) are incorporated into our system.', 'Alternatively , we may think of user-centered comparative studies ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['Alternatively , we may think of user-centered comparative studies ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['This will become even more interesting when mappings of our synonym identifiers to a large medical thesaurus (MeSH, (NLM, 2001)) are incorporated into our system.', 'Alternatively , we may think of user-centered comparative studies ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['It would be interesting to evaluate the retrieval effectiveness (in terms of precision and recall) of different versions of the synonym class indexing approach in those cases where retrieval using word or subword indexes fails due to a complete mismatch between query and documents.', 'This will become even more interesting when mappings of our synonym identifiers to a large medical thesaurus (MeSH, (NLM, 2001)) are incorporated into our system.', 'Alternatively , we may think of user-centered comparative studies ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['Alternatively , we may think of user-centered comparative studies ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['It would be interesting to evaluate the retrieval effectiveness (in terms of precision and recall) of different versions of the synonym class indexing approach in those cases where retrieval using word or subword indexes fails due to a complete mismatch between query and documents.', 'This will become even more interesting when mappings of our synonym identifiers to a large medical thesaurus (MeSH, (NLM, 2001)) are incorporated into our system.', 'Alternatively , we may think of user-centered comparative studies ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['This will become even more interesting when mappings of our synonym identifiers to a large medical thesaurus (MeSH, (NLM, 2001)) are incorporated into our system.', 'Alternatively , we may think of user-centered comparative studies ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['We have reason to believe that precision cannot be taken as the sole measure for the advantages of a query expansion in cases where the subword approach is already superior (for all layman and expert queries this method retrieved relevant documents, whereas word-based methods failed in 29.6% of the layman queries and 8% of the expert queries, cf.

CC1339,W02-0309,Biomedical text retrieval in languages with a complex morphology,morphological typology of languages for ir,['A Pirkola'],introduction,"This paper presents a morphological classification of languages from the IR perspective. Linguistic typology research has shown that the morphological complexity of every language in the world can be described by two variables, index of synthesis and index of fusion. These variables provide a theoretical basis for IR research handling morphological issues. A common theoretical framework is needed in particular because of the increasing significance of cross-language retrieval research and CLIR systems processing different languages. The paper elaborates the linguistic morphological typology for the purposes of IR research. It studies how the indexes of synthesis and fusion could be used as practical tools in mono- and cross-lingual IR research. The need for semantic and syntactic typologies is discussed. The paper also reviews studies made in different languages on the effects of morphology and stemming in IR.","This has been reported for other languages , too , dependent on the generality of the

Our approach is an example-based approach which relies sorely on example translations kept in a Bilingual Knowledge Bank (BKB). In our approach, a flexible annotation schema called Structured String-Tree Correspondence (SSTC) is used to annotate both the source and target sentences of a translation pair. Each SSTC describes a sentence, a representation tree as well as the correspondences between substrings in the sentence and subtrees in the representation tree. With both the source and target SSTCs established, a translation example in the BKB can then be represented effectively in terms of a pair of synchronous SSTCs. In the process of translation, we first try to build the representation tree for the source sentence (English) based on the example-based parsing algorithm as presented in [1]. By referring to the resultant source parse tree, we then proceed to synthesis the target sentence (Malay) based on the target SSTCs as pointed to by the synchronous SSTCs which encode the relationship

CC1349,W02-1601,A synchronization structure of SSTC and its applications in machine translation,nonisomorphic synchronous tags,"['K Harbusch', 'P Poller']",,"Synchronous tree{adjoining grammars (S{TAGs) combine two standard tree{adjoining grammars (TAGs), e.g., for language transduction in Machine Translation (MT). Recent advances show that the restriction to isomorphic derivation trees (IS{TAGs) ensures eecient transduction because only tree{adjoining languages can be formed in each component. As a result IS{TAGs only allow for  triv-ial"" transfer rules, due to the fact that only isomorphic derivations can be synchronized. This means that only very similar constructions in the two languages can be translated into each other. To overcome these limitations and provide a way of realizing more complex translation phenomena, this paper introduces a new formalism, the dynamic link synchronous tree{adjoining grammars or DLS{TAGs. This formalism allows for the synchronization of non{isomorphic derivation trees by introducing the new concept of dynamic links. DLS{TAGs are more powerful than IS-TAGs. More precisely speaking, DLS{TAGs allow for the formulation of a non{tree{adjoining language in one of the two components. This makes the translation problem more diicult but not untractable as outlined in this paper. However , there remain non{isomorphic translation phenomena which cannot be handled by DLS-TAGs as we also show in this paper.","It allows the construction of a non-TAL ( Shieber , 1994 ) , ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .","['The idea of parallelized formalisms is widely used one, and one which has been applied in many different ways.', 'The use of synchronous formalisms is motivated by the desire to describe two languages that are closely related to each other but that do not have the same structures.', 'For example, synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammar (S-TAG) can be used to relate TAGs for two different languages, for example, for the purpose of immediate structural translation in machine translation (Abeillé et al.,1990), (Harbusch & Poller,1996), or for relating a syntactic TAG and semantic one for the same language (Shieber & Schabes,1990).', 'S-TAG is a variant of Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) introduced by (Shieber & Schabes,1990) to characterize correspondences between tree adjoining languages.', 'Considering the original definition of S-TAGs, one can see that it does not restrict the structures that can be produced in the source and target languages.', 'It allows the construction of a non-TAL ( Shieber , 1994 ) , ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'As a result, Shieber (1994) propose a restricted definition for S-TAG, namely, the IS-TAG for isomorphic S-TAG.', 'In this case only TAL can be formed in each component.', 'This isomorphism requirement is formally attractive, but for practical applications somewhat too strict.', 'Also contrastive well-known translation phenomena exist in different languages, which cannot be expressed by IS-TAG, Figure 3 illustrates some examples (Shieber, 1994).']",0,"['As mentioned earlier, there are some non-standard phenomena exist between different languages, that cause challenges for synchronized formalisms.', 'In this Section , we will describe some example cases , which are drawn from the problem of using synchronous formalisms to define translations between languages ( e.g. #AUTHOR_TAG cases ) .']","['In this Section , we will describe some example cases , which are drawn from the problem of using synchronous formalisms to define translations between languages ( e.g. #AUTHOR_TAG cases ) .', 'Shieber (1994) cases).']","['As mentioned earlier, there are some non-standard phenomena exist between different languages, that cause challenges for synchronized formalisms.', 'In this Section , we will describe some example cases , which are drawn from the problem of using synchronous formalisms to define translations between languages ( e.g. #AUTHOR_TAG cases ) .', 'Shieber (1994) cases).']","['As mentioned earlier, there are some non-standard phenomena exist between different languages, that cause challenges for synchronized formalisms.', 'In this Section , we will describe some example cases , which are drawn from the problem of using synchronous formalisms to define translations between languages ( e.g. #AUTHOR_TAG cases ) .']","['In this Section , we will describe some example cases , which are drawn from the problem of using synchronous formalisms to define translations between languages ( e.g. #AUTHOR_TAG cases ) .', 'Shieber (1994) cases).', 'Due to lack of space we will only brief on some of these non-standard cases without going into the details.']","['As mentioned earlier, there are some non-standard phenomena exist between different languages, that cause challenges for synchronized formalisms.', 'In this Section , we will describe some example cases , which are drawn from the problem of using synchronous formalisms to define translations between languages ( e.g. #AUTHOR_TAG cases ) .', 'Shieber (1994) cases).']","['As mentioned earlier, there are some non-standard phenomena exist between different languages, that cause challenges for synchronized formalisms.', 'In this Section , we will describe some example cases , which are drawn from the problem of using synchronous formalisms to define translations between languages ( e.g. #AUTHOR_TAG cases ) .', 'Shieber (1994) cases).', 'Due to lack of space we will only brief on some of these non-standard cases without going into the details.']","['As mentioned earlier, there are some non-standard phenomena exist between different languages, that cause challenges for synchronized formalisms.', 'In this Section , we will describe some example cases , which are drawn from the problem of using synchronous formalisms to define translations between languages ( e.g. #AUTHOR_TAG cases ) .']","['In this Section , we will describe some example cases , which are drawn from the problem of using synchronous formalisms to define translations between languages ( e.g. #AUTHOR_TAG cases ) .', 'Shieber (1994) cases).', 'Due to lack of space we will only brief on some of these non-standard cases without going into the details.']"

These features are very much desired in grammar writing, in particular for the treatment of certain linguistic phenomena which are 'non-standard', namely featurisation, lexicalisation and crossed dependencies [2,3].

It consists of a hub that allows communication among servers connected to it by message passing and supports the plug-and-play paradigm. In addition to message passing it supports high bandwidth data (binary or audio) transfer between servers via a brokering scheme. For several reasons, we believe that it is the right time to start developing a distributed framework for speech recognition along with data and protocol standards supporting interoperability. We present our work towards that goal using the Colorado University (CU) Sonic recognizer. We divide Sonic into a number of components and structure it around the Hub.

Since the output of the taggers is noisy, there is a question of which newly labelled examples to add to the training set. We investigate selecting examples by directly maximising tagger agreement on unlabelled data, a method which has been theoretically and empirically motivated in the co-training literature. Our results show that agreement-based co-training can significantly improve tagging performance for small seed datasets. Further results show that this form of co-training considerably outperforms self-training. However, we find that simply re-training on all the newly labelled data can, in some cases, yield comparable results to agreement-based co-training, with only a fraction of the computational cost.","The implementation has been inspired by experience in extracting information from very large corpora ( Curran and Moens , 2002 ) and performing experiments on maximum entropy sequence tagging ( Curran and Clark , 2003 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .","['The implementation has been inspired by experience in extracting information from very large corpora ( Curran and Moens , 2002 ) and performing experiments on maximum entropy sequence tagging ( Curran and Clark , 2003 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'We have already implemented a POS tagger, chunker, CCG supertagger and named entity recogniser using the infrastructure.', 'These tools currently train in less than 10 minutes on the standard training materials and tag faster than TNT, the fastest existing POS tagger.', 'These tools use a highly optimised GIS implementation and provide sophisticated Gaussian smoothing (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999).', 'We expect even faster training times when we move to conjugate gradient methods.']",4,"['This gives a greater flexibility but the tradeoff is that these tools can run very slowly.', 'Other tools have been designed around particular techniques , such as finite state machines ( Karttunen et al. , 1997 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['Other tools have been designed around particular techniques , such as finite state machines ( Karttunen et al. , 1997 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'However, the source code for these tools is not freely available, so they cannot be extended.']","['This gives a greater flexibility but the tradeoff is that these tools can run very slowly.', 'Other tools have been designed around particular techniques , such as finite state machines ( Karttunen et al. , 1997 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'However, the source code for these tools is not freely available, so they cannot be extended.']","['These tools also store their configuration state, e.g. the transduction rules used in LT CHUNK, in XML configuration files.', 'This gives a greater flexibility but the tradeoff is that these tools can run very slowly.', 'Other tools have been designed around particular techniques , such as finite state machines ( Karttunen et al. , 1997 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['Other tools have been designed around particular techniques , such as finite state machines ( Karttunen et al. , 1997 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'However, the source code for these tools is not freely available, so they cannot be extended.']","['These tools also store their configuration state, e.g. the transduction rules used in LT CHUNK, in XML configuration files.', 'This gives a greater flexibility but the tradeoff is that these tools can run very slowly.', 'Other tools have been designed around particular techniques , such as finite state machines ( Karttunen et al. , 1997 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'However, the source code for these tools is not freely available, so they cannot be extended.']","['This gives a greater flexibility but the tradeoff is that these tools can run very slowly.', 'Other tools have been designed around particular techniques , such as finite state machines ( Karttunen et al. , 1997 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'However, the source code for these tools is not freely available, so they cannot be extended.']","['For example, the suite of LT tools (Mikheev et al., 1999;Grover et al., 2000) perform tokenization, tagging and chunking on XML marked-up text directly.', 'These tools also store their configuration state, e.g. the transduction rules used in LT CHUNK, in XML configuration files.', 'This gives a greater flexibility but the tradeoff is that these tools can run very slowly.', 'Other tools have been designed around particular techniques , such as finite state machines ( Karttunen et al. , 1997 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['Other tools have been designed around particular techniques , such as finite state machines ( Karttunen et al. , 1997 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'However, the source code for these tools is not freely available, so they cannot be extended.']"

We discuss the problems of sentence boundary detection, part-of-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment, natural language parsing, and text categorization under the maximum entropy framework. In practice, we have found that maximum entropy models offer the following advantages:  State-of-the-art accuracy. The probability models for all of the tasks discussed perform at or near state-of-the-art accuracies, or outperform competing learning algorithms when trained and tested under similar conditions. Methods which outperform those presented here require much more supervision in the form of additional human involvement or additional supporting resources.  Knowledge-poor features. The facts used to model the data, or features, are linguistically very simple, or ""knowledge-poor"", but yet succeed in approximating complex linguistic relationships.  Reusable software technology.

Recent advances in corpus-based manual and automatic training methods have shown promise in reducing the time and cost of this porting process. These developments have focused even greater attention on the bottleneck of acquiring reliable, manually tagged training data. This paper describes a new set of integrated tools, collectively called the Alembic Workbench, that uses a mixed-initiative approach to ""bootstrapping"" the manual tagging process, with the goal of reducing the overhead associated with corpus development. Initial empirical studies using the Alembic Workbench to annotate ""named entities"" demonstrates that this approach can approximately double the production rate. As an added benefit, the combined efforts of machine and user produce domain specific annotation rules that can be used to annotate similar texts automatically through the Alembic-NLP system. The ultimate goal of this project is to enable end users to generate a practical domain-specific information extraction system within a single session.","Many provide graphical user interfaces ( GUI ) for manual annotation ( e.g. General Architecture for Text Engineering ( GATE ) ( Cunningham et al. , 1997 ) and the Alembic Workbench ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) ) as well as NLP tools and resources that can be manipulated from the GUI .","['There are a number of generalised NLP systems in the literature.', 'Many provide graphical user interfaces ( GUI ) for manual annotation ( e.g. General Architecture for Text Engineering ( GATE ) ( Cunningham et al. , 1997 ) and the Alembic Workbench ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) ) as well as NLP tools and resources that can be manipulated from the GUI .', 'For instance, GATE currently provides a POS tagger, named entity recogniser and gazetteer and ontology editors (Cunningham et al., 2002).', 'GATE goes beyond earlier systems by using a component-based infrastructure (Cunningham, 2000) which the GUI is built on top of.', 'This allows components to be highly configurable and simplifies the addition of new components to the system.']",0,"['Some of this new data will be manually annotated.', 'For example , 10 million words of the American National Corpus ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) will have manually corrected POS tags , a tenfold increase over the Penn Treebank ( Marcus et al. , 1993 ) , currently used for training POS taggers .']","['For example , 10 million words of the American National Corpus ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) will have manually corrected POS tags , a tenfold increase over the Penn Treebank ( Marcus et al. , 1993 ) , currently used for training POS taggers .', 'This will require more efficient learning algorithms and implementations.']","['Some of this new data will be manually annotated.', 'For example , 10 million words of the American National Corpus ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) will have manually corrected POS tags , a tenfold increase over the Penn Treebank ( Marcus et al. , 1993 ) , currently used for training POS taggers .', 'This will require more efficient learning algorithms and implementations.']","['NLP is experiencing an explosion in the quantity of electronic text available.', 'Some of this new data will be manually annotated.', 'For example , 10 million words of the American National Corpus ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) will have manually corrected POS tags , a tenfold increase over the Penn Treebank ( Marcus et al. , 1993 ) , currently used for training POS taggers .']","['For example , 10 million words of the American National Corpus ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) will have manually corrected POS tags , a tenfold increase over the Penn Treebank ( Marcus et al. , 1993 ) , currently used for training POS taggers .', 'This will require more efficient learning algorithms and implementations.']","['NLP is experiencing an explosion in the quantity of electronic text available.', 'Some of this new data will be manually annotated.', 'For example , 10 million words of the American National Corpus ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) will have manually corrected POS tags , a tenfold increase over the Penn Treebank ( Marcus et al. , 1993 ) , currently used for training POS taggers .', 'This will require more efficient learning algorithms and implementations.']","['Some of this new data will be manually annotated.', 'For example , 10 million words of the American National Corpus ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) will have manually corrected POS tags , a tenfold increase over the Penn Treebank ( Marcus et al. , 1993 ) , currently used for training POS taggers .', 'This will require more efficient learning algorithms and implementations.']","['NLP is experiencing an explosion in the quantity of electronic text available.', 'Some of this new data will be manually annotated.', 'For example , 10 million words of the American National Corpus ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) will have manually corrected POS tags , a tenfold increase over the Penn Treebank ( Marcus et al. , 1993 ) , currently used for training POS taggers .']","['For example , 10 million words of the American National Corpus ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) will have manually corrected POS tags , a tenfold increase over the Penn Treebank ( Marcus et al. , 1993 ) , currently used for training POS taggers .', 'This will require more efficient learning algorithms and implementations.']"

Fundamentally, it demonstrates 'generic patterns' or 'pattern templates' as a powerful new way of creating extensible designs in C++i??a new way to combine templates and patterns that you may never have dreamt was possible, but is. If your work involves C++ design and coding, you should read this book. Highly recommended. i??Herb SutterWhat's left to say about C++ that hasn't already been said? Plenty, it turns out. i??From the Foreword by John VlissidesIn Modern C++ Design, Andrei Alexandrescu opens new vistas for C++ programmers. Displaying extraordinary creativity and programming virtuosity, Alexandrescu offers a cutting-edge approach to design that unites design patterns, generic programming, and C++, enabling programmers to achieve expressive, flexible, and highly reusable code.This book introduces the concept of generic componentsi??reusable design templates that produce boilerplate code for compiler consumptioni??all within C++. Generic components enable an easier and more seamless transition from design to application code, generate code that better expresses the original design intention, and support the reuse of design structures with minimal recoding.The author describes the specific C++ techniques and features that are used in building generic components and goes on to implement industrial strength generic components for real-world applications. Recurring issues that C++ developers face in their day-to-day activity are discussed in depth and implemented in a generic way.

Yet for most core natural  language tasks, algorithms continue  to be optimized, tested and compared  after training on corpora consisting  of only one million words or less. In  this paper, we evaluate the  performance of different learning  methods on a prototypical natural  language disambiguation task,  confusion set disambiguation, when  trained on orders of magnitude more  labeled data than has previously been  used. We are fortunate that for this  particular application, correctly  labeled training data is free.

We investigate selecting examples by directly maximising tagger agreement on unlabelled data, a method which has been theoretically and empirically motivated in the co-training literature. Our results show that agreement-based co-training can significantly improve tagging performance for small seed datasets. Further results show that this form of co-training considerably outperforms self-training.

CC1388,W03-0806,Blueprint for a high performance NLP infrastructure,a gaussian prior for smoothing maximum entropy models,"['Stanley Chen', 'Ronald Rosenfeld']",experiments,"Abstract : In certain contexts, maximum entropy (ME) modeling can be viewed as maximum likelihood training for exponential models, and like other maximum likelihood methods is prone to overfitting of training data. Several smoothing methods for maximum entropy models have been proposed to address this problem, but previous results do not make it clear how these smoothing methods compare with smoothing methods for other types of related models. In this work, we survey previous work in maximum entropy smoothing and compare the performance of several of these algorithms with conventional techniques for smoothing n-gram language models. Because of the mature body of research in n-gram model smoothing and the close connection between maximum entropy and conventional n-gram models, this domain is well-suited to gauge the performance of maximum entropy smoothing methods.

However, the flexibility of ME models is not without cost. While parameter estimation for ME models is conceptually straightforward, in practice ME models for typical natural language tasks are very large, and may well contain many thousands of free parameters. In this paper, we consider a number of algorithms for estimating the parameters of ME models, including iterative scaling, gradient ascent, conjugate gradient, and variable metric methods. Sur-prisingly, the standardly used iterative scaling algorithms perform quite poorly in comparison to the others, and for all of the test problems, a limited-memory variable metric algorithm outperformed the other choices.","An example of this is the estimation of maximum entropy models , from simple iterative estimation algorithms used by Ratnaparkhi ( 1998 ) that converge very slowly , to complex techniques from the optimisation literature that converge much more rapidly ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .","['Efficiency has not been a focus for NLP research in general.', 'However, it will be increasingly important as techniques become more complex and corpus sizes grow.', 'An example of this is the estimation of maximum entropy models , from simple iterative estimation algorithms used by Ratnaparkhi ( 1998 ) that converge very slowly , to complex techniques from the optimisation literature that converge much more rapidly ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'Other attempts to address efficiency include the fast Transformation Based Learning (TBL) Toolkit (Ngai and Florian, 2001) which dramatically speeds up training TBL systems, and the translation of TBL rules into finite state machines for very fast tagging (Roche and Schabes, 1997).', 'The TNT POS tagger (Brants, 2000) has also been designed to train and run very quickly, tagging between 30,000 and 60,000 words per second.']",0,"['For instance, GATE currently provides a POS tagger, named entity recogniser and gazetteer and ontology editors (Cunningham et al., 2002).', 'GATE goes beyond earlier systems by using a component-based infrastructure ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) which the GUI is built on top of .']","['GATE goes beyond earlier systems by using a component-based infrastructure ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) which the GUI is built on top of .', 'This allows components to be highly configurable and simplifies the addition of new components to the system.']","['For instance, GATE currently provides a POS tagger, named entity recogniser and gazetteer and ontology editors (Cunningham et al., 2002).', 'GATE goes beyond earlier systems by using a component-based infrastructure ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) which the GUI is built on top of .', 'This allows components to be highly configurable and simplifies the addition of new components to the system.']","['General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) (Cunningham et al., 1997) and the Alembic Workbench (Day et al., 1997)) as well as NLP tools and resources that can be manipulated from the GUI.', 'For instance, GATE currently provides a POS tagger, named entity recogniser and gazetteer and ontology editors (Cunningham et al., 2002).', 'GATE goes beyond earlier systems by using a component-based infrastructure ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) which the GUI is built on top of .']","['GATE goes beyond earlier systems by using a component-based infrastructure ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) which the GUI is built on top of .', 'This allows components to be highly configurable and simplifies the addition of new components to the system.']","['General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) (Cunningham et al., 1997) and the Alembic Workbench (Day et al., 1997)) as well as NLP tools and resources that can be manipulated from the GUI.', 'For instance, GATE currently provides a POS tagger, named entity recogniser and gazetteer and ontology editors (Cunningham et al., 2002).', 'GATE goes beyond earlier systems by using a component-based infrastructure ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) which the GUI is built on top of .', 'This allows components to be highly configurable and simplifies the addition of new components to the system.']","['For instance, GATE currently provides a POS tagger, named entity recogniser and gazetteer and ontology editors (Cunningham et al., 2002).', 'GATE goes beyond earlier systems by using a component-based infrastructure ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) which the GUI is built on top of .', 'This allows components to be highly configurable and simplifies the addition of new components to the system.']","['Many provide graphical user interfaces (GUI) for manual annotation (e.g.', 'General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) (Cunningham et al., 1997) and the Alembic Workbench (Day et al., 1997)) as well as NLP tools and resources that can be manipulated from the GUI.', 'For instance, GATE currently provides a POS tagger, named entity recogniser and gazetteer and ontology editors (Cunningham et al., 2002).', 'GATE goes beyond earlier systems by using a component-based infrastructure ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) which the GUI is built on top of .']","['GATE goes beyond earlier systems by using a component-based infrastructure ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) which the GUI is built on top of .', 'This allows components to be highly configurable and simplifies the addition of new components to the system.']"

The garden shed  once built by one of the authors had an ad hoc architecture, extracted (somewhat painfully) from the imagination during a slow and non-deterministic process that, luckily, resulted in a structure which keeps the rain on the outside and the mower on the inside (at least for the time being). As well as being ad hoc (i.e. not informed by analysis of similar practice or relevant science or engineering) this architecture is implicit: no explicit design was made, and no records or documentation kept of the construction process.  The pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre, by contrast, was constructed in a process involving explicit design performed by qualified engineers with a wealth of theoretical and practical knowledge of the properties of materials, the relative merits and strengths of different construction techniques, et cetera.  So it is with software: sometimes it is thrown together by  enthusiastic amateurs; sometimes it is architected, built to last, and intended to be 'not something you finish, but something you start' (to paraphrase Brand (1994). A number of researchers argued in the early and middle 1990s that the field of computational infrastructure or architecture for human language computation merited an increase in attention. The reasoning was that the increasingly large-scale and technologically significant nature of language processing science was placing increasing burdens of an engineering nature on research and development workers seeking robust and practical methods (as was the increasingly collaborative nature of research in this field, which puts a large premium on software integration and interoperation). Over the intervening period a number of significant systems and practices have been developed in what we may call Software Architecture for Language Engineering (SALE).  This special issue represented an opportunity for practitioners in this area to report their work in a coordinated setting, and to present a snapshot of the state-ofthe-art in infrastructural work, which may indicate where further development and further take-up of these systems can be of benefit",GATE goes beyond earlier systems by using a component-based infrastructure ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) which

Words are represented by the relative frequency distributions of contexts in which they appear, and relative entropy between those distributions is used as the similarity measure for clustering. Clusters are represented by average context distributions derived from the given words according to their probabilities of cluster membership. In many cases, the clusters can be thought of as encoding coarse sense distinctions. Deterministic annealing is used to find lowest distortion sets of clusters: as the annealing parameter increases, existing clusters become unstable and subdivide, yielding a hierarchical ""soft"" clustering of the data. Clusters are used as the basis for class models of word coocurrence, and the models evaluated with respect to held-out test data.","For these or for a specific domain , basic synonymic dictionaries can be complemented using learning methods based on distributional similarity ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Lin , 1998 ) .","['Cases of intracategorial synonymy are relatively straigthtforward as several electronic synonym dictionnaries for french are available (Ploux, 1997).', 'Multi word expressions however remain a problem as they are often not or only partially included in such dictionnaries.', 'For these or for a specific domain , basic synonymic dictionaries can be complemented using learning methods based on distributional similarity ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Lin , 1998 ) .', 'techniques.']",3,"['""Semantic grammars"" already exist which describe not only the syntax but also the semantics of natural language.', 'Thus for instance , ( Copestake and Flickinger , 2000 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes a Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) which supports the parallel construction of a phrase structure ( or derived ) tree and of a semantic representation and ( Dalrymple , 1999 ) show how to equip Lexical Functional grammar ( LFG ) with a glue semantics .']","['Thus for instance , ( Copestake and Flickinger , 2000 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes a Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) which supports the parallel construction of a phrase structure ( or derived ) tree and of a semantic representation and ( Dalrymple , 1999 ) show how to equip Lexical Functional grammar ( LFG ) with a glue semantics .']","['""Semantic grammars"" already exist which describe not only the syntax but also the semantics of natural language.', 'Thus for instance , ( Copestake and Flickinger , 2000 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes a Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) which supports the parallel construction of a phrase structure ( or derived ) tree and of a semantic representation and ( Dalrymple , 1999 ) show how to equip Lexical Functional grammar ( LFG ) with a glue semantics .']","['""Semantic grammars"" already exist which describe not only the syntax but also the semantics of natural language.', 'Thus for instance , ( Copestake and Flickinger , 2000 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes a Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) which supports the parallel construction of a phrase structure ( or derived ) tree and of a semantic representation and ( Dalrymple , 1999 ) show how to equip Lexical Functional grammar ( LFG ) with a glue semantics .']","['Thus for instance , ( Copestake and Flickinger , 2000 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes a Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) which supports the parallel construction of a phrase structure ( or derived ) tree and of a semantic representation and ( Dalrymple , 1999 ) show how to equip Lexical Functional grammar ( LFG ) with a glue semantics .']","['""Semantic grammars"" already exist which describe not only the syntax but also the semantics of natural language.', 'Thus for instance , ( Copestake and Flickinger , 2000 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes a Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) which supports the parallel construction of a phrase structure ( or derived ) tree and of a semantic representation and ( Dalrymple , 1999 ) show how to equip Lexical Functional grammar ( LFG ) with a glue semantics .']","['""Semantic grammars"" already exist which describe not only the syntax but also the semantics of natural language.', 'Thus for instance , ( Copestake and Flickinger , 2000 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes a Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) which supports the parallel construction of a phrase structure ( or derived ) tree and of a semantic representation and ( Dalrymple , 1999 ) show how to equip Lexical Functional grammar ( LFG ) with a glue semantics .']","['""Semantic grammars"" already exist which describe not only the syntax but also the semantics of natural language.', 'Thus for instance , ( Copestake and Flickinger , 2000 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes a Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) which supports the parallel construction of a phrase structure ( or derived ) tree and of a semantic representation and ( Dalrymple , 1999 ) show how to equip Lexical Functional grammar ( LFG ) with a glue semantics .']","['Thus for instance , ( Copestake and Flickinger , 2000 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ) describes a Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) which supports the parallel construction of a phrase structure ( or derived ) tree and of a semantic representation and ( Dalrymple , 1999 ) show how to equip Lexical Functional grammar ( LFG ) with a glue semantics .']"

In particular, our data-rich digital world offers enormous potential for the exploration of musical transmission and relatedness.  In this article, we explore the 16th- and 17th-century instrumental battaglia (battle piece), a genre with a very distinctive collective identity arising from the use of numerous shared ingredients (including melodic, motivic, textural, harmonic and rhythmic features). However, a battaglia is not defined by the presence of a core set of essential features, and exact concordance between these pieces is often remarkably low. This kind of musical 'family resemblance' (formulated after Wittgenstein) poses a serious challenge to both traditional musicological apparatus (for example, finding aids such as thematic catalogues) and Music Information Retrieval (which has often privileged melodic similarity at the expense of other kinds of musical relatedness).  This case study provides a stimulus for rethinking the complex nature of musical similarity. In doing this, we outline a set of requirements for digital tools that could support the discovery, exploration and representation of these kinds of relationships","It compares favorably to other

In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert manpower, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm.

A controlled study using three classifiers, kNN, LLSF and WORD, was conducted to examine the impact of configuration variations in five versions of Reuters on the observed performance of classifiers. Analysis and empirical evidence suggest that the evaluation results on some versions of Reuters were significantly affected by the inclusion of a large portion of unlabelled documents, mading those results difficult to interpret and leading to considerable confusions in the literature. Using the results evaluated on the other versions of Reuters which exclude the unlabelled documents, the performance of twelve methods are compared directly or indirectly. For indirect compararions, kNN, LLSF and WORD were used as baselines, since they were evaluated on all versions of Reuters that exclude the unlabelled documents. As a global observation, kNN, LLSF and a neural network method had the best performance; except for a Naive Bayes approach, the other learning algorithms also performed relatively well.","Automatic text categorization has been used in search engines , digital library systems , and document management systems ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .","['With the explosive growth of text documents on the web, relevant information retrieval has become a crucial task to satisfy the needs of different end users.', 'To this end, automatic text categorization has emerged as a way to cope with such a problem.', 'Automatic text (or document) categorization attempts to replace and save human effort required in performing manual categorization.', 'It consists of assigning and labeling documents using a set of predefined categories based on document contents.', 'As such, one of the primary objectives of automatic text categorization has been the enhancement and the support of information retrieval tasks to tackle problems, such as information filtering and routing, clustering of related documents, and the classification of documents into pre-specified subject themes.', 'Automatic text categorization has been used in search engines , digital library systems , and document management systems ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'Such applications have included electronic email filtering, newsgroups classification, and survey data grouping.', 'Barq for instance uses automatic categorization to provide similar documents feature (Rachidi et al., 2003).', 'In this paper, NB which is a statistical machine learning algorithm is used to learn to classify non-vocalized 1 Arabic web text documents.']",0,"['Feature selection techniques have been widely used in information retrieval as a means for coping with the large number of words in a document;

In particular, our data-rich digital world offers enormous potential for the exploration of musical transmission and relatedness.  In this article, we explore the 16th- and 17th-century instrumental battaglia (battle piece), a genre with a very distinctive collective identity arising from the use of numerous shared ingredients (including melodic, motivic, textural, harmonic and rhythmic features). However, a battaglia is not defined by the presence of a core set of essential features, and exact concordance between these pieces is often remarkably low. This kind of musical 'family resemblance' (formulated after Wittgenstein) poses a serious challenge to both traditional musicological apparatus (for example, finding aids such as thematic catalogues) and Music Information Retrieval (which has often privileged melodic similarity at the expense of other kinds of musical relatedness).  This case study provides a stimulus for rethinking the complex nature of musical similarity.

Experiments are done on a 'flat' list of terms obtained from an originally hierarchically-structured terminology: the French version of the US National Library of Medicine MeSH thesaurus. We compare the lexically-induced relations with the original MeSH relations: after a quantitative evaluation of their congruence through recall and precision metrics, we perform a qualitative, human analysis of the 'new' relations not present in the MeSH. This analysis shows, on the one hand, the limits of the lexical structuring method.

We survey the most important theories and methods of this new field. First, various problem specifications of ILP are formalized in semantic settings for ILP, yielding a ""model-theory"" for ILP. Second, a generic ILP algorithm is presented. Third, the inference rules and corresponding operators used in ILP are presented, resulting in a ""proof-theory"" for ILP. Fourth, since inductive inference does not produce statements which are assured to follow from what is given, inductive inferences require an alternative form of justification. This can take the form of either probabilistic support or logical constraints on the hypothesis language. Information compression techniques used within ILP are presented within a unifying Bayesian approach to confirmation and corroboration of hypotheses.

The present paper focusses on terminology structuring by lexical methods, which match terms on the basis on their content words, taking morphological variants into account. Experiments are done on a 'flat' list of terms obtained from an originally hierarchically-structured terminology: the French version of the US National Library of Medicine MeSH thesaurus. We compare the lexically-induced relations with the original MeSH relations: after a quantitative evaluation of their congruence through recall and precision metrics, we perform a qualitative, human analysis of the 'new' relations not present in the MeSH. This analysis shows, on the one hand, the limits of the lexical structuring method. On the other hand, it also reveals some specific structuring choices and naming conventions made by the MeSH designers, and emphasizes ontological commitments that cannot be left to automatic structuring.","However , most strategies are based on `` internal  or `` external methods  ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , i.e. methods that rely on the form of terms or on the information gathered from contexts .","['However , most strategies are based on `` internal  or `` external methods  ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , i.e. methods that rely on the form of terms or on the information gathered from contexts .', '(In some cases, an additional resource, such as a dictionary or a thesaurus, is used during the identification process.)', 'The work reported here infers specific semantic relationships based on sets of examples and counterexamples.']",1,"['ASARES has been previously applied to the acquisition of word pairs sharing semantic relations defined in the Generative Lexicon framework ( Pustejovsky , 1995 ) and called qualia relations ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['ASARES has been previously applied to the acquisition of word pairs sharing semantic relations defined in the Generative Lexicon framework ( Pustejovsky , 1995 ) and called qualia relations ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'Here, we propose to use asares in a quite similar way to retrieve our valid N-V pairs.']","['ASARES has been previously applied to the acquisition of word pairs sharing semantic relations defined in the Generative Lexicon framework ( Pustejovsky , 1995 ) and called qualia relations ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'Here, we propose to use asares in a quite similar way to retrieve our valid N-V pairs.']","['ASARES has been previously applied to the acquisition of word pairs sharing semantic relations defined in the Generative Lexicon framework ( Pustejovsky , 1995 ) and called qualia relations ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['ASARES has been previously applied to the acquisition of word pairs sharing semantic relations defined in the Generative Lexicon framework ( Pustejovsky , 1995 ) and called qualia relations ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'Here, we propose to use asares in a quite similar way to retrieve our valid N-V pairs.', 'However, the N-V combinations sought are more specific than those that were identified in these previous experiments.']","['ASARES has been previously applied to the acquisition of word pairs sharing semantic relations defined in the Generative Lexicon framework ( Pustejovsky , 1995 ) and called qualia relations ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'Here, we propose to use asares in a quite similar way to retrieve our valid N-V pairs.']","['ASARES has been previously applied to the acquisition of word pairs sharing semantic relations defined in the Generative Lexicon framework ( Pustejovsky , 1995 ) and called qualia relations ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'Here, we propose to use asares in a quite similar way to retrieve our valid N-V pairs.', 'However, the N-V combinations sought are more specific than those that were identified in these previous experiments.']","['ASARES has been previously applied to the acquisition of word pairs sharing semantic relations defined in the Generative Lexicon framework ( Pustejovsky , 1995 ) and called qualia relations ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['ASARES has been previously applied to the acquisition of word pairs sharing semantic relations defined in the Generative Lexicon framework ( Pustejovsky , 1995 ) and called qualia relations ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'Here, we propose to use asares in a quite similar way to retrieve our valid N-V pairs.', 'However, the N-V combinations sought are more specific than those that were identified in these previous experiments.']"

The qualia noun-verb pair extraction is thus performed by applying the learnt rules on a part-of-speech or semantically tagged text.

In addressing these issues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing the lexical semantics community, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues. Then, I will provide a method for the decomposition of lexical categories and outline a theory of lexical semantics embodying a notion of cocompositionality and type coercion, as well as several levels of semantic description, where the semantic load is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon. I argue that lexical decomposition is possible if it is performed generatively. Rather than assuming a fixed set of primitives. I will assume a fixed number of generative devices that can be seen as constructing semantic expressions. I develop a theory of Qualia Structure, a representation language for lexical items, which renders much lexical ambiguity in the lexicon unnecessary, while still explaining the systematic polysemy that words carry. Finally, I discuss how individual lexical structures can be integrated into the larger lexical knowledge base through a theory of lexical inheritance. This provides us with the necessary principles of global organization for the lexicon, enabling us to fully integrate our natural language lexicon into a conceptual whole.","ASARES has been previously applied to the acquisition of word pairs sharing semantic relations defined in the Generative Lexicon framework ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) and called qualia relations ( Bouillon et al. , 2001 ) .","['ASARES has been previously applied to the acquisition of word pairs sharing semantic relations defined in the Generative Lexicon framework ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) and called qualia relations ( Bouillon et al. , 2001 ) .', 'Here, we propose to use asares in a quite similar way to retrieve our valid N-V pairs.', 'However, the N-V combinations sought are more specific than those that were identified in these previous experiments.']",0,['A number of applications have relied on distributional analysis ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) in order to build classes of semantically related terms .'],"['A number of applications have relied on distributional analysis ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) in order to build classes of semantically related terms .', 'This approach, which uses words that appear in the context of terms to formulate hypotheses on their semantic relatedness (Habert et al., 1996, for example), does not specify the relationship itself.']","['A number of applications have relied on distributional analysis ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) in order to build classes of semantically related terms .', 'This approach, which uses words that appear in the context of terms to formulate hypotheses on their semantic relatedness (Habert et al., 1996, for example), does not specify the relationship itself.']",['A number of applications have relied on distributional analysis ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) in order to build classes of semantically related terms .'],"['A number of applications have relied on distributional analysis ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) in order to build classes of semantically related terms .', 'This approach, which uses words that appear in the context of terms to formulate hypotheses on their semantic relatedness (Habert et al., 1996, for example), does not specify the relationship itself.', 'Hence, synonyms, co-hyponyms, hyperonyms, etc. are not differentiated.']","['A number of applications have relied on distributional analysis ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) in order to build classes of semantically related terms .', 'This approach, which uses words that appear in the context of terms to formulate hypotheses on their semantic relatedness (Habert et al., 1996, for example), does not specify the relationship itself.']","['A number of applications have relied on distributional analysis ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) in order to build classes of semantically related terms .', 'This approach, which uses words that appear in the context of terms to formulate hypotheses on their semantic relatedness (Habert et al., 1996, for example), does not specify the relationship itself.', 'Hence, synonyms, co-hyponyms, hyperonyms, etc. are not differentiated.']",['A number of applications have relied on distributional analysis ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) in order to build classes of semantically related terms .'],"['A number of applications have relied on distributional analysis ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) in order to build classes of semantically related terms .', 'This approach, which uses words that appear in the context of terms to formulate hypotheses on their semantic relatedness (Habert et al., 1996, for example), does not specify the relationship itself.', 'Hence, synonyms, co-hyponyms, hyperonyms, etc. are not differentiated.']"

Experiments performed on small collections with single-domain thesauri suggest that expanding query vectors with words that are lexically related to the original query words can ameliorate some of the problems of mismatched vocabularies. This paper examines the utility of lexical query expansion in the large, diverse TREC collection. Concepts are represented by WordNet synonym sets and are expanded by following the typed links included in WordNet. Experimental results show this query expansion technique makes little difference in retrieval effectiveness if the original queries are relatively complete descriptions of the information being sought even when the concepts to be expanded are selected by hand. Less well developed queries can be significantly improved by expansion of hand-chosen concepts. However, an automatic procedure that can approximate the set of hand picked synonym sets has yet to be devised, and expanding by the synonym sets that are automatically generated can degrade retrieval performance.","Indeed , such rich semantic links can be used to extend indices or reformulate queries ( similar to the work by #AUTHOR_TAG with WoRDNET relations ) .","['Even though this work is carried out for terminographical and lexicographical purposes, it can certainly be of use in other applications, namely information retrieval.', 'Indeed , such rich semantic links can be used to extend indices or reformulate queries ( similar to the work by #AUTHOR_TAG with WoRDNET relations ) .']",1,"['In addition to the different forms of the Arabic word that result from the derivational and inflectional process, most prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, and possessive forms are attached to the Arabic surface word.', 'It is these orthographic variations and complex morphological structure that make Arabic language processing challenging ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Xu et al. , 2002 ) .']","['It is these orthographic variations and complex morphological structure that make Arabic language processing challenging ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Xu et al. , 2002 ) .']","['In addition to the different forms of the Arabic word that result from the derivational and inflectional process, most prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, and possessive forms are attached to the Arabic surface word.', 'It is these orthographic variations and complex morphological structure that make Arabic language processing challenging ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Xu et al. , 2002 ) .']","['In fact, most Arabic words are morphologically derived from a list of base forms or stems, to which prefixes and suffixes can be attached to form Arabic surface forms (blank-delimited words).', 'In addition to the different forms of the Arabic word that result from the derivational and inflectional process, most prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, and possessive forms are attached to the Arabic surface word.', 'It is these orthographic variations and complex morphological structure that make Arabic language processing challenging ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Xu et al. , 2002 ) .']","['It is these orthographic variations and complex morphological structure that make Arabic language processing challenging ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Xu et al. , 2002 ) .']","['In fact, most Arabic words are morphologically derived from a list of base forms or stems, to which prefixes and suffixes can be attached to form Arabic surface forms (blank-delimited words).', 'In addition to the different forms of the Arabic word that result from the derivational and inflectional process, most prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, and possessive forms are attached to the Arabic surface word.', 'It is these orthographic variations and complex morphological structure that make Arabic language processing challenging ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Xu et al. , 2002 ) .']","['In addition to the different forms of the Arabic word that result from the derivational and inflectional process, most prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, and possessive forms are attached to the Arabic surface word.', 'It is these orthographic variations and complex morphological structure that make Arabic language processing challenging ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Xu et al. , 2002 ) .']","['This is particularly true for Arabic where nominals and pronouns are also attached to the word they modify.', 'In fact, most Arabic words are morphologically derived from a list of base forms or stems, to which prefixes and suffixes can be attached to form Arabic surface forms (blank-delimited words).', 'In addition to the different forms of the Arabic word that result from the derivational and inflectional process, most prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, and possessive forms are attached to the Arabic surface word.', 'It is these orthographic variations and complex morphological structure that make Arabic language processing challenging ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Xu et al. , 2002 ) .']","['It is these orthographic variations and complex morphological structure that make Arabic language processing challenging ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Xu et al. , 2002 ) .']"

In one of the components of this lexical model, called the qualia structure, words are described in terms of semantic roles. For example, the telic role indicates the purpose or function of an item (cut for knife), the agentive role its creation mode (build for house), etc. The qualia structure of a noun is mainly made up of verbal associations, encoding relational information. The learning method enables us to automatically extract, from a morpho-syntactically and semantically tagged corpus, N-V pairs whose elements are linked by one of the semantic relations defined in the qualia structure in GL. It also infers rules explaining what in the surrounding context distinguishes such pairs from others also found in sentences of the corpus but which are not relevant. Stress is put here on the learning efficiency that is required to be able to deal with all the available contextual information, and to produce linguistically meaningful rules.",ASARES is presented in detail in ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .,"['The method used for the acquisition of N-V pairs relies mainly on asares, a pattern inference tool.', 'ASARES is presented in detail in ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'We simply give a short account of its basic principles herein.']",5,"['In addition to the model based upon a dictionary of stems and words , we also experimented with models based upon character n-grams , similar to those used for Chinese segmentation ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['In addition to the model based upon a dictionary of stems and words , we also experimented with models based upon character n-grams , similar to those used for Chinese segmentation ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'For these models, both arabic characters and spaces, and the inserted prefix and suffix markers appear on the arcs of the finite state machine.']","['In addition to the model based upon a dictionary of stems and words , we also experimented with models based upon character n-grams , similar to those used for Chinese segmentation ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'For these models, both arabic characters and spaces, and the inserted prefix and suffix markers appear on the arcs of the finite state machine.']","['In addition to the model based upon a dictionary of stems and words , we also experimented with models based upon character n-grams , similar to those used for Chinese segmentation ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['In addition to the model based upon a dictionary of stems and words , we also experimented with models based upon character n-grams , similar to those used for Chinese segmentation ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'For these models, both arabic characters and spaces, and the inserted prefix and suffix markers appear on the arcs of the finite state machine.', 'Here, the language model is conditioned to insert prefix and suffix markers based upon the frequency of their appearance in n-gram character contexts that appear in the training data.']","['In addition to the model based upon a dictionary of stems and words , we also experimented with models based upon character n-grams , similar to those used for Chinese segmentation ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'For these models, both arabic characters and spaces, and the inserted prefix and suffix markers appear on the arcs of the finite state machine.']","['In addition to the model based upon a dictionary of stems and words , we also experimented with models based upon character n-grams , similar to those used for Chinese segmentation ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'For these models, both arabic characters and spaces, and the inserted prefix and suffix markers appear on the arcs of the finite state machine.', 'Here, the language model is conditioned to insert prefix and suffix markers based upon the frequency of their appearance in n-gram character contexts that appear in the training data.']","['In addition to the model based upon a dictionary of stems and words , we also experimented with models based upon character n-grams , similar to those used for Chinese segmentation ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .']","['In addition to the model based upon a dictionary of stems and words , we also experimented with models based upon character n-grams , similar to those used for Chinese segmentation ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'For these models, both arabic characters and spaces, and the inserted prefix and suffix markers appear on the arcs of the finite state machine.', 'Here, the language model is conditioned to insert prefix and suffix markers based upon the frequency of their appearance in n-gram character contexts that appear in the training data.', 'The character based model alone achieves a 94.5% exact match segmentation accuracy, considerably less accurate then the dictionary based model.']"

This task of identifying co-referring noun phrases --- noun phrase coreference resolution --- can present a serious challenge to a natural language processing system, however. Indeed, it is one of the critical problems that currently limits the performance of many practical natural language processing tasks.    State-of-the-art coreference resolution systems operate by relying on a set of hand-crafted heuristics that requires a lot of time and linguistic expertise to develop. Recently, machine learning techniques have been used to circumvent both of these problems by automating the acquisition of coreference resolution heuristics, yielding coreference systems that offer performance comparable to their heuristic-based counterparts. In this dissertation, we present a machine learning-based solution to noun phrase coreference that extends eariler work in the area and outperforms the best existing learning-based coreference engine on a suite of standard coreference data sets. Performance gains accrue from more effective use of the available training data via a set of linguistic and extra-linguistic extensions to the standard machine learning framework for coreference resolution","The EDR has close ties to the named entity recognition ( NER ) and coreference resolution tasks , which have been the focus of several recent investigations ( Bikel et al. , 1997 ;

Both the mention detection model and the novel entity tracking model can use arbitrary feature types, being able to integrate a wide array of lexical, syntactic and semantic features. In addition, the mention detection model crucially uses feature streams derived from different named entity classifiers. The proposed framework is evaluated with several experiments run in Arabic, Chinese and English texts; a system based on the approach described here and submitted to the latest Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) evaluation achieved top-tier results in all three evaluation languages.","The EDR has close ties to the named entity recognition ( NER ) and coreference resolution tasks , which have been the focus of several recent investigations ( Bikel et al. , 1997 ;

CC1465,W05-0709,The impact of morphological stemming on Arabic mention detection and coreference resolution,a maximum entropy approach to named entity recognition,['A Borthwick'],introduction,"This thesis describes a novel statistical named-entity (i.e. ""proper name"") recognition system known as ""MENE"" (Maximum Entropy Named Entity). Named entity (N.E.) recognition is a form of information extraction in which we seek to classify every word in a document as being a person-name, organization, location, date, time, monetary value, percentage, or ""none of the above"". The task has particular significance for Internet search engines, machine translation, the automatic indexing of documents, and as a foundation for work on more complex information extraction tasks.  Two of the most significant problems facing the constructor of a named entity system are the questions of portability and system performance. A practical N.E. system will need to be ported frequently to new bodies of text and even to new languages. The challenge is to build a system which can be ported with minimal expense (in particular minimal programming by a computational linguist) while maintaining a high degree of accuracy in the new domains or languages.  MENE attempts to address these issues through the use of maximum entropy probabilistic modeling. It utilizes a very flexible object-based architecture which allows it to make use of a broad range of knowledge sources in making its tagging decisions. In the DARPA-sponsored MUC-7 named entity evaluation, the system displayed an accuracy rate which was well-above the median, demonstrating that it can achieve the performance goal. In addition, we demonstrate that the system can be used as a post-processing tool to enhance the output of a hand-coded named entity recognizer through experiments in which MENE improved on the performance of N.E. systems from three different sites. Furthermore, when all three external recognizers are combined under MENE, we are able to achieve very strong results which, in some cases, appear to be competitive with human performance.  Finally, we demonstrate the trans-lingual portability of the system. We ported the system to two Japanese-language named entity tasks, one of which involved a new named entity category, ""artifact"". Our results on these tasks were competitive with the best systems built by native Japanese speakers despite the fact that the author speaks no Japanese.","The EDR has close ties to the named entity recognition ( NER ) and coreference resolution tasks , which have been the focus of several recent investigations ( Bikel et al. , 1997 ; Miller et al. , 1998 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Mikheev et al. , 1999 ; Soon et al. , 2001 ; Ng and Cardie , 2002 ; Florian et al. , 2004 ) , and have been at the center of evaluations such as : MUC-6 , MUC-7 , and the CoNLL '02 and CoNLL '03 shared tasks .","['In this paper we focus on the Entity Detection and Recognition task (EDR) for Arabic as described in ACE 2004 framework (ACE, 2004).', ""The EDR has close ties to the named entity recognition ( NER ) and coreference resolution tasks , which have been the focus of several recent investigations ( Bikel et al. , 1997 ; Miller et al. , 1998 ; #AUTHOR_TAG ; Mikheev et al. , 1999 ; Soon et al. , 2001 ; Ng and Cardie , 2002 ; Florian et al. , 2004 ) , and have been at the center of evaluations such as : MUC-6 , MUC-7 , and the CoNLL '02 and CoNLL '03 shared tasks ."", 'Usually, in computational linguistics literature, a named entity is an instance of a location, a person, or an organization, and the NER task consists of identifying each of these occurrences.', 'Instead, we will adopt the nomenclature of the Automatic Content Extraction program (NIST, 2004): we will call the instances of textual references to objects/abstractions mentions, which can be either named (e.g.', 'John Mayor), nominal (the president) or pronominal (she, it).', 'An entity is the aggregate of all the mentions (of any level) which refer to one conceptual entity.', 'For instance, in the sentence President John Smith said he has no comments there are two mentions (named and pronomial) but only one entity, formed by the set {John Smith, he}.']",0,['Features using the word context ( left and right tokens ) have been shown to be very helpful in coreference resolution ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .'],"['Features using the word context ( left and right tokens ) have been shown to be very helpful in coreference resolution ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'For Arabic, since words are morphologically derived from a list of roots (stems), we expected that a feature based on the right and left stems would lead to improvement in system accuracy.']","['Features using the word context ( left and right tokens ) have been shown to be very helpful in coreference resolution ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'For Arabic, since words are morphologically derived from a list of roots (stems), we expected that a feature based on the right and left stems would lead to improvement in system accuracy.']",['Features using the word context ( left and right tokens ) have been shown to be very helpful in coreference resolution ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .'],"['Features using the word context ( left and right tokens ) have been shown to be very helpful in coreference resolution ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'For Arabic, since words are morphologically derived from a list of roots (stems), we expected that a feature based on the right and left stems would lead to improvement in system accuracy.']","['Features using the word context ( left and right tokens ) have been shown to be very helpful in coreference resolution ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'For Arabic, since words are morphologically derived from a list of roots (stems), we expected that a feature based on the right and left stems would lead to improvement in system accuracy.']","['Features using the word context ( left and right tokens ) have been shown to be very helpful in coreference resolution ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'For Arabic, since words are morphologically derived from a list of roots (stems), we expected that a feature based on the right and left stems would lead to improvement in system accuracy.']",['Features using the word context ( left and right tokens ) have been shown to be very helpful in coreference resolution ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .'],"['Features using the word context ( left and right tokens ) have been shown to be very helpful in coreference resolution ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'For Arabic, since words are morphologically derived from a list of roots (stems), we expected that a feature based on the right and left stems would lead to improvement in system accuracy.']"

Our method is seeded by a small manually segmented Arabic corpus and uses it to bootstrap an unsupervised algorithm to build the Arabic word segmenter from a large unsegmented Arabic corpus. The algorithm uses a trigram language model to determine the most probable morpheme sequence for a given input. The language model is initially estimated from a small manually segmented corpus of about 110,000 words. To improve the segmentation accuracy, we use an unsupervised algorithm for automatically acquiring new stems from a 155 million word unsegmented corpus, and re-estimate the model parameters with the expanded vocabulary and training corpus. The resulting Arabic word segmentation system achieves around 97 % exact match accuracy on a test corpus containing 28,449 word tokens.

Both the mention detection model and the novel entity tracking model can use arbitrary feature types, being able to integrate a wide array of lexical, syntactic and semantic features.

In this paper, we present a statistical language-independent framework for identifying and tracking named, nominal and pronominal references to entities within unrestricted text documents, and chaining them into clusters corresponding to each logical entity present in the text. Both the mention detection model and the novel entity tracking model can use arbitrary feature types, being able to integrate a wide array of lexical, syntactic and semantic features. In addition, the mention detection model crucially uses feature streams derived from different named entity classifiers. The proposed framework is evaluated with several experiments run in Arabic, Chinese and English texts; a system based on the approach described here and submitted to the latest Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) evaluation achieved top-tier results in all three evaluation languages.",The context of a current token ti is clearly one of the most important features in predicting whether ti is a mention or not ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .,"['The context of a current token ti is clearly one of the most important features in predicting whether ti is a mention or not ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'We denote these features as backward token tri-grams and forward token tri-grams for the previous and next context of t i respectively.', 'For a token t i , the backward token n-gram feature will contains the previous n − 1 tokens in the history (t i−n+1 , . . .', 't i−1 ) and the forward token n-gram feature will contains the next n − 1 tokens (t i+1 , . . .', 't i+n−1 ).']",0,"['The system is trained on the Arabic ACE 2003 and part of the 2004 data.', 'We introduce here a clearly defined and replicable split of the #AUTHOR_TAG data , so that future investigations can accurately and correctly compare against the results presented here .']","['We introduce here a clearly defined and replicable split of the #AUTHOR_TAG data , so that future investigations can accurately and correctly compare against the results presented here .']","['The system is trained on the Arabic ACE 2003 and part of the 2004 data.', 'We introduce here a clearly defined and replicable split of the #AUTHOR_TAG data , so that future investigations can accurately and correctly compare against the results presented here .']","['The system is trained on the Arabic ACE 2003 and part of the 2004 data.', 'We introduce here a clearly defined and replicable split of the #AUTHOR_TAG data , so that future investigations can accurately and correctly compare against the results presented here .']","['We introduce here a clearly defined and replicable split of the #AUTHOR_TAG data , so that future investigations can accurately and correctly compare against the results presented here .']","['The system is trained on the Arabic ACE 2003 and part of the 2004 data.', 'We introduce here a clearly defined and replicable split of the #AUTHOR_TAG data , so that future investigations can accurately and correctly compare against the results presented here .']","['The system is trained on the Arabic ACE 2003 and part of the 2004 data.', 'We introduce here a clearly defined and replicable split of the #AUTHOR_TAG data , so that future investigations can accurately and correctly compare against the results presented here .']","['The system is trained on the Arabic ACE 2003 and part of the 2004 data.', 'We introduce here a clearly defined and replicable split of the #AUTHOR_TAG data , so that future investigations can accurately and correctly compare against the results presented here .']","['We introduce here a clearly defined and replicable split of the #AUTHOR_TAG data , so that future investigations can accurately and correctly compare against the results presented here .']"

Our method is seeded by a small manually segmented Arabic corpus and uses it to bootstrap an unsupervised algorithm to build the Arabic word segmenter from a large unsegmented Arabic corpus. The algorithm uses a trigram language model to determine the most probable morpheme sequence for a given input. The language model is initially estimated from a small manually segmented corpus of about 110,000 words. To improve the segmentation accuracy, we use an unsupervised algorithm for automatically acquiring new stems from a 155 million word unsegmented corpus, and re-estimate the model parameters with the expanded vocabulary and training corpus. The resulting Arabic word segmentation system achieves around 97 % exact match accuracy on a test corpus containing 28,449 word tokens.

Indeed, the compilation of such  gazetteers is sometimes mentioned as a  bottleneck in the design of Named Entity  recognition systems.  We report on a Named Entity recognition  system which combines rule-based  grammars with statistical (maximum entropy)  models. We report on the system  &apos;s performance with gazetteers of different  types and dierent sizes, using test  material from the muc{7 competition.  We show that, for the text type and task  of this competition, it is sucient to use  relatively small gazetteers of well-known  names, rather than large gazetteers of  low-frequency names. We conclude with  observations about the domain independence  of the competition and of our experiments.  1 Introduction  Named Entity recognition involves processing a text and identifying certain occurrences of words or expressions ..","The EDR has close ties to the named entity recognition ( NER ) and coreference resolution tasks , which have been the focus of several recent investigations ( Bikel et al. , 1997 ;

CC1491,W06-1104,Automatically creating datasets for measures of semantic relatedness,cooccurrence retrieval a flexible framework for lexical distributional similarity,"['Julie Weeds', 'David Weir']",,"Techniques that exploit knowledge of distributional similarity between words have been proposed in many areas of Natural Language Processing. For example, in language modeling, the sparse data problem can be alleviated by estimating the probabilities of unseen co-occurrences of events from the probabilities of seen co-occurrences of similar events. In other applications, distributional similarity is taken to be an approximation to semantic similarity. However, due to the wide range of potential applications and the lack of a strict definition of the concept of distributional similarity, many methods of calculating distributional similarity have been proposed or adopted. In this work, a flexible, parameterized framework for calculating distributional similarity is proposed. Within this framework, the problem of finding distributionally similar words is cast as one of co-occurrence retrieval (CR) for which precision and recall can be measured by analogy with the way they are measured in document retrieval. As will be shown, a number of popular existing measures of distributional similarity are simulated with parameter settings within the CR framework. In this article, the CR framework is then used to systematically investigate three fundamental questions concerning distributional similarity. First, is the relationship of lexical similarity necessarily symmetric, or are there advantages to be gained from considering it as an asymmetric relationship? Second, are some co-occurrences inherently more salient than others in the calculation of distributional similarity? Third, is it necessary to consider the difference in the extent to which each word occurs in each co-occurrence type? Two application-based tasks are used for evaluation: automatic thesaurus generation and pseudo-disambiguation.

We present a new method for computing semantic relatedness of concepts. The method relies solely on the structure of a conceptual network and eliminates the need for performing additional corpus analysis. The network structure is employed to generate artificial conceptual glosses. They replace textual definitions proper written by humans and are processed by a dictionary based metric of semantic relatedness [1]. We implemented the metric on the basis of GermaNet, the German counterpart of WordNet, and evaluated the results on a German dataset of 57 word pairs rated by human subjects for their semantic relatedness. Our approach can be easily applied to compute semantic relatedness based on alternative conceptual networks, e.g. in the domain of life sciences.","We used the revised experimental setup ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , based on discrete relatedness scores and presentation of word pairs in isolation , that is scalable to the higher number of pairs .","['In our experiment, we annotated a high number of pairs similar in size to the test sets by Finkelstein (2002) and Gurevych (2006).', 'We used the revised experimental setup ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) , based on discrete relatedness scores and presentation of word pairs in isolation , that is scalable to the higher number of pairs .', 'We annotated semantic relatedness instead of similarity and included also non noun-noun pairs.', 'Additionally, our corpusbased approach includes domain-specific technical terms and enables evaluation of the robustness of a measure.']",5,"['The latter question is tackled by applicationspecific evaluation , where a measure is tested within the framework of a certain application , e.g. word sense disambiguation ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) or malapropism detection ( Budanitsky and Hirst , 2006 ) .

We present a new method for computing semantic relatedness of concepts.

The network structure is employed to generate artificial conceptual glosses. They replace textual definitions proper written by humans and are processed by a dictionary based metric of semantic relatedness [1]. We implemented the metric on the basis of GermaNet, the German counterpart of WordNet, and evaluated the results on a German dataset of 57 word pairs rated by human subjects for their semantic relatedness. Our approach can be easily applied to compute semantic relatedness based on alternative conceptual networks, e.g. in the domain of life sciences.","As they are required to enable test subjects to distinguish between senses , we use artificial glosses composed from synonyms and hypernyms as a surrogate , e.g. for brother : `` brother , male sibling  vs. `` brother , comrade , friend  ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .","['GermaNet contains only a few conceptual glosses.', 'As they are required to enable test subjects to distinguish between senses , we use artificial glosses composed from synonyms and hypernyms as a surrogate , e.g. for brother : `` brother , male sibling  vs. `` brother , comrade , friend  ( #AUTHOR_TAG ) .', 'We removed words which had more than three senses.']",5,"['Various approaches for computing semantic relatedness of words or concepts have been proposed, e.g.', 'dictionary-based ( Lesk , 1986 ) , ontology-based ( Wu and Palmer , 1994 ; Leacock and Chodorow , 1998 ) , information-based ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Jiang and Conrath , 1997 ) or distributional ( Weeds and Weir , 2005 ) .']","['dictionary-based ( Lesk , 1986 ) , ontology-based ( Wu and Palmer , 1994 ; Leacock and Chodorow , 1998 ) , information-based ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Jiang and Conrath , 1997 ) or distributional ( Weeds and Weir , 2005 ) .', 'The knowledge sources used for computing relatedness can be as different as dictionaries, ontologies or large corpora.']","['Various approaches for computing semantic relatedness of words or concepts have been proposed, e.g.', 'dictionary-based ( Lesk , 1986 ) , ontology-based ( Wu and Palmer , 1994 ; Leacock and Chodorow , 1998 ) , information-based ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Jiang and Conrath , 1997 ) or distributional ( Weeds and Weir , 2005 ) .', 'The knowledge sources used for computing relatedness can be as different as dictionaries, ontologies or large corpora.']","['Various approaches for computing semantic relatedness of words or concepts have been proposed, e.g.', 'dictionary-based ( Lesk , 1986 ) , ontology-based ( Wu and Palmer , 1994 ; Leacock and Chodorow , 1998 ) , information-based ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Jiang and Conrath , 1997 ) or distributional ( Weeds and Weir , 2005 ) .']","['dictionary-based ( Lesk , 1986 ) , ontology-based ( Wu and Palmer , 1994 ; Leacock and Chodorow , 1998 ) , information-based ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Jiang and Conrath , 1997 ) or distributional ( Weeds and Weir , 2005 ) .', 'The knowledge sources used for computing relatedness can be as different as dictionaries, ontologies or large corpora.']","['Various approaches for computing semantic relatedness of words or concepts have been proposed, e.g.', 'dictionary-based ( Lesk , 1986 ) , ontology-based ( Wu and Palmer , 1994 ; Leacock and Chodorow , 1998 ) , information-based ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Jiang and Conrath , 1997 ) or distributional ( Weeds and Weir , 2005 ) .', 'The knowledge sources used for computing relatedness can be as different as dictionaries, ontologies or large corpora.']","['Various approaches for computing semantic relatedness of words or concepts have been proposed, e.g.', 'dictionary-based ( Lesk , 1986 ) , ontology-based ( Wu and Palmer , 1994 ; Leacock and Chodorow , 1998 ) , information-based ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Jiang and Conrath , 1997 ) or distributional ( Weeds and Weir , 2005 ) .', 'The knowledge sources used for computing relatedness can be as different as dictionaries, ontologies or large corpora.']","['Various approaches for computing semantic relatedness of words or concepts have been proposed, e.g.', 'dictionary-based ( Lesk , 1986 ) , ontology-based ( Wu and Palmer , 1994 ; Leacock and Chodorow , 1998 ) , information-based ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Jiang and Conrath , 1997 ) or distributional ( Weeds and Weir , 2005 ) .']","['dictionary-based ( Lesk , 1986 ) , ontology-based ( Wu and Palmer , 1994 ; Leacock and Chodorow , 1998 ) , information-based ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Jiang and Conrath , 1997 ) or distributional ( Weeds and Weir , 2005 ) .', 'The knowledge sources used for computing relatedness can be as different as dictionaries, ontologies or large corpora.']"

This paper presents a new conceptual paradigm for performing search in context, that largely automates the search process, providing even non-professional users with highly relevant results. This paradigm is implemented in practice in the IntelliZap system, where search is initiated from a text query marked by the user in a document she views, and is guided by the text surrounding the marked query in that document (""the context""). The context-driven information retrieval process involves semantic keyword extraction and clustering to automatically generate new, augmented queries. The latter are submitted to a host of general and domain-specific search engines. Search results are then semantically reranked, using context.

Two groups of English and Chinese verbs are examined to show that lexical selection must be based on interpretation of the sentence as well as selection restrictions placed on the verb arguments. A novel representation scheme is suggested, and is compared to representations with selection restrictions used in transfer-based MT. We see our approach as closely aligned with knowledge-based MT approaches (KBMT), and as a separate component that could be incorporated into existing systems. Examples and experimental results will show that, using this scheme, inexact matches can achieve correct lexical selection.Comment: 6 pages, Figures and bib files are in part","dictionary-based ( Lesk , 1986 ) , ontology-based ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Leacock and Chodorow , 1998 ) , information-based ( Resnik , 1995 ; Jiang and Conrath , 1997 ) or distributional ( Weeds and Weir , 2005 ) .","['Various approaches for computing semantic relatedness of words or concepts have been proposed, e.g.', 'dictionary-based ( Lesk , 1986 ) , ontology-based ( #AUTHOR_TAG ; Leacock and Chodorow , 1998 ) , information-based ( Resnik , 1995 ; Jiang and Conrath , 1997 ) or distributional ( Weeds and Weir , 2005 ) .', 'The knowledge sources used for computing relatedness can be as different as dictionaries, ontologies or large corpora.']",0,"['Resnik (1995) reported a correlation of r=.9026. 10', '#AUTHOR_TAG reported a correlation of r = .9026.10 The results are not directly comparable , because he only used noun-noun pairs , words instead of concepts , a much smaller dataset , and measured semantic similarity instead of semantic relatedness .']","['#AUTHOR_TAG reported a correlation of r = .9026.10 The results are not directly comparable , because he only used noun-noun pairs , words instead of concepts , a much smaller dataset , and measured semantic similarity instead of semantic relatedness .']","['Resnik (1995) reported a correlation of r=.9026. 10', '#AUTHOR_TAG reported a correlation of r = .9026.10 The results are not directly comparable , because he only used noun-noun pairs , words instead of concepts , a much smaller dataset , and measured semantic similarity instead of semantic relatedness .']","['This correlation coefficient is an upper bound of performance for automatic SR measures applied on the same dataset.', 'Resnik (1995) reported a correlation of r=.9026. 10', '#AUTHOR_TAG reported a correlation of r = .9026.10 The results are not directly comparable , because he only used noun-noun pairs , words instead of concepts , a much smaller dataset , and measured semantic similarity instead of semantic relatedness .']","['#AUTHOR_TAG reported a correlation of r = .9026.10 The results are not directly comparable , because he only used noun-noun pairs , words instead of concepts , a much smaller dataset , and measured semantic similarity instead of semantic relatedness .']","['This correlation coefficient is an upper bound of performance for automatic SR measures applied on the same dataset.', 'Resnik (1995) reported a correlation of r=.9026. 10', '#AUTHOR_TAG reported a correlation of r = .9026.10 The results are not directly comparable , because he only used noun-noun pairs , words instead of concepts , a much smaller dataset , and measured semantic similarity instead of semantic relatedness .']","['Resnik (1995) reported a correlation of r=.9026. 10', '#AUTHOR_TAG reported a correlation of r = .9026.10 The results are not directly comparable , because he only used noun-noun pairs , words instead of concepts , a much smaller dataset , and measured semantic similarity instead of semantic relatedness .']","['The summarized inter-subject correlation between 21 subjects was r=.478 (cf.  is statistically significant at p < .05.', 'This correlation coefficient is an upper bound of performance for automatic SR measures applied on the same dataset.', 'Resnik (1995) reported a correlation of r=.9026. 10', '#AUTHOR_TAG reported a correlation of r = .9026.10 The results are not directly comparable , because he only used noun-noun pairs , words instead of concepts , a much smaller dataset , and measured semantic similarity instead of semantic relatedness .']","['#AUTHOR_TAG reported a correlation of r = .9026.10 The results are not directly comparable , because he only used noun-noun pairs , words instead of concepts , a much smaller dataset , and measured semantic similarity instead of semantic relatedness .', 'Finkelstein et al.

Although such systems seem deceptively simple, a considerable amount of skill is required in order to satisfy non-trivial information needs. This paper presents a new conceptual paradigm for performing search in context, that largely automates the search process, providing even non-professional users with highly relevant results. This paradigm is implemented in practice in the IntelliZap system, where search is initiated from a text query marked by the user in a document she views, and is guided by the text surrounding the marked query in that document (""the context"").

We present a new method for computing semantic relatedness of concepts. The method relies solely on the structure of a conceptual network and eliminates the need for performing additional corpus analysis. The network structure is employed to generate artificial conceptual glosses. They replace textual definitions proper written by humans and are processed by a dictionary based metric of semantic relatedness [1]. We implemented the metric on the basis of GermaNet, the German counterpart of WordNet, and evaluated the results on a German dataset of 57 word pairs rated by human subjects for their semantic relatedness.

CC1519,W06-1705,Annotated web as corpus,linguistic search engine,['A Kilgarriff'],related work,"Users of search engines often have specific questions which they hope or believe a particular resource can answer. The problem, from the computer system's perspective, is cognitive understanding of the contents in the source and finding the desired answer. Most of the search engines, with Google on the top, able to retrieve most likely relevant information based on a query. But not capable of providing answer to a question due to lack of deduction capability. In order to find a specific answer to a question, the engine needs to understand the information content and able to do deductive reasoning. Conventional information representation models used in the search engines rely on an extensive use of keywords and their frequencies in storing and retrieving information and other characteristic data on specific body of information. It is believed that we need new approaches for the development of future search engines which will be more effective. Semantic model is an alternative to conventional approach. We have proposed logical-linguistic model where logic and linguistic formalism are used in providing mechanism for computer to understand the contents of the source and deduce answers to questions. The capability of deduction is much depended on the knowledge representation framework used. The approach applies semantic analysis in transforming and normalising information from natural language texts into a declarative knowledge based representation of first order predicate logic. Retrieval of relevant information can then be performed through plausible logical implication and answer to query is carried out using a theorem proving technique.

Starting from the assumption that every interlanguage is characterized by a 'unique matrix of frequencies of various linguistic forms' (Krzeszowski 1990: 212), we have submitted two similar-sized corpora of native and non-native writing to a lexical frequency software program to uncover some of the distinguishing features of learner writing. The non-native speaker corpus is taken from the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE) database. It consists of argumentative essay writing by advanced French-speaking learners of English. The control corpus of similar writing is taken from the Louvain Corpus of Native English Essays (LOCNESS) database. Though limited to one specific type of interlanguage, the approach presented here is applicable to any learner variety and demonstrates a potential of automatic profiling for revealing the stylistic characteristics of EFL texts. In the present study, the learner data is shown to display many of the stylistic features of spoken, rather than written, English.","In addition , the advantages of using linguistically annotated data over raw data are well documented ( Mair , 2005 ;

CC1528,W06-1705,Annotated web as corpus,an introduction to corpus linguistics,['G Kennedy'],introduction,"On first looking into a corpus, teachers as well as students may well be blinded by the sheer scale of the resource and by the possibilities for research that it offers. As the author of this book puts it, ""The research topics in a machine-readable cor pus are potentially as various and wide ranging as are the facts about a language and the use of that language"" (274). The value of this book is that it provides practical examples of the range of research possibilities that a corpus offers, as well as indi cating how corpus-based research projects may be undertaken. It is informed throughout by the view that corpus linguistics is not a separate branch of linguistics, but rather ""descriptive linguistics aided by new technology"" (268). There is some theoretical discussion of the place of corpus linguistics in the wider field, but in general, the author's approach is to let the results speak for themselves. The author's declared aim is to whet the appetites of teachers and students, and in this he clearly succeeds. In the ""Introduction,"" the author suggests that some readers might usefully begin with chapter 3, ""Corpus-Based Descriptions of English."" This is the central part of the book and by far the most valuable in terms of whetting the appetite. It consists of a very comprehensive and wide-ranging review of previous corpus-based research, divided into the following sections: lexical description, grammatical studies cen tered on morphemes or words, grammatical studies centered on the sentence, pragmatics and spoken discourse, and studies of variation. The first section of the chapter investigates how computerized corpora are increasingly being used in lexi cography and continues with a review of collocational studies based on the LOB corpus, as well as work by Sinclair and Renouf on collocational frameworks.
