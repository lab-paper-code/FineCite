CC1,158977742,Ontology-Based Recommendation of Editorial Products,Thiviyan Thanapalasingam,Web search personalization with ontological user profiles,"[""A Sieg"", ""B Mobasher"", ""R Burke""]",Every user has a distinct background and a specific goal when searching for information on the Web. The goal of Web search personalization is to tailor search results to a particular user based on that user's interests and preferences. Effective personalization of information access involves two important challenges: accurately identifying the user context and organizing the information in such a way that matches the particular context. We present an approach to personalized search that involves building models of user context as ontological profiles by assigning implicitly derived interest scores to existing concepts in a domain ontology. A spreading activation algorithm is used to maintain the interest scores based on the user's ongoing behavior. Our experiments show that re-ranking the search results based on the interest scores and the semantic evidence in an ontological user profile is effective in presenting the most relevant results to the user.,They usually generate user models that describe user interests according to a set of features #AUTHOR_TAG.,"['Content-based recommender systems [15] rely on a pre-existing domain knowledge to suggest items more similar to the ones that the user seems to like.', 'They usually generate user models that describe user interests according to a set of features #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'With the advent of the Semantic Web, several recommender systems started to adopt ontologies for representing both user interests and items [17].', 'Often these systems use an ontology so that, given user interest in an item represented in the ontology, they can then propagate such interest to relevant items and concepts.', 'For example, given a positive feedback on ""beagles"", a system may infer (correctly or not) that a user is interested in ""dogs"", and more generally in ""pets"".', 'SBR exploits a similar mechanism when it infers that a publication explicitly linked to a topic (e.g., Linked Data) is also about its skos:broaderGeneric concepts in CSO (e.g., Semantic Web).', 'The main advantages of these solutions are', 'i) the ability to exploit the domain knowledge for improving the user modelling process,', 'ii) the ability to share and reuse system knowledge, and', 'iii) the alleviation of the cold-start and data sparsity problems [16,18].']",5,"['They usually generate user models that describe user interests according to a set of features #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'With the advent of the Semantic Web, several recommender systems started to adopt ontologies for representing both user interests and items [17].']"

To address this gap we have developed a novel tool, Rexplore, which integrates statistical analysis, semantic technologies, and visual analytics to provide effective support for exploring and making sense of scholarly data.

In order to make sense of and explore this large-scale body of knowledge we need an accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date ontology of research topics. Unfortunately, human crafted classifications do not satisfy these criteria, as they evolve too slowly and tend to be too coarse-grained. Current automated methods for generating ontologies of research areas also present a number of limitations, such as: i) they do not consider the rich amount of indirect statistical and semantic relationships, which can help to understand the relation between two topics - e.g., the fact that two research areas are associated with a similar set of venues or technologies; ii) they do not distinguish between different kinds of hierarchical relationships; and iii) they are not able to handle effectively ambiguous topics characterized by a noisy set of relationships. In this paper we present Klink-2, a novel approach which improves on our earlier work on automatic generation of semantic topic networks and addresses the aforementioned limitations by taking advantage of a variety of knowledge sources available on the web. In particular, Klink-2 analyses networks of research entities (including papers, authors, venues, and technologies) to infer three kinds of semantic relationships between topics. It also identifies ambiguous keywords (e.g., ""ontology"") and separates them into the appropriate distinct topics - e.g., ""ontology/philosophy"" vs. ""ontology/semantic web"".

Typically, a technology is expected to originate in the context of a research area and then spread and contribute to several other fields.

Unfortunately, the spreading of technologies across research areas may be a slow and inefficient process, since it is easy for researchers to be unaware of potentially relevant solutions produced by other research communities. In this paper, we hypothesise that it is possible to learn typical technology propagation patterns from historical data and to exploit this knowledge i) to anticipate where a technology may be adopted next and ii) to alert relevant stakeholders about emerging and relevant technologies in other fields. To do so, we propose the Technology-Topic Framework, a novel approach which uses a semantically enhanced technology-topic model to forecast the propagation of technologies to research areas.

These ontologies need to evolve regularly in response to changes in the domain and the emergence of new requirements. An important step of this process is the selection of candidate concepts to include in the new version of the ontology. This operation needs to take into account a variety of factors and in particular reconcile user requirements and application performance. Current ontology evolution methods focus either on ranking concepts according to their relevance or on preserving compatibility with existing applications.  However, they do not take in consideration the impact of the ontology evolution process on the performance of computational tasks - e.g., in this work we focus on instance tagging, similarity computation, generation of recommendations, and data clustering. In this paper, we propose the Pragmatic Ontology Evolution (POE) framework, a novel approach for selecting from a group of candidates a set of concepts able to produce a new version of a given ontology that i) is consistent with the a set of user requirements (e.g., max number of concepts in the ontology), ii) is parametrised with respect to a number of dimensions (e.g., topological considerations), and iii) effectively supports relevant computational tasks. Our approach also supports users in navigating the space of possible solutions by showing how certain choices, such as limiting the number of concepts or privileging trendy concepts rather than historical ones, would reflect on the application performance.

Study 1 (N = 120) and Study 2 (N = 83) used daily diaries as a method to encourage individuals ""to see the unseen."" Results revealed that encouraging women to pay attention to sexism, in comparison to attention to other social interactions, led to a stronger rejection of Modern Sexist, Neosexist, and Benevolent Sexist beliefs (Studies 1 and 2) and to negative evaluations of Modern and Benevolent Sexist men described in profiles as well as to more engagement in collective action on behalf of women (Study 2). In contrast, for men, paying attention to sexism did not have these effects. Results from Study 2 suggest, and from Study 3 (N = 141) confirm, that menÕs endorsement of Modern and Neosexist beliefs can be reduced if attention to sexism and emotional empathy for the target of discrimination is encouraged. Finally, a follow-up survey indicated that the attitude change in women and men was stable over time. The implications of these findings for interventions to reduce womenÕs versus menÕs endorsement of sexist beliefs are discussed.","Everyday sexism rests on the concept that sexism is either faced or reproduced on a daily basis but is rarely noticed (Barreto et al., 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG and Swim, 2011).","['Everyday sexism rests on the concept that sexism is either faced or reproduced on a daily basis but is rarely noticed (Barreto et al., 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG and Swim, 2011).', ""Identifying everyday sexism and its different forms, empathising with other people's experiences, and reflecting on them are seen as possible ways to contribute to gender equality (Becker and Swim, 2011;Zawadzki et al., 2013)."", 'More particularly, using everyday experiences to reflect on them is an important stepping stone in the history of feminism (Freedman, 2014;Sarachild, 1968).']",5,"['Everyday sexism rests on the concept that sexism is either faced or reproduced on a daily basis but is rarely noticed (Barreto et al., 2009;#AUTHOR_TAG and Swim, 2011).', ""Identifying everyday sexism and its different forms, empathising with other people's experiences, and reflecting on them are seen as possible ways to contribute to gender equality (Becker and Swim, 2011;Zawadzki et al., 2013).""]"
CC23,211273841,Co-designing Cards on Social Issues for Creating Educational Games,Christina Myers,Heritage: having a say,"[""F Kensing"", ""J Greenbaum""]","The roots of Participatory Design are deep and broad. We begin here in the 1970s when progressive ideas spread from the society at large into emerging computer system development in the workplace. This early heritage is intriguing in many ways because the seeds of later participatory approaches have inherited some of the victories of earlier projects as well as some of the continuing challenges. This chapter lays out some of the struggles in the history of the now maturing Ð after more than four decades of growth Ð Þeld of Participatory Design. We discuss some of the lessons learned in the 1970s and 1980s as we address the following questions: What motivated initial projects for choosing a Participatory Design approach? What was in fact designed? How may the heritage be conceptualised? What does the heritage have to o_er to those who strive to apply Participatory Design inspired approaches today? Our focus is on Participatory Design action projects where the needs of groups of workers drove researchers to take note of how previously unheard voices could be important in design of technologies. These early projects are discussed within the political context of the 1960s, 70s and 80s, a cold war environment that gave rise to the importance of strong voices speaking out on social issues that a_ected groups with access to fewer resources. The chapter takes us up to the Þrst Participatory Design Conference in 1990, where the ideas and practices in the early period began to be pulled together into a coherent set of principles. The following chapters will cover later developments within Participatory Design. We start in Scandinavia in the 1970s with some exemplary cases of projects with what was then known as data processing. In some ways it is no surprise that the heritage discussed here starts in places where trade unions and collective bargaining were strong and able to inßuence power relations in the workplace. These cases involved trade union activists who sought ways to inßuence the fast-paced automation that was emerging on their shop ßoor. The early trade union work set out to ask systems researchers as ÔexpertsÕ to help them better cope with workplace problems Ð and indeed Participatory Design helped the workers do this, but it also ßipped the project on its ear by introducing the system designers to a whole new set of problems. We then proceed with a short introduction to another strong inspiration for Participatory Design Ð ethnographic studies about the introduction of technology into workplaces. These types of studies gave voice to o_ce workers and technicians as they experienced the consequences of workplace change. Chapter 5 gives more detail about the ethnographic approach. Finally, the chapter provides an overview of some of the main theoretical roots of participation; a topic that will be further explored in Chapter 3. The more speciÞc principles, practices and techniques that Participatory Design has provided may be Ð and have indeed been Ð used for other purposes and with other intentions. Understanding and appreciating the theoretical roots of participation are seen as necessary for obtaining what this chapter will begin to describe as genuine participation. And we conclude with some principles we feel are instrumental for carrying out contemporary, genuine and action-based Participatory Design. While this book describes concepts and practices a_ecting tools that are applied now to a wide range of digital artefacts Ð going well beyond the workplace Ð this chapter focuses on the workoriented heritage of this Þeld. But the lessons learned bear repeating, as without history we are often left to repeat some of the same mistakes Ð and as we know too well, the challenges of multi-party participation combined with constantly changing technologies are fertile ground for making mistakes! The participatory perspective we introduce here brings those issues back up to the surface. The need for participation, in essence, recognises that tensions exist between those with some form of knowledge and power and those without. Kensing (1983) argues that basic requirements for genuine participation include access to information, resources (time, money and expert assistance) and the power to inßuence decisions. In an extensive review of Participatory Design projects, Clement and van den Besselaar (1993) suggest further that appropriate participatory development methods and organisational and technical ßexibility are also needed.","For supporting the design of cards, #AUTHOR_TAG and Greenbaum (2012) proposed some participatory design principles for transcribing diversified experiences and knowledge to the cards.","['Within the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) literature, cards have been pointed out as a tool with the potential to democratise knowledge and to support collaborative design of realistic and innovative projects.', 'Chow et al.

In this paper, we take a computational approach to analyze the content of reports. We use topic-modelling techniques to extract emerging topics and concepts from the reports, and to map the semantic relations between those topics. The resulting picture closely resembles and adds to that arrived at through qualitative analysis, showing that this form of topic modeling could be useful for sifting through datasets that had not previously been subject to any analysis. More precisely, we come up with a map of topics for two different resolutions of our topic model and discuss the connection between the identified topics.

Filling this gap is one of the main aims of the Games and Learning Alliance (http://www.galanoe.eu) European Network of Excellence on Serious Games, which has a focus upon pedagogy-driven SGs. This paper relies on the assumption that the fundamental aspect of SG design consists in the translation of learning goals/practices into mechanical element of gameplay, serving to an instructional purpose beside that of play and fun. This paper proposes the Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) model, which supports SG analysis and design by allowing reflection on the various pedagogical and game elements in an SG. The LM-GM model includes a set of pre-defined game mechanics and pedagogical elements that we have abstracted from literature on game studies and learning theories.    Designers and analysts can exploit these mechanics to draw the LM-GM map for a game, so as to identify and highlight its main pedagogical and entertainment features, and their interrelations. The tool may also be useful for teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of a given game and better understand how to implement it in educational settings. A case study is reported to illustrate the framework's support in determining how gameplay and pedagogy intertwine in an SG.

A Meta-Analysis,"[""Ann DeSmet"", ""Debbe Thompson"", ""Tom Baranowski"", ""Antonio Palmeira"", ""Ma\u00eft\u00e9 Verloigne"", ""Ilse De Bourdeaudhuij""]","Serious digital games can be effective at changing healthy lifestyles, but large differences in their effectiveness exist. The extent of user involvement in game design may contribute to game effectiveness by creating a better fit with user preferences. Participatory design (PD), which represents active user involvement as informant (ie, users are asked for input and feedback) or codesigner (ie, users as equal partners in the design) early on and throughout the game development, may be associated with higher game effectiveness, as opposed to no user involvement or limited user involvement.This paper reports the results of a meta-analysis examining the moderating role of PD in the effectiveness of serious digital games for healthy lifestyle promotion.Four databases were searched for peer-reviewed papers in English that were published or in press before October 2014, using a (group-) randomized controlled trial design. Effectiveness data were derived from another meta-analysis assessing the role of behavior change techniques and game features in serious game effectiveness.A total of 58 games evaluated in 61 studies were included. As previously reported, serious digital games had positive effects on healthy lifestyles and their determinants. Unexpectedly, PD (g=0.075, 95% CI 0.017 to 0.133) throughout game development was related to lower game effectiveness on behavior (Q=6.74, P<.05) than when users were only involved as testers (g=0.520, 95% CI 0.150 to 0.890, P<.01). Games developed with PD (g=0.171, 95% CI 0.061 to 0.281, P<.01) were also related to lower game effectiveness on self-efficacy (Q=7.83, P<.05) than when users were not involved in game design (g=0.384, 95% CI 0.283 to 0.485, P<.001). Some differences were noted depending on age group, publication year of the study, and on the specific role in PD (ie, informant or codesigner), and depending on the game design element. Games developed with PD were more effective in changing behavioral determinants when they included users in design elements on game dynamics (beta=.215, 95% CI .075 to .356, P<.01) and, more specifically, as an informant (beta=.235, 95% CI .079 to .329, P<.01). Involving users as informants in PD to create game levels was also related to higher game effectiveness (Q=7.02, P<.01). Codesign was related to higher effectiveness when used to create the game challenge (Q=11.23, P<.01), but to lower game effectiveness when used to create characters (Q=4.36, P<.05) and the game world (Q=3.99, P<.05).The findings do not support higher effectiveness of games developed with PD. However, significant differences existed among PD games. More support was found for informant roles than for codesign roles. When PD was applied to game dynamics, levels, and game challenge, this was associated with higher effectiveness than when it was applied to game aesthetics. Since user involvement may have an important influence on reach, adoption, and implementation of the intervention, further research and design efforts are needed to enhance effectiveness of serious games developed with PD.","Yet, it represents a challenge as best practices to co-design such games, which require technical, conceptual and educational skills, still have to be defined (Carvalho et al., 2015;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2016).","['Applying co-design to educational games has the potential to generate more effective educational outcomes.', 'Yet, it represents a challenge as best practices to co-design such games, which require technical, conceptual and educational skills, still have to be defined (Carvalho et al., 2015;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2016).', 'Most of the participatory models to design educational games are founded on educational theories and game design (see for example: Amory, 2007; Arnab et al., 2015).', 'Some more recent models, though, have also included domain experts to define the learning content of the educational game (De Jans et al., 2017).', 'In scenarios where the co-designers are not equally experienced with the educational game domain or with the design process, tools to facilitate the design and maximize educational outcomes may be required.']",0,"['Yet, it represents a challenge as best practices to co-design such games, which require technical, conceptual and educational skills, still have to be defined (Carvalho et al., 2015;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2016).', 'Most of the participatory models to design educational games are founded on educational theories and game design (see for example: Amory, 2007; Arnab et al., 2015).']"

They motivate and enhance players interest in a particular topic, and only require a small time-investment. The games should focus on a single concept or learning goal and should be carefully designed. This study therefore explores the usefulness of informant design when developing such serious mini-games. Informant design is a framework that involves stakeholders at different stages of the design process depending on their expertise, which maximizes the value of their contributions. When developing awareness campaigns, various stakeholders, with different goals, need to be involved. Therefore, this paper suggests the use of informant design to increase the support of every stakeholder. The informant design framework provides an excellent design methodology for games as it is very flexible in time, place and number of participants in the co-design activities. The current study shows a case study indicating the usefulness of informant design when developing serious mini-games to increase advertising literacy among adolescents. Serious mini-games provide an interesting alternative to complex serious games.Informant design can increase the involvement of various stakeholders.A method to use informant design is provided.","Some more recent models, though, have also included domain experts to define the learning content of the educational game (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2017).","['Applying co-design to educational games has the potential to generate more effective educational outcomes.', 'Yet, it represents a challenge as best practices to co-design such games, which require technical, conceptual and educational skills, still have to be defined (Carvalho et al., 2015;DeSmet et al., 2016).', 'Most of the participatory models to design educational games are founded on educational theories and game design (see for example: Amory, 2007; Arnab et al., 2015).', 'Some more recent models, though, have also included domain experts to define the learning content of the educational game (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2017).', 'In scenarios where the co-designers are not equally experienced with the educational game domain or with the design process, tools to facilitate the design and maximize educational outcomes may be required.']",4,"['Applying co-design to educational games has the potential to generate more effective educational outcomes.', 'Yet, it represents a challenge as best practices to co-design such games, which require technical, conceptual and educational skills, still have to be defined (Carvalho et al., 2015;DeSmet et al., 2016).', 'Most of the participatory models to design educational games are founded on educational theories and game design (see for example: Amory, 2007; Arnab et al., 2015).', 'Some more recent models, though, have also included domain experts to define the learning content of the educational game (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2017).', 'In scenarios where the co-designers are not equally experienced with the educational game domain or with the design process, tools to facilitate the design and maximize educational outcomes may be required.']"

Despite this, women are still under-represented in the upper echelons of organizations.In this volume, leading psychologists from the United States, Canada, and the European Union go beyond social commentary, anecdotal evidence and raw statistics to explain and offer remedies for this continued inequality, based on empirical evidence. Subtle barriers to women's advancement to and success in leadership positions are a major focus, such as women being recruited for upper-level positions that are associated with a high risk of failure or women managers being stereotyped as either competent or warm (but not both). Solutions that can be practically implemented are offered at different levels of analysis, including organizational (e.g., affirmative action), work group (e.g., diversity management), and individual (e.g., cross-cultural networking).Other obstacles associated with breaking through the glass ceiling include more nuanced forms of gender stereotyping, tokenism, and sexual harassment. The somewhat surprising effects of affirmative action and family friendly policies are also examined. As this volume explores women's current experiences in the workplace, a critical emphasis is making visible what women encounter as their career trajectory ascends and suggesting how they can enhance their career choices and thrive in the hard-won positions they attain.","Everyday sexism rests on the concept that sexism is either faced or reproduced on a daily basis but is rarely noticed (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009;Becker and Swim, 2011).","['Everyday sexism rests on the concept that sexism is either faced or reproduced on a daily basis but is rarely noticed (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009;Becker and Swim, 2011).', ""Identifying everyday sexism and its different forms, empathising with other people's experiences, and reflecting on them are seen as possible ways to contribute to gender equality (Becker and Swim, 2011;Zawadzki et al., 2013)."", 'More particularly, using everyday experiences to reflect on them is an important stepping stone in the history of feminism (Freedman, 2014;Sarachild, 1968).']",4,"['Everyday sexism rests on the concept that sexism is either faced or reproduced on a daily basis but is rarely noticed (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009;Becker and Swim, 2011).', ""Identifying everyday sexism and its different forms, empathising with other people's experiences, and reflecting on them are seen as possible ways to contribute to gender equality (Becker and Swim, 2011;Zawadzki et al., 2013)."", 'More particularly, using everyday experiences to reflect on them is an important stepping stone in the history of feminism (Freedman, 2014;Sarachild, 1968).']"

The paper also links the PRFS experience with the public management literature, particularly new public management, and understanding of public sector performance evaluation systems. PRFSs were found to be complex, dynamic systems, balancing peer review and metrics, accommodating differences between fields, and involving lengthy consultation with the academic community and transparency in data and results. Although the importance of PRFSs seems based on their distribution of universitiesÕ research funding, this is something of an illusion, and the literature agrees that it is the competition for prestige created by a PRSF that creates powerful incentives within university systems. The literature suggests that under the right circumstances a PRFS will enhance control by professional elites.

Over the period of the REF assessment both research in the UK and its impact on society for the medical, health, biological, agricultural, veterinary and food sciences sectors has been assessed as internationally excellent with a high proportion of submitted activity identified as world-leading. 3. Impact assessment was a new and important dimension of REF2014, to which external assessors from beyond the higher education sector made a much valued contribution. MPA was extremely impressed by the quality and breadth of impact described. MPA believes that the collection of impact case studies provide a unique and powerful illustration of the outstanding contribution that research in the fields covered by this panel is making to health, wellbeing, wealth creation and society within and beyond the UK. 4. MPA noted that basic science undertaken over the last two decades underpinned many of the impact case studies submitted, demonstrating a requirement to continue to invest in basic science and infrastructure over the long term. Members were encouraged that the translational pathway is now much better structured to realise the impact from basic science, but urge continued investment in high quality basic science and science infrastructure to ensure delivery of future impacts. 5. International MPA members considered REF2014 to have been an equitable and impartial process, which has extended from and improved upon the previous Research Assessment Exercise (RAE2008). Specifically, the impact component has served to highlight the considerable significance of research submitted to MPA on the world stage. 6. MPA was encouraged by the number of early career researchers (ECRs) submitted to each of the sub-panels and was distinctly impressed by the quality of their research outputs. However, there was some concern that not enough attention was being paid to their career pathway through to more senior positions. 7.

The MAG is a heterogeneous graph comprised of over 120 million publication entities and related authors, institutions, venues and fields of study. It is also the largest publicly available dataset of citation data. As such, it is an important resource for scholarly communications research. As the dataset is assembled using automatic methods, it is important to understand its strengths and limitations, especially whether there is any noise or bias in the data, before applying it to a particular task. This article studies the characteristics of the dataset and provides a correlation analysis with other publicly available research publication datasets to answer these questions. Our results show that the citation data and publication metadata correlate well with external datasets. The MAG also has very good coverage across different domains with a slight bias towards technical disciplines. On the other hand, there are certain limitations to completeness. Only 30 million papers out of 127 million have some citation data. While these papers have a good mean total citation count that is consistent with expectations, there is some level of noise when extreme values are considered. Other current limitations of MAG are the availability of affiliation information, as only 22 million papers have these data, and the normalisation of institution names.","Additionally, studies by #AUTHOR_TAG and [12] have recently confirmed how comprehensive the MAG citation data are.","['The dataset creation procedure is depicted in Figure 1.', 'We first downloaded the REF 2014 submission list [9].', 'For each output, the list contains; publication title, publication year, publication venue, name of institute and UoA.', 'These fields were We decided to utilise the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) to enrich the REF submission list with citation information.', 'At the time of the experiment MAG contained approximately 168m individual papers and 1.15 billion citation pairs.', 'This decision was motivated by the fact that while Scopus, operated by Elsevier, was used to provide citation data to the REF process, the free version of the Scopus API service is limited to 20,000 requests per week.', 'It would have therefore taken almost two months to gather the required data which was not practical as this was more than 10 times slower than using MAG.', 'Additionally, studies by #AUTHOR_TAG and [12] have recently confirmed how comprehensive the MAG citation data are.', ""We could not utilise Google Scholar as it does not offer an API and prohibits 'scraping' of data.""]",0,"['Additionally, studies by #AUTHOR_TAG and [12] have recently confirmed how comprehensive the MAG citation data are.']"

A sample of articles was evaluated by using both methods and agreement was analyzed by weighted Cohen's kappas. ANVUR presented results as indicating an overall 'good' or 'more than adequate' agreement. This paper re-examines the experiment results according to the available statistical guidelines for interpreting kappa values, by showing that the degree of agreement, always in the range 0.09-0.42 has to be interpreted, for all research fields, as unacceptable, poor or, in a few cases, as, at most, fair. The only notable exception, confirmed also by a statistical meta-analysis, was a moderate agreement for economics and statistics (Area 13) and its sub-fields. We show that the experiment protocol adopted in Area 13 was substantially modified with respect to all the other research fields, to the point that results for economics and statistics have to be considered as fatally flawed. The evidence of a poor agreement supports the conclusion that IR and bibliometrics do not produce similar results, and that the adoption of both methods in the Italian research assessment possibly introduced systematic and unknown biases in its final results. The conclusion reached by ANVUR must be reversed: the available evidence does not justify at all the joint use of IR and bibliometrics within the same research assessment exercise.","It has been shown in [4], #AUTHOR_TAG and that many bibliometric indicators show little correlation with peer review judgments at the article level.","['It has been shown in [4], #AUTHOR_TAG and that many bibliometric indicators show little correlation with peer review judgments at the article level.', 'This study, and those by [7], [2] and [3], demonstrate that some bibliometric measures can offer a surprisingly high degree of accuracy when used at the institutional or departmental level.', 'Our work has been conducted on a significantly larger dataset and our prediction accuracy is higher than shown in previous studies, despite deliberately using fairly simplistic indicators.']",0,"['It has been shown in [4], #AUTHOR_TAG and that many bibliometric indicators show little correlation with peer review judgments at the article level.']"

We argue that procedures currently used by many professional journals, such as blind or masked review, may not completely alleviate the effects of these pitfalls. Instead, we suggest that increasing reviewers' awareness of the pitfalls, accountability, and vigilance can improve fairness in the peer review process. The ultimate responsibilities belong to the journal editors who are confronted with the difficult task of satisfying journal readers, contributors, reviewers, and owners.

When something is peer reviewed it is in some sense blessed. Even journalists recognize this. When the BMJ published a highly controversial paper that argued that a new `disease', female sexual dysfunction, was in some ways being created by pharmaceutical companies, a friend who is a journalist was very excitedÑnot least because reporting it gave him a chance to get sex onto the front page of a highly respectable but somewhat priggish newspaper (the Financial Times). `But,' the news editor wanted to know, `was this paper peer reviewed?'. The implication was that if it had been it was good enough for the front page and if it had not been it was not. Well, had it been? I had read it much more carefully than I read many papers and had asked the author, who happened to be a journalist, to revise the paper and produce more evidence.

Based on the complete and verified publication list of a university, the coverage of MA was assessed and compared with two benchmark databases, Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), on the level of individual publications. Citation counts were analyzed, and issues related to data retrieval and data quality were examined. A Perl script was written to retrieve metadata from MA based on publication titles. The script is freely available on GitHub. We find that MA covers journal articles, working papers, and conference items to a substantial extent and indexes more document types than the benchmark databases (e.g., working papers, dissertations). MA clearly surpasses Scopus and WoS in covering book-related document types and conference items but falls slightly behind Scopus in journal articles. The coverage of MA is favorable for evaluative bibliometrics in most research fields, including economics/business, computer/information sciences, and mathematics. However, MA shows biases similar to Scopus and WoS with regard to the coverage of the humanities, non-English publications, and open-access publications. Rank correlations of citation counts are high between MA and the benchmark databases. We find that the publication year is correct for 89.5% of all publications and the number of authors is correct for 95.1% of the journal articles. Given the fast and ongoing development of MA, we conclude that MA is on the verge of becoming a bibliometric superpower.

In 2003, North America emitted nearly two billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. North AmericaÕs fossil fuel emissions in 2003 (1856 million metric tons of carbon ±10% with 95% certainty) were 27% of global emissions. Approximately 85% of those emissions were from the United States, 9% from Canada and 6% from Mexico. The conversion of fossil fuels to energy (primarily electricity) is the single largest contributor, accounting for approximately 42% of North American fossil emissions in 2003. Transportation is the second largest, accounting for 31% of total emissions. There are also globally important carbon sinks in North America. In 2003, growing vegetation in North America removed approximately 530 million tons of carbon per year (± 50%) from the atmosphere and stored it as plant material and soil organic matter. This land sink is equivalent to approximately 30% of the fossil fuel emissions from North America. The imbalance between the fossil fuel source and the sink on land is a net release to the atmosphere of 1335 million metric tons of carbon per year(± 25%). Approximately 50% of North AmericaÕs terrestrial sink is due to the regrowth of forests in the United States on former agricultural land that was last cultivated decades ago, and on timber land recovering from harvest. Other sinks are relatively small and not well quantified with uncertainties of 100% or more. The future of the North American terrestrial sink is also highly uncertain. The contribution of forest regrowth is expected to decline as the maturing forests grow more slowly and take up less carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. But, this expectation is surrounded by uncertainty because how regrowing forests and other sinks will respond to changes in climate and carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is highly uncertain. The large difference between current sources and sinks and the expectation that the difference could become larger if the growth of fossil fuel emissions continues and land sinks decline suggest that addressing imbalances in the North American carbon budget will likely require actions focused on reducing fossil fuel emissions. Options to enhance sinks (growing forests or sequestering carbon in agricultural soils) can contribute, but enhancing sinks alone is likely insufficient to deal with either the current or future imbalance. Options to reduce emissions include efficiency improvement, fuel switching, and technologies such as carbon capture and geological storage. Implementing these options will likely require both voluntary and policy-driven mechanisms at local, regional, national, and international levels. Meeting the demand for information by decision makers will likely require new modes of research characterized by close collaboration between scientists and carbon management stakeholders.","The State of the Carbon Cycle Report established that North America is a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere, due to fossil-fuel emissions and that there are globally important carbon sinks whose future are highly uncertain (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007).","[""The NACP was formally recognized by the United States in 2002 under the mantle of the nation's overall climate change management strategy (Wofsy and Harriss, 2002)."", 'The first implementation plan for the NACP put forward a research agenda that was centered on quantifying and understanding carbon sinks and sources in North America and surrounding oceans, and the integration of such information into socially, economically, and politically relevant decision-support systems (Sarmiento and Wofsy, 1999;Wofsy and Harriss, 2002).', 'The State of the Carbon Cycle Report established that North America is a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere, due to fossil-fuel emissions and that there are globally important carbon sinks whose future are highly uncertain (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007).', 'Understanding how humans both experience and influence the carbon cycle and climate change is critical to the interests of decision makers (Bernabo, 1995;Feldman and Ingram, 2009), such as those who confer support upon the member agencies of the NACP through funding and other resources.']",0,"['The State of the Carbon Cycle Report established that North America is a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere, due to fossil-fuel emissions and that there are globally important carbon sinks whose future are highly uncertain (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007).']"

Knowledge networks are valuable strategies to put climate information to use. They overcome barriers to information adoption such as stovepipes, pipelines, and restricted decision space, and they can be responsive to issues of salience and the hurdles of reliability, credibility, and trust. Collaboration and adaptive management efforts among resource managers and forecast producers with differing missions show that mutual learning informed by climate information can occur among scientists of different disciplinary backgrounds and between scientists and water managers. The authors show how, through construction of knowledge networks and their institutionalization through boundary organizations focused on salient problems, climate information can positively affect water resources decision making.","Understanding how humans both experience and influence the carbon cycle and climate change is critical to the interests of decision makers (Bernabo, 1995;#AUTHOR_TAG and Ingram, 2009), such as those who confer support upon the member agencies of the NACP through funding and other resources.","[""The NACP was formally recognized by the United States in 2002 under the mantle of the nation's overall climate change management strategy (Wofsy and Harriss, 2002)."", 'The first implementation plan for the NACP put forward a research agenda that was centered on quantifying and understanding carbon sinks and sources in North America and surrounding oceans, and the integration of such information into socially, economically, and politically relevant decision-support systems (Sarmiento and Wofsy, 1999;Wofsy and Harriss, 2002).', 'The State of the Carbon Cycle Report established that North America is a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere, due to fossil-fuel emissions and that there are globally important carbon sinks whose future are highly uncertain (King et al., 2007).', 'Understanding how humans both experience and influence the carbon cycle and climate change is critical to the interests of decision makers (Bernabo, 1995;#AUTHOR_TAG and Ingram, 2009), such as those who confer support upon the member agencies of the NACP through funding and other resources.']",0,"['Understanding how humans both experience and influence the carbon cycle and climate change is critical to the interests of decision makers (Bernabo, 1995;#AUTHOR_TAG and Ingram, 2009), such as those who confer support upon the member agencies of the NACP through funding and other resources.']"

We propose here an extension of the most basic notions used nowadays to analyse large one-mode networks (the classical case) to the two-mode case. To achieve this, we introduce a set of simple statistics, which we discuss by comparing their values on a representative set of real-world networks and on their random versions. This makes it possible to evaluate their relevance in capturing properties of interest in two-mode networks.","If all the nodes in the neighborhood of a scientist-node are connected to other scientist-nodes of that neighborhood, then the clustering coefficient of that neighborhood will be 1; if none of the other nodes in the neighborhood are connected to each other then the clustering coefficient will be zero (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008).","['The average clustering coefficient is a measure of how connected a neighborhood of nodes are.', 'For a particular node (scientist), a neighborhood is all nodes connected to this particular node.', 'If all the nodes in the neighborhood of a scientist-node are connected to other scientist-nodes of that neighborhood, then the clustering coefficient of that neighborhood will be 1; if none of the other nodes in the neighborhood are connected to each other then the clustering coefficient will be zero (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008).', 'In other words, the clustering coefficient of a node that has at least one other node connected to it, is the probability that any two randomly chosen neighbors are connected.', 'This probability is calculated by dividing the number of triangles containing our particular scientist by the number of possible connections between his neighbors (31).', 'The average clustering coefficient is the average of these scores over all the neighborhoods.']",5,"['The average clustering coefficient is a measure of how connected a neighborhood of nodes are.', 'For a particular node (scientist), a neighborhood is all nodes connected to this particular node.', 'If all the nodes in the neighborhood of a scientist-node are connected to other scientist-nodes of that neighborhood, then the clustering coefficient of that neighborhood will be 1; if none of the other nodes in the neighborhood are connected to each other then the clustering coefficient will be zero (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2008).', 'In other words, the clustering coefficient of a node that has at least one other node connected to it, is the probability that any two randomly chosen neighbors are connected.', 'This probability is calculated by dividing the number of triangles containing our particular scientist by the number of possible connections between his neighbors (31).', 'The average clustering coefficient is the average of these scores over all the neighborhoods.']"

One of the most sensitive detection methods is optimization of the quality function known as ""modularity"" over the possible divisions of a network, but direct application of this method using, for instance, simulated annealing is computationally costly. Here we show that the modularity can be reformulated in terms of the eigenvectors of a new characteristic matrix for the network, which we call the modularity matrix, and that this reformulation leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of better quality than competing methods in noticeably shorter running times.

The field of network analysis has attracted interest from scholars coming from a wide range of disciplines as it provides valuable theoretical and methodological toolkits to investigate complex systems of social relations. Furthermore, network theories and methods can examine dynamics present at multiple levels of analysis, from individual- to global-levels. As a result, network analysis has been applied to various contexts of social science research such as social interactions, organizational communication, and crisis response collaboration. In this thesis, I present substantive insights into the application of several network analysis theories and applications to the (1) social, (2) organizational, and (3) crisis response settings. For the context of social interactions, I expand structural balance evaluation to signed and directed networks, and apply this approach to examine 12 social networks. For the context of organizational communication, I demonstrate the application of multilevel modeling for egocentric networks to examine factors associated with the formation of interdisciplinary ties in a scientific organization. In addition, I leverage an extended version of structural balance evaluation for signed and directed networks to examine the sources of tension present in three organizational networks. Third, I provide a case study of response dynamics during the 2010 Haiti earthquake by examining collaboration networks prescribed by national guidelines for response, and interaction networks of the actual collaborations that took place during the earthquake response. Altogether, this work contributes to the growing literature on the theories and applications of network analysis to real-world social networks.

(1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 70, 3240-3244]. This extraordinary value was due to the union of still scarce knowledge of the new research techniques and genius and vision to apply them in novel, valuable ways. As in other sciences, star bioscientists were very protective of their techniques, ideas, and discoveries in the early years of the revolution, tending to collaborate more within their own institution, which slowed diffusion to other scientists. Close, bench-level working ties between stars and firm scientists were needed to accomplish commercialization of the breakthroughs. Where and when star scientists were actively producing publications is a key predictor of where and when commercial firms began to use biotechnology. The extent of collaboration by a firm's scientists with stars is a powerful predictor of its success: for an average firm, 5 articles coauthored by an academic star and the firm's scientists result in about 5 more products in development, 3.5 more products on the market, and 860 more employees. Articles by stars collaborating with or employed by firms have significantly higher rates of citation than other articles by the same or other stars. The U.S. scientific and economic infrastructure has been particularly effective in fostering and commercializing the bioscientific revolution.

This coupled model was forced by observed CO2 emissions for the 1860-1990 period and by the IPCC SRES-A2 emission scenario for the 1991-2100 period. During the historical period, our simulated Net Primary Production (NPP) and net land uptake (NEP) are comparable to the observations in term of trend and variability. By the end of the 21st century, we show that the global NEP is reduced by 56% due to the climate change. In the tropics, increasing temperature, through an increase of evapotranspiration, acts to reduce the soil water content, which leads to a 80% reduction of net land CO2 uptake. As a consequence, tropical carbon storage saturates by the end of the simulation, some regions becoming sources of CO2. On the contrary, in northern high latitudes, increasing temperature stimulates the land biosphere by lengthening the growing season by about 18 days by 2100 which in turn leads to a NEP increase of 11%. Overall, the negative climate impact in the tropics is much larger than the positive impact simulated in the extratropics, therefore, climate change reduce the global land carbon uptake.

As demands for usability become more prevalent for publicly accountable scientific programs, there is a need to better understand opportunities and constraints to science use in order to inform policy design and implementation. Motivated by recent critique of the decision support function of the US Global Change Research Program, this paper seeks to address this issue by specifically examining the production and use of climate science. It reviews empirical evidence from the rich scholarship focused on climate science use, particularly seasonal climate forecasts, to identify factors that constrain or foster usability. It finds, first, that climate science usability is a function both of the context of potential use and of the process of scientific knowledge production itself. Second, nearly every case of successful use of climate knowledge involved some kind of iteration between knowledge producers and users. The paper argues that, rather than an automatic outcome of the call for the production of usable science, iterativity is the result of the action of specific actors and organizations who 'own' the task of building the conditions and mechanisms fostering its creation. Several different types of institutional arrangements can accomplish this task, depending on the needs and resources available. While not all of the factors that enhance usability of science for decision making are within the realm of the scientific enterprise itself, many do offer opportunities for improvement. Science policy mechanisms such as the level of flexibility afforded to research projects and the metrics used to evaluate the outcomes of research investment can be critical to providing the necessary foundation for iterativity and production of usable science to occur.","It is not clear from our analysis that such work is being done yet in the NACP (#AUTHOR_TAG and Lemos, 2011;Lemos et al., 2002).","['However, simply writing papers on relevant topics and forming a tighter research network are not sufficient to produce policy-relevant research.', 'The process of connecting science and decision makers must be undertaken.', 'It is not clear from our analysis that such work is being done yet in the NACP (#AUTHOR_TAG and Lemos, 2011;Lemos et al., 2002).', 'Previous research has shown that just because research is policy relevant, does not mean that policy makers will use it (Cash et al., 2006).', 'Science has to be done in a way that directly engages stakeholders and involves them in setting the research agenda, working with them iteratively over long periods of time to ensure that the research can be more usable in the end.', ""The NACP abstract database doesn't really provide evidence one way or another that that is happening.""]",0,"['It is not clear from our analysis that such work is being done yet in the NACP (#AUTHOR_TAG and Lemos, 2011;Lemos et al., 2002).', 'Previous research has shown that just because research is policy relevant, does not mean that policy makers will use it (Cash et al., 2006).', 'Science has to be done in a way that directly engages stakeholders and involves them in setting the research agenda, working with them iteratively over long periods of time to ensure that the research can be more usable in the end.']"

Thestudy of the carbon cycle involves scientists from manydisciplines: terrestrial ecologists, agriculturalists, oceanog-raphers, energy economists, and atmospheric scientists.A broad community of scientists involved in the studyof the carbon cycle has conducted a multiyear process of scoping, prioritizing, and planning for a comprehensiveand rationalized program of interdisciplinary research inthis area. Working with as many as nine U.S. agencies,the community produced A U.S. Carbon Cycle Science Plan (Sarmiento and Wofsy) in 1999. The plan reflects input of hundreds of prominent scientists and addresses three fun-damental questions:1.What has happened to the carbon dioxide that hasalready been emitted by human activities?2.How do land management and land use, terrestrialecosystem and ocean dynamics, and other factors affectcarbon sources and sinks over time?3.What will be the future atmospheric carbon dioxideand methane concentrations resulting from environ-mental changes, human actions, and past and futureemissions?The Strategic Plan for the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (USGCRP, 2003) envisions six research programelements to address these questions.

First, empirical measurements allow us to uncover the topological measures that characterize the network at a given moment, as well as the time evolution of these quantities.   The results indicate that the network is scale-free, and that the network evolution is governed by preferential attachment, affecting both internal and external links.   However, in contrast with most model predictions the average degree increases in time, and the node separation decreases.

Retrieved 6/21/2006 from http://cluster.cis.drexel.edu/~cchen/citespace/doc/JASIST_CiteSpace_preprint.pdf.This article describes the latest development of a generic approach to detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature. The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science - research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature - an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research front concepts. Kleinberg's burst detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research front concepts. Freeman's betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are: 1) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, 2) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research front concepts and 3) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling and visualization process is implemented in CiteSpace II, a Java application, and applied to the analysis of two research fields: mass extinction (1981-2004) and terrorism (1990-2003). Prominent trends and pivotal points in visualized networks were verified in collaboration with domain experts, who are the authors of pivotal-point articles. Practical implications of the work are discussed.

Food price is one way through which climate change may affect health. The aim of this study of the global and Australian food systems is to provide  a whole-of-system analysis of food price vulnerabilities, highlighting the key pressure points across the food system through which climate change could potentially have the greatest impact on consumer food prices and the implications for population health. We outline areas where there are particular vulnerabilities for food systems and food prices arising from climate change, particularly global commodity prices; agricultural productivity; short term supply shocks; and less direct factors such as input costs and government policies. We use Australia as a high-income country case study to consider these issues in more detail. The complex and dynamic nature of pricing mechanisms makes it difficult to predict precisely how prices will be impacted. Should prices rise disproportionately among healthy foodstuffs compared to less healthy foods there may be adverse health outcomes if less expensive and less healthy foods are substituted. Higher prices will also have equity implications with lower socio-economic groups most impacted given these households currently spend proportionately more of their weekly income on food.

This shortcoming hampers comparison of outcome data among different centers and therapies and over time. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A classification of complications published by one of the authors in 1992 was critically re-evaluated and modified to increase its accuracy and its acceptability in the surgical community. Modifications mainly focused on the manner of reporting life-threatening and permanently disabling complications. The new grading system still mostly relies on the therapy used to treat the complication. The classification was tested in a cohort of 6336 patients who underwent elective general surgery at our institution. The reproducibility and personal judgment of the classification were evaluated through an international survey with 2 questionnaires sent to 10 surgical centers worldwide. RESULTS: The new ranking system significantly correlated with complexity of surgery (P < 0.0001) as well as with the length of the hospital stay (P < 0.0001). A total of 144 surgeons from 10 different centers around the world and at different levels of training returned the survey. Ninety percent of the case presentations were correctly graded. The classification was considered to be simple (92% of the respondents), reproducible (91%), logical (92%), useful (90%), and comprehensive (89%).

Some groups aim to treat the primary tumor only, whereas others include elective lymph nodes (eLNs). eLNs close to the primary tumor are often included unintentionally within the treatment volume, depending on the respective treatment philosophies. We aimed to measure the percentages of anatomical coverage of eLNs by comparing four different contouring guidelines.Planning target volumes (PTVs) were contoured using planning computed tomography (CT) scans of 11 patients with PDAC based on the Oxford, RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), Michigan, and SCALOP (Selective Chemoradiation in Advanced Localised Pancreatic Cancer trial) guidelines. Clinical target volumes (CTVs) included the peripancreatic, para-aortic, paracaval, celiac trunk, superior mesenteric, and portal vein lymph node areas. Volumetric comparisons of the coverage of all eLN regions were conducted to illustrate the differences between the four contouring strategies.The PTV sizes of the RTOG and Oxford guidelines were comparable. The SCALOP and Michigan PTV sizes were similar to each other and significantly smaller than the RTOG and Oxford PTVs. A large variability of eLN coverage was found for the various subregions according to the respective contouring strategies.This is the first study to directly compare the percentage of anatomical coverage of eLNs according to four PTVs in the same patient cohort.

In locally advanced pancreatic cancer this is even more pronounced due to abdominal pain, fatigue, nausea or malnutrition. In the present article, we quantify this frequently observed weight loss and assess its impact on outcome and survival.Data on demographics, biometrics, toxicity and survival were collected for the last 100 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally advanced pancreatic cancer at our department (45.0 Gy and boost up to 54.0 Gy plus concurrent and subsequent gemcitabine), and the subcutaneous fat area at the umbilicus level was measured by computer tomography before and after chemoradiation.After chemoradiation, patients showed a highly statistically significant weight loss and reduction of the subcutaneous fat area. We could determine a very strong correlation of subcutaneous fat area to patient BMI. By categorizing patients according to their BMI based on the WHO classification as slender, normal, overweight and obese, we found improved but not statistically significant survival among obese patients. Accordingly, patients who showed less weight loss tended to survive longer.In this study, patients with pancreatic cancer lost weight during chemoradiation and their subcutaneous fat diminished. Changes in subcutaneous fat area were highly correlated with patients' BMI. Moreover, obese patients and patients who lost less weight had an improved outcome after treatment. Although the extent of weight loss was not significantly correlated with survival, the observed trend warrants greater attention to nutritional status in the future.","Additionally, consequent supportive therapy may explain the improved tolerability of treatment in this trial compared to others avoiding loss of weight which was described to be a negative prognostic factor after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy #AUTHOR_TAG.","['Toxicity of chemoradiotherapy was well manageable in this trial.', 'The well-known risk of biliary stent dysfunction was managed by prompt stent replacement, but was the most frequent reason for severe adverse events.', 'Hematologic toxicity of gemcitabine-based CRT is directly related to radiotherapy volume and, therefore, volumes were strictly limited [31][32][33].', 'Additionally, consequent supportive therapy may explain the improved tolerability of treatment in this trial compared to others avoiding loss of weight which was described to be a negative prognostic factor after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'The patients in this trial were treated with 3D-conformal plans which have recently been shown to be equally effective and not significantly more toxic as IMRT plans in the neoadjuvant setting [35].']",5,"['Additionally, consequent supportive therapy may explain the improved tolerability of treatment in this trial compared to others avoiding loss of weight which was described to be a negative prognostic factor after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy #AUTHOR_TAG.']"

Phase I clinical data indicate that the amount of acute toxicity from the combination of gemcitabine and radiotherapy is strongly related to the dose and schedule of administration of gemcitabine, as well as to the radiation field size.

The rates of R1 resection in the circumferential resection margin (pancreatic transection, medial, posterior, and anterior surfaces) and their prognostic influence on survival were assessed.For PDAC, the R1 rate was 57.1% (48/84) for any margin, 31.0% (26/84) for anterior surface, 42.9% (36/84) for posterior surface, 29.8% (25/84) for medial margin, and 7.1% (3/84) for pancreatic transection margin.

Interventions  Anterior resections (n=465) with low stapled anastomoses (407 total mesorectal excisions), abdominoperineal resections (n=37), Hartmann resections (n=10), local excisions (n=4), and laparotomy only (n=3).

Patients with macroscopically completely removed pancreatic cancer entered the study between July 1998 and December 2004 in 88 hospitals in Germany and Austria. Follow-up ended in September 2012.After stratification for tumor stage, nodal status, and resection status, patients were randomly assigned to either adjuvant gemcitabine treatment (1g/m2 d 1, 8, 15, q 4 weeks) for 6 months or to observation alone.The primary end point was disease-free survival. Secondary end points included treatment safety and overall survival, with overall survival defined as the time from date of randomization to death.

Nine college students serially tested hypotheses concerning a hidden rule by judging its presence or absence in triplets of digits, and revised them on the basis of an exogenous performance feedback. The scaling properties of the transition period between feedback and triplet presentation were investigated with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). DFA showed temporal scale-free dynamics of EEG activity in both feedback conditions for time scales larger than 150 ms. Furthermore, DFA revealed that negative feedback elicits significantly higher scaling exponents than positive feedback.

Ross"", ""Phil Winsor"", ""Paolo Grigolini""]","In this paper we show that both music composition and brain function, as revealed by the electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis, are renewal non-Poisson processes living in the nonergodic dominion. To reach this important conclusion we process the data with the minimum spanning tree method, so as to detect significant events, thereby building a sequence of times, which is the time series to analyze. Then we show that in both cases, EEG and music composition, these significant events are the signature of a non-Poisson renewal process. This conclusion is reached using a technique of statistical analysis recently developed by our group, the aging experiment (AE). First, we find that in both cases the distances between two consecutive events are described by nonexponential histograms, thereby proving the non-Poisson nature of these processes. The corresponding survival probabilities Psi(t) are well fitted by stretched exponentials [Psi(t) proportional, variant exp (-(gammat){alpha}) , with 0.5<alpha<1 .] The second step rests on the adoption of AE, which shows that these are renewal processes. We show that the stretched exponential, due to its renewal character, is the emerging tip of an iceberg, whose underwater part has slow tails with an inverse power law structure with power index mu=1+alpha. Adopting the AE procedure we find that both EEG and music composition yield mu<2. On the basis of the recently discovered complexity matching effect, according to which a complex system S with mu{S}<2 responds only to a complex driving signal P with mu{P}< or =mu{S}, we conclude that the results of our analysis may explain the influence of music on the human brain.","Mittag-Leffler (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007a) scaling, with stretched exponential relaxation ___ exp __�(t/__) _� at microscopic scales (t < __), and asymptotical convergence to an inverse power law Novikov et al., 1997;Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2001;Gong et al., 2002;Freeman et al., 2003;Stam and de Bruin, 2004;Buiatti et al., 2007;van de Ville et al., 2010;Freyer et al., 2012).","['In general, the Markovian approximation does not hold when long time scales of brain activity are considered.', 'The friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent, and the statistics of the driving noise is neither Gaussian (Freyer et al., 2009) nor __-correlated.', 'The dynamics incorporates extended memory and temporal non-locality.', 'Ordinary exponential relaxation is replaced by complex, viz.', 'Mittag-Leffler (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007a) scaling, with stretched exponential relaxation ___ exp __�(t/__) _� at microscopic scales (t < __), and asymptotical convergence to an inverse power law Novikov et al., 1997;Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2001;Gong et al., 2002;Freeman et al., 2003;Stam and de Bruin, 2004;Buiatti et al., 2007;van de Ville et al., 2010;Freyer et al., 2012).', 'For _� ___ 1, the correlation time __ C and the corresponding correlation length __ diverge.', 'Note that correlation time __ C and characteristic time __ m , which coincide for exponential functional forms of the autocorrelation function, do not coincide for power-law ones.', 'The CLT is violated and scale separation is lost, so that microscopic stochasticity becomes detectable at macroscopic scales (Grigolini et al., 1999).', 'Activity undergoes anomalous diffusion with the MSD travelled by the particle no longer a linear function of time:']",0,"['In general, the Markovian approximation does not hold when long time scales of brain activity are considered.', 'Mittag-Leffler (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007a) scaling, with stretched exponential relaxation ___ exp __�(t/__) _� at microscopic scales (t < __), and asymptotical convergence to an inverse power law Novikov et al., 1997;Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2001;Gong et al., 2002;Freeman et al., 2003;Stam and de Bruin, 2004;Buiatti et al., 2007;van de Ville et al., 2010;Freyer et al., 2012).']"

This is usually achieved using model-based approaches. Here, we propose an alternative exploratory analysis. The originality of this contribution is twofold. First, we propose a synthetic, consistent, and comparative overview of the various stochastic processes and estimation procedures used to model and analyze scale invariance. Notably, it is explained how multifractal models are more versatile to adjust the scaling properties of fMRI data but require more elaborated analysis procedures. Second, we bring evidence of the existence of actual scaling in fMRI time series that are clearly disentangled from putative superimposed nonstationarities. By nature, scaling analysis requires the use of long enough signals with high frequency sampling rate. To this end, we make use of a localized 3-D echo volume imaging (EVI) technique, which has recently emerged in fMRI because it allows very fast acquisitions of successive brain volumes. High temporal resolution EVI fMRI data have been acquired both in resting state and during a slow event-related visual paradigm. A voxel-based systematic multifractal analysis has been performed over both kinds of data. Combining multifractal attribute estimates together with paired statistical tests, we observe significant scaling parameter changes between ongoing and evoked brain activity, which clearly validate an increase in long memory and suggest a global multifractality decrease effect under activation.","The break-down of scale invariance (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011(Ciuciu et al., , 2012Zilber et al., 2012) is tantamount to velocity changes.","['The size of a moment need not be stationary in time.', 'In fact, the breakdown of exact self-similarity for non-constant values of q in Equation 6implies that there no longer is a unique dilation factor, but a collection of factors with a given distribution.', 'Insofar as temporal scale invariance is a continuous symmetry linking a translation in time to a translation in space, brain activity can be seen as stemming from a system moving at constant velocity, given by the scaling exponent (Sornette, 2004).', 'The break-down of scale invariance (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011(Ciuciu et al., , 2012Zilber et al., 2012) is tantamount to velocity changes.']",0,"['The size of a moment need not be stationary in time.', 'The break-down of scale invariance (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011(Ciuciu et al., , 2012Zilber et al., 2012) is tantamount to velocity changes.']"

Roberts"", ""Petra Ritter"", ""Michael Breakspear""]","Multistability and scale-invariant fluctuations occur in a wide variety of biological organisms from bacteria to humans as well as financial, chemical and complex physical systems. Multistability refers to noise driven switches between multiple weakly stable states. Scale-invariant fluctuations arise when there is an approximately constant ratio between the mean and standard deviation of a system's fluctuations. Both are an important property of human perception, movement, decision making and computation and they occur together in the human alpha rhythm, imparting it with complex dynamical behavior. Here, we elucidate their fundamental dynamical mechanisms in a canonical model of nonlinear bifurcations under stochastic fluctuations. We find that the co-occurrence of multistability and scale-invariant fluctuations mandates two important dynamical properties: Multistability arises in the presence of a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, which generates co-existing attractors, whilst the introduction of multiplicative (state-dependent) noise ensures that as the system jumps between these attractors, fluctuations remain in constant proportion to their mean and their temporal statistics become long-tailed. The simple algebraic construction of this model affords a systematic analysis of the contribution of stochastic and nonlinear processes to cortical rhythms, complementing a recently proposed biophysical model. Similar dynamics also occur in a kinetic model of gene regulation, suggesting universality across a broad class of biological phenomena.","Mittag-Leffler (Bianco et al., 2007a) scaling, with stretched exponential relaxation ___ exp __�(t/__) _� at microscopic scales (t < __), and asymptotical convergence to an inverse power law Novikov et al., 1997;Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2001;Gong et al., 2002;Freeman et al., 2003;Stam and de Bruin, 2004;Buiatti et al., 2007;van de Ville et al., 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012).","['In general, the Markovian approximation does not hold when long time scales of brain activity are considered.', 'The friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent, and the statistics of the driving noise is neither Gaussian (Freyer et al., 2009) nor __-correlated.', 'The dynamics incorporates extended memory and temporal non-locality.', 'Ordinary exponential relaxation is replaced by complex, viz.', 'Mittag-Leffler (Bianco et al., 2007a) scaling, with stretched exponential relaxation ___ exp __�(t/__) _� at microscopic scales (t < __), and asymptotical convergence to an inverse power law Novikov et al., 1997;Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2001;Gong et al., 2002;Freeman et al., 2003;Stam and de Bruin, 2004;Buiatti et al., 2007;van de Ville et al., 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012).', 'For _� ___ 1, the correlation time __ C and the corresponding correlation length __ diverge.', 'Note that correlation time __ C and characteristic time __ m , which coincide for exponential functional forms of the autocorrelation function, do not coincide for power-law ones.', 'The CLT is violated and scale separation is lost, so that microscopic stochasticity becomes detectable at macroscopic scales (Grigolini et al., 1999).', 'Activity undergoes anomalous diffusion with the MSD travelled by the particle no longer a linear function of time:']",0,"['Mittag-Leffler (Bianco et al., 2007a) scaling, with stretched exponential relaxation ___ exp __�(t/__) _� at microscopic scales (t < __), and asymptotical convergence to an inverse power law Novikov et al., 1997;Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2001;Gong et al., 2002;Freeman et al., 2003;Stam and de Bruin, 2004;Buiatti et al., 2007;van de Ville et al., 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012).']"

Section 5 concludes by assessing the extent to which their analyses lead support to a conception of empathy as an intuitive experience of other minds",Theoretical inspiration for the intervention was also drawn from Antonovsky's [23] theory on health as a dynamic continuum and Merleau-Ponty's #AUTHOR_TAG phenomenological theory of the body as a foundation for knowledge and existence.,"['The intervention was based on Bodyknowledging theory [20] [21].', ""The theory asserts that individuals with chronic illness have bodily knowledge that constitutes an important resource for coping and health, and that patient's bodily knowledge is developed through a dynamic, nonlinear process of learning and health-related change in interaction with the environment [22]."", ""Theoretical inspiration for the intervention was also drawn from Antonovsky's [23] theory on health as a dynamic continuum and Merleau-Ponty's #AUTHOR_TAG phenomenological theory of the body as a foundation for knowledge and existence.""]",5,"[""Theoretical inspiration for the intervention was also drawn from Antonovsky's [23] theory on health as a dynamic continuum and Merleau-Ponty's #AUTHOR_TAG phenomenological theory of the body as a foundation for knowledge and existence.""]"

Now in this new book, Antonovsky builds on the ideas outlined in ""Health, Stress, and Coping,"" explaining in greater detail how the sense of coherence affects health. He brings together recent studies on health and illness and shows their relationships to the sense of coherence concept. He presents a complete questionnaire that professionals can use to measure the sense of coherence and discusses the evidence for its validity.

The purpose of the report is to review the impact of chronic disease on the population of pre- (50+) and post-retirement age in the European Union (EU). This report addresses the following topics: The burden of chronic disease in the older population pre- and post-retirement (chapter 3); The impact of chronic disease on the exit from the labour market (including unemployment, disability and early retirement) (chapter 4); The impact of leaving the labour market on the burden of chronic disease (chapter 4); Interventions to increase the social participation (including work participation) of people with a chronic disease (chapter 5). Chapter 6 provides a list of policy recommendations that follow from our analysis, including an overview of gaps and needs for further action at EU, and Member State level. The primary focus of this report is on the population of pre- (50+) and post-retirement age and the following groups of chronic diseases: cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, chronic lung diseases and depression. Our overview of the chronic disease burden will also pay attention, although in a limited way, to some neurodegenerative diseases (such as dementia) because of their importance among older age groups. We recognise, however, that in this way we only address a narrow selection of chronic diseases and that many other chronic diseases, such as musculoskeletal problems, the bulk of mental health problems and diseases of the sense organs, would also deserve proper attention. Although these chronic diseases are not part of the original scope of this report, many of the described issues and possibilities for tackling chronic diseases are also quite relevant to these conditions. The report focuses on EU Member States. Relevant information from EFTA (European Free Trade Association) Countries and Accession/Candidate Countries is included when possible.","With the prevalence of chronic illness rising worldwide, there is a need to engage patients in health promotion work in order to prevent further deterioration, to strengthen their health and their capacity to participate in society #AUTHOR_TAG [2].","['With the prevalence of chronic illness rising worldwide, there is a need to engage patients in health promotion work in order to prevent further deterioration, to strengthen their health and their capacity to participate in society #AUTHOR_TAG [2].', 'Interventions based on such work will reflect the philosophical perspective of ""health within illness"", which holds that individuals living with long-term health problems are capable of experiencing health and wellbeing despite their conditions [3] [4].', 'Summaries of research concerning people with various long-term conditions show that they have much in common as they face the challenges of trying to live as well as possible within the context of physical, mental, or social discomfort and limitation [5]- [7].', 'However, patient education and wellness-interventions in the context of chronic illness are often specific to particular diagnostic groups and not designed to be applied across diagnostic categories [8] [9].', 'Two of the few examples of interventions that are practiced more broadly are the Chronic Disease Self-Management Education (CDSME) developed by Lorig and colleagues in the USA [10] and the Vitality Training Program (VTP) developed by Steen and Haugli [11] in Norway.', 'Research findings showed that the lay-led CDSME program resulted in improved health status and reduced health care costs among patients suffering from arthritis [12] [13].', 'Improved health behavior and health status were also reported in a group of patients with serious mental illness [14].', 'However, a longitudinal randomized trial of stroke survivors who accomplished CDSME, showed that the intervention did not appear to impact self-efficacy and failed to influence outcomes such as mood or social outcomes [15].', 'This was also confirmed in a Cochrane review that focused on the outcomes of CDSME [16].']",0,"['With the prevalence of chronic illness rising worldwide, there is a need to engage patients in health promotion work in order to prevent further deterioration, to strengthen their health and their capacity to participate in society #AUTHOR_TAG [2].', 'Interventions based on such work will reflect the philosophical perspective of ""health within illness"", which holds that individuals living with long-term health problems are capable of experiencing health and wellbeing despite their conditions [3] [4].', 'Summaries of research concerning people with various long-term conditions show that they have much in common as they face the challenges of trying to live as well as possible within the context of physical, mental, or social discomfort and limitation [5]- [7].']"

Although this situation is costly, little evidence exists in relation to how psychological and social outcomes can be facilitated or how psychosocial decline can be prevented. In the area of adjustment following traumatic injury, there has been some suggestion that rehabilitation should focus on the expansion of resources, skills and self-efficacy as this will enable individuals to cope more effectively with their medical condition and circumstances. The current study was a longitudinal randomised controlled trial involving 100 people with stroke, 58 of whom were randomly allocated to an intervention based on the notion of psychosocial skill expansion. All were patients of a major hospital in Queensland, Australia. An existing self-management intervention (The Chronic Disease Self-Management Course, Lorig et al., 2001) was used to operationalise the concept of psychosocial skill expansion. The control group reported declines in functioning during the first year following stroke in the areas of family roles, activities of daily living, self-care and work productivity, that were not reported by the intervention group. Although the groups had reached similar levels by one year post-stroke, this intervention may have a protective function, presumably by improving capacity to manage the functional requirements of daily life. However, the intervention did not appear to have its impact through self-efficacy, as was expected, and failed to influence outcomes such as mood or social participation. Nevertheless, the intervention warrants further investigation, given that it appears to improve rehabilitation outcomes, at least in the short-term.","However, a longitudinal randomized trial of stroke survivors who accomplished CDSME, showed that the intervention did not appear to impact self-efficacy and failed to influence outcomes such as mood or social outcomes #AUTHOR_TAG.","['With the prevalence of chronic illness rising worldwide, there is a need to engage patients in health promotion work in order to prevent further deterioration, to strengthen their health and their capacity to participate in society [1] [2].', 'Interventions based on such work will reflect the philosophical perspective of ""health within illness"", which holds that individuals living with long-term health problems are capable of experiencing health and wellbeing despite their conditions [3] [4].', 'Summaries of research concerning people with various long-term conditions show that they have much in common as they face the challenges of trying to live as well as possible within the context of physical, mental, or social discomfort and limitation [5]- [7].', 'However, patient education and wellness-interventions in the context of chronic illness are often specific to particular diagnostic groups and not designed to be applied across diagnostic categories [8] [9].', 'Two of the few examples of interventions that are practiced more broadly are the Chronic Disease Self-Management Education (CDSME) developed by Lorig and colleagues in the USA [10] and the Vitality Training Program (VTP) developed by Steen and Haugli [11] in Norway.', 'Research findings showed that the lay-led CDSME program resulted in improved health status and reduced health care costs among patients suffering from arthritis [12] [13].', 'Improved health behavior and health status were also reported in a group of patients with serious mental illness [14].', 'However, a longitudinal randomized trial of stroke survivors who accomplished CDSME, showed that the intervention did not appear to impact self-efficacy and failed to influence outcomes such as mood or social outcomes #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'This was also confirmed in a Cochrane review that focused on the outcomes of CDSME [16].']",1,"['However, a longitudinal randomized trial of stroke survivors who accomplished CDSME, showed that the intervention did not appear to impact self-efficacy and failed to influence outcomes such as mood or social outcomes #AUTHOR_TAG.']"

It also explored the differential effectiveness of the intervention for subjects with specific diseases and comorbidities. Methods: The study was a six-month randomized, controlled trial at community-based sites comparing treatment subjects with wait-list control subjects. Participants were 952 patients 40 years of age or older with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of heart disease, lung disease, stroke, or arthritis. Health behaviors, health status, and health service utilization, as determined by mailed, self-administered questionnaires, were measured. Results: Treatment subjects, when compared with control subjects, demonstrated improvements at 6 months in weekly minutes of exercise, frequency of cognitive symptom management, communication with physicians, self-reported health, health distress, fatigue, disability, and social/role activities limitations.

Paterson""]","Purpose: To present the Shifting Perspectives Model of Chronic Illness, which was derived from a metasynthesis of 292 qualitative research studies. Design: The model was derived from a metasynthesis of qualitative research about the reported experiences of adults with a chronic illness. The 292 primary research studies included a variety of interpretive research methods and were conducted by researchers from numerous countries and disciplines. Methods: Metastudy, a metasynthesis method developed by the author in collaboration with six other researchers consisted of three analytic components (meta-data-analysis, metamethod, and metatheory), followed by a synthesis component in which new knowledge about the phenomenon was generated from the findings. Findings: Many of the assumptions that underlie previous models, such as a single, linear trajectory of living with a chronic disease, were challenged. The Shifting Perspectives Model indicated that living with chronic illness was an ongoing and continually shifting process in which an illness-in-the-foreground or wellness-in-the-foreground perspective has specific functions in the person's world. Conclusions: The Shifting Perspectives Model helps users provide an explanation of chronically ill persons' variations in their attention to symptoms over time, sometimes in ways that seem ill-advised or even harmful to their health. The model also indicates direction to health professionals about supporting people with chronic illness.","Summaries of research concerning people with various long-term conditions show that they have much in common as they face the challenges of trying to live as well as possible within the context of physical, mental, or social discomfort and limitation [5]- #AUTHOR_TAG.","['With the prevalence of chronic illness rising worldwide, there is a need to engage patients in health promotion work in order to prevent further deterioration, to strengthen their health and their capacity to participate in society [1] [2].', 'Interventions based on such work will reflect the philosophical perspective of ""health within illness"", which holds that individuals living with long-term health problems are capable of experiencing health and wellbeing despite their conditions [3] [4].', 'Summaries of research concerning people with various long-term conditions show that they have much in common as they face the challenges of trying to live as well as possible within the context of physical, mental, or social discomfort and limitation [5]- #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'However, patient education and wellness-interventions in the context of chronic illness are often specific to particular diagnostic groups and not designed to be applied across diagnostic categories [8] [9].', 'Two of the few examples of interventions that are practiced more broadly are the Chronic Disease Self-Management Education (CDSME) developed by Lorig and colleagues in the USA [10] and the Vitality Training Program (VTP) developed by Steen and Haugli [11] in Norway.', 'Research findings showed that the lay-led CDSME program resulted in improved health status and reduced health care costs among patients suffering from arthritis [12] [13].', 'Improved health behavior and health status were also reported in a group of patients with serious mental illness [14].', 'However, a longitudinal randomized trial of stroke survivors who accomplished CDSME, showed that the intervention did not appear to impact self-efficacy and failed to influence outcomes such as mood or social outcomes [15].', 'This was also confirmed in a Cochrane review that focused on the outcomes of CDSME [16].']",0,"['With the prevalence of chronic illness rising worldwide, there is a need to engage patients in health promotion work in order to prevent further deterioration, to strengthen their health and their capacity to participate in society [1] [2].', 'Interventions based on such work will reflect the philosophical perspective of ""health within illness"", which holds that individuals living with long-term health problems are capable of experiencing health and wellbeing despite their conditions [3] [4].', 'Summaries of research concerning people with various long-term conditions show that they have much in common as they face the challenges of trying to live as well as possible within the context of physical, mental, or social discomfort and limitation [5]- #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'However, patient education and wellness-interventions in the context of chronic illness are often specific to particular diagnostic groups and not designed to be applied across diagnostic categories [8] [9].', 'Two of the few examples of interventions that are practiced more broadly are the Chronic Disease Self-Management Education (CDSME) developed by Lorig and colleagues in the USA [10] and the Vitality Training Program (VTP) developed by Steen and Haugli [11] in Norway.']"

Systematic review articles were reviewed and searched using key terms conducted on Google Scholar and PubMed. Results show that methods used by NTD programmes rely heavily on focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, often with time-consuming analysis and limited information on how results are applied. Results from other fields offered insight into a wider range of methods, including participatory approaches, and on how to increase programmatic uptake of findings.

Stuifbergen"", ""Marian Morris"", ""Jae Hak Jung"", ""Diana Pierini"", ""Stephanie Morgan""]","BACKGROUND Persons living with the effects of chronic and disabling conditions are often at increased risk for the development of secondary conditions and disabilities that can lead to further decline in health status, independence, functional status, life satisfaction, and overall quality of life.   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to review the evidence for the benefits of wellness/health promotion interventions for persons with chronic and disabling conditions.   METHODS The authors conducted a Medline search (1990-2007) using terms related to wellness and health promotion cross-referenced with general terms for chronic and disabling conditions, as well as 15 specific chronic and/or disabling conditions (e.g., multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury). Selection of studies was limited to those published in English that reported randomized controlled trails or prospective studies that involved adult human subjects with a chronic and/or disabling condition. All selected studies focused on some aspect of a wellness or health promotion intervention and involved a comparison or control group. Of the 5,847 studies initially identified in the search using medical subject heading terms, 190 met the criteria for full review. Data were extracted from these publications and summarized using descriptive statistics.   RESULTS Almost all studies (95%) explored the effects of wellness intervention in a sample diagnosed with a single condition (e.g., cancer, stroke, arthritis). Although the mean sample size was 100, the range in sample size varied widely (6-688); 25% of the studies had sample of 30 or fewer. Almost all studies (89.5%) reported positive effects of the wellness intervention, although the delivery and content of interventions as well as the measurement of outcomes, varied greatly.   CONCLUSIONS Our findings support an immediate post-intervention positive impact of wellness interventions across persons with a wide variety of chronic and disabling conditions. Future research that clearly specifies primary study outcomes and follows the CONSORT guidelines will strengthen future reviews of the evidence and facilitate application of the evidence of practice.","However, patient education and wellness-interventions in the context of chronic illness are often specific to particular diagnostic groups and not designed to be applied across diagnostic categories [8] #AUTHOR_TAG.","['With the prevalence of chronic illness rising worldwide, there is a need to engage patients in health promotion work in order to prevent further deterioration, to strengthen their health and their capacity to participate in society [1] [2].', 'Interventions based on such work will reflect the philosophical perspective of ""health within illness"", which holds that individuals living with long-term health problems are capable of experiencing health and wellbeing despite their conditions [3] [4].', 'Summaries of research concerning people with various long-term conditions show that they have much in common as they face the challenges of trying to live as well as possible within the context of physical, mental, or social discomfort and limitation [5]- [7].', 'However, patient education and wellness-interventions in the context of chronic illness are often specific to particular diagnostic groups and not designed to be applied across diagnostic categories [8] #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Two of the few examples of interventions that are practiced more broadly are the Chronic Disease Self-Management Education (CDSME) developed by Lorig and colleagues in the USA [10] and the Vitality Training Program (VTP) developed by Steen and Haugli [11] in Norway.', 'Research findings showed that the lay-led CDSME program resulted in improved health status and reduced health care costs among patients suffering from arthritis [12] [13].', 'Improved health behavior and health status were also reported in a group of patients with serious mental illness [14].', 'However, a longitudinal randomized trial of stroke survivors who accomplished CDSME, showed that the intervention did not appear to impact self-efficacy and failed to influence outcomes such as mood or social outcomes [15].', 'This was also confirmed in a Cochrane review that focused on the outcomes of CDSME [16].']",0,"['However, patient education and wellness-interventions in the context of chronic illness are often specific to particular diagnostic groups and not designed to be applied across diagnostic categories [8] #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Two of the few examples of interventions that are practiced more broadly are the Chronic Disease Self-Management Education (CDSME) developed by Lorig and colleagues in the USA [10] and the Vitality Training Program (VTP) developed by Steen and Haugli [11] in Norway.']"

The contrasting environments permitted assessment of the influences of physical and biological factors on temporal variability in DVM patterns and a test of the hypothesis that a reduction in summer sea ice extent and thickness following climatic warming will lead to changes in DVM via the loss of a shading effect on the pelagic marine environment. Acoustic backscatter and vertical velocity data from moored 300-kHz acoustic Doppler current profilers were used to derive DVM patterns, while measurements of sea ice and snow thickness enabled assessment of the underwater light environment and consideration of its potential to influence DVM. Pronounced differences in DVM between the sites emerged during summertime when intermittent synchronized DVM was observed at the ice-free site, whereas the ice-covered site was characterized by asynchronous behavior, thereby highlighting the influence of sea ice. Notably, the 0.8-m-thick sea ice cover was deemed important for its influence on water column properties such as food, turbidity, and zooplankton species composition, as indicated by biological samples from moored sediment traps, rather than a simple shading of the ocean and direct modification of zooplankton DVM. Loss of Arctic sea ice is likely to have an indirect but substantial effect on zooplankton DVM via modification of hydrography and composition of the pelagic community.","Oceanographic data (Figure 2) were gathered from two moorings deployed in Kongsfjorden and Rijpfjorden, respectively (see #AUTHOR_TAG for details).","['Oceanographic data (Figure 2) were gathered from two moorings deployed in Kongsfjorden and Rijpfjorden, respectively (see #AUTHOR_TAG for details).', 'The moorings were located in the immediate vicinity (1 km apart) to the trawling grounds in both fjords, and have been in operation since 2002 as part of a long term monitoring program.']",5,"['Oceanographic data (Figure 2) were gathered from two moorings deployed in Kongsfjorden and Rijpfjorden, respectively (see #AUTHOR_TAG for details).']"

To determine the potential impact of new ecological interactions, we studied the diet of co-occurring juvenile gadoids in fjords, open water, and sea ice around Svalbard. We also reviewed the available literature on polar cod feeding in different habitats across the Arctic to determine whether region, habitat, or fish size may influence diet. Feeding by polar cod in the pelagic zone was size dependent, with small fish primarily consuming Calanus spp. and smaller copepods, with an increasing ration of Themisto spp. at larger sizes. In benthic habitats, diets were more varied and included considerably more unidentified material and sediment. Less than 40% dietary overlap was detected among the three species when they were found together. Stable isotope analyses indicated these patterns were representative of longer-term assimilation. The low interspecific dietary overlap suggests little direct competition. Future increases in abundance and the high predation potential of the boreal taxa, however, may impact the persistence of polar cod on some Arctic shelves.","Altered marine community structures [7][8][9] and a northward expansion of boreal species [10,#AUTHOR_TAG] are common expectations, to some extent also supported by observations [12].","['Climate variability and global warming have changed the Arctic, most notably seen in the abrupt decline in Arctic sea ice extent and thickness [1].', 'As the temperature is predicted to rise disproportionally more in the Arctic compared to global trends [2], these current and future perspectives are likely to pose a significant challenge for both the marine [3][4][5] as well as the terrestrial [6] Arctic ecosystems.', 'Altered marine community structures [7][8][9] and a northward expansion of boreal species [10,#AUTHOR_TAG] are common expectations, to some extent also supported by observations [12].', 'When species expand their distribution ranges northwards, it may lead to either co-existence with, or replacement of their native Arctic counterparts [13].', 'Mechanisms involved in such range expansions are often directly associated with changes in water masses [14,15], but may also be more indirect through biological interactions [3,8].', 'Commonly predicted replacements include the high Arctic calanoid Calanus glacialis being replaced by its more boreal sister taxa, Calanus finmarchicus [16,17], as well as the replacement of the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) by killer whale (Orcinus orca) as a likely effect of increased temperatures and loss of sea ice in the Arctic [18].']",5,"['Altered marine community structures [7][8][9] and a northward expansion of boreal species [10,#AUTHOR_TAG] are common expectations, to some extent also supported by observations [12].']"

Together, these traits define a life-history of reduced reproductive effort. Understanding the optimal allocation of reproductive effort, and specifically reduced reproductive effort, has been one of the key problems motivating the development of life-history theory. Because of their unusual constellation of life-history traits, primates play an important role in the continued development of life-history theory. In this review, I present the evidence for the reduced reproductive effort life histories of primates and discuss the ways that such life-history tactics are understood in contemporary theory. Such tactics are particularly consistent with the predictions of stochastic demographic models, suggesting a key role for environmental variability in the evolution of primate life histories. The tendency for primates to specialize in high-quality, high-variability food items may make them particularly susceptible to environmental variability and explains their low reproductive-effort tactics.

This hypothesis is based on predictions from a life history simulation model of Barents Sea capelin that shows that iteroparity is more profitable than semelparity for females, but for males, semelparity with several matings with females may be as profitable as iteroparity. These predictions are supported by (i) reports of males mating with several females during a spawning season, (ii) males having a lower gonadosomatic index than females and instead spending their energy on mating and somatic growth, and (iii) an observed higher mortality for males after spawning. The Darwinian fitness of female capelin is limited by the amount of eggs they can carry, and offspring production may only be increased by undertaking several spawning seasons with yearly intervals.

Their distributions are dependent on water masses, with polar cod being associated with cold, sub-zero Arctic water, whereas capelin is distributed further south into Atlantic water masses. The distribution of polar cod is more static than that of capelin, whose distribution extends further north in warm years and fluctuates greatly based on predator-prey relationships. The species occur sympatrically in the Barents Sea, with large standing biomasses (0.5-1.5x106 t polar cod versus 3-4x106 t capelin). They overlap in distribution in the southern and eastern Barents Sea, whereas polar cod are most abundant in the icy waters of the Arctic. Both species aggregate in large schools and utilize zooplankton food sources, such as calanoid copepods. Polar cod also feed to a larger extent on amphipods, whereas capelin feed predominately on krill. Both species represent high-energy prey (lipids) for upper trophic levels. Global warming, with reduction in sea ice and increase in temperature, is expected to affect these two species differently. Polar cod will likely lose the sympagic (ice-associated) part of its life cycle and become more restricted in pelagic distribution during summer, whereas the capelin stock may expand to the north and east, although with considerable interannual fluctuations.","In high Arctic marine ecosystems, the polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is regarded as a key link in the food web between lower and higher trophic levels [19,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['In high Arctic marine ecosystems, the polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is regarded as a key link in the food web between lower and higher trophic levels [19,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'Polar cod has been a focal point for studies of climate [11,[21][22][23] and pollution impacts [24,25].', 'Yet, current knowledge regarding this important Arctic species is surprisingly scattered and inconclusive, preventing a holistic understanding of its life history and ecology.', ""Understanding life history strategies, the schedules of growth, fecundity and mortality [26], is imperative for our ability to predict species' responses to environmental change."", 'Importantly, there are tight couplings among altered energy acquisition, survival, and consequently responses in energy allocation [27].', 'We need to cover these dimensions to understand how polar cod will respond to environmental changes.']",0,"['In high Arctic marine ecosystems, the polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is regarded as a key link in the food web between lower and higher trophic levels [19,#AUTHOR_TAG].']"

A. glacialis fed mainly on the mysid Mysis oculata and other benthic-associated prey, whereas B. saida ate the copepod Metridia longa and other pelagic prey. Both diet and stable isotopes strongly suggest a spatial segregation in feeding habitat, with A. glacialis being associated with the benthic food web (mean d13C = -20.81%0, d15N = 14.92%0) and B. saida with the pelagic food web (mean d13C = -21.25%0, d15N = 13.64%0). The dietary differences and isotopic signals were highly significant in the secluded TF and less clear in the open DB, where prey and predators may be readily advected from adjacent areas with other trophic conditions. This is the first study on the trophic position of A.glacialis inferred from analyses of stable isotopes. The subtle interaction between the Arctic gadoids should be carefully monitored in the light of ocean warming and on-going invasions of boreal fishes into the Arctic seas.","In high Arctic marine ecosystems, the polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is regarded as a key link in the food web between lower and higher trophic levels [#AUTHOR_TAG,20].","['In high Arctic marine ecosystems, the polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is regarded as a key link in the food web between lower and higher trophic levels [#AUTHOR_TAG,20].', 'Polar cod has been a focal point for studies of climate [11,[21][22][23] and pollution impacts [24,25].', 'Yet, current knowledge regarding this important Arctic species is surprisingly scattered and inconclusive, preventing a holistic understanding of its life history and ecology.', ""Understanding life history strategies, the schedules of growth, fecundity and mortality [26], is imperative for our ability to predict species' responses to environmental change."", 'Importantly, there are tight couplings among altered energy acquisition, survival, and consequently responses in energy allocation [27].', 'We need to cover these dimensions to understand how polar cod will respond to environmental changes.']",0,"['In high Arctic marine ecosystems, the polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is regarded as a key link in the food web between lower and higher trophic levels [#AUTHOR_TAG,20].']"

Regional seasonality and the cross-shelf exchange processes have been investigated using conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) observations from 2000-2003 and a 5-month mooring deployment through the spring and summer of 2002. Modeling of shelf-fjord dynamics was performed with the Bergen Ocean Model. Observations show a rapid and overwhelming intrusion of Atlantic Water across the shelf and into the fjord during midsummer giving rise to intense seasonality. Pockets of Atlantic Water, from the West Spitsbergen Current, form through barotropic instabilities at the shelf front. These leak onto the shelf and propagate as topographically steered features toward the fjord. Model results indicate that such cross-front exchange is enhanced by north winds. Normally, Atlantic Water penetration into the fjord is inhibited by a density front at the fjord mouth. This geostrophic control mechanism is found to be more important than the hydraulic control common to many fjords. Slow modification of the fjord water during spring reduces the effectiveness of geostrophic control, and by midsummer, Atlantic Water intrudes into the fjord, switching from being Arctic dominant to Atlantic dominant. Atlantic Water continues to intrude throughout the summer and by September reaches some quasi steady state condition. The fjord adopts a ''cold'' or ''warm'' mode according to the degree of Atlantic Water occupation. Horizontal exchange across the shelf may be an important process causing seasonal variability in the northward heat transport to the Arctic.",The high Arctic archipelago of Svalbard is characterized by water masses of both Atlantic and Arctic origin (Figure 2) #AUTHOR_TAG.,"['The two climatic domains of the present study were defined based on oceanographical characteristics as well as the diversity of potential prey and predators.', 'The high Arctic archipelago of Svalbard is characterized by water masses of both Atlantic and Arctic origin (Figure 2) #AUTHOR_TAG.', ""Rijpfjorden as well as Billefjorden [31] and the southern part of Hinlopen are predominantly influenced by Arctic water masses due to their location (Figure 2), and are therefore referred to as ''Arctic-type'' fjords [30]."", ""In contrast, the fjords on the west coast of Svalbard (Bellsund, Isfjorden, Adventfjorden, Kongsfjorden and Krossfjorden) are largely dominated by warm water masses without formation of seasonal sea ice (referred to as 'Atlantic type' fjord [28,32], Figure 2)."", 'It is important to note that in our approach, we do not consider if temperature is directly influencing the populations of polar cod (see also below).', 'Rather, temperature is used as an indicator of differences in both the physical and biological habitat of the two domains.']",0,['The high Arctic archipelago of Svalbard is characterized by water masses of both Atlantic and Arctic origin (Figure 2) #AUTHOR_TAG.']

Bradstreet""]","In 1979, 17 species of birds were seen during studies near the Pond Inlet ice edge. Northern fulmars ( Fulmarus glacialis ) black-legged kittiwakes ( Rissa tridactyla ) thick billed murres ( Uria lomvia ) and black guillemots ( Cepphus grylle ) all avoided the ice edge when bordered with heavy pack ice and all but kittiwakes used the ice edge primarily for feeding. Guillemots and fulmars occurred in highest numbers in water along rough and moderately rough landfast ice: murres and kittiwakes showed no preference for such areas or for the other habitat surveyed (smooth landfast ice). Narwhals ( Monodon monoceros ) white whales ( Delphinapterus leucas ) and ringed seals ( Phoca hispida ) were the only marine mammals common at the ice edge. Whales repeatedly dived under the edge - probably feeding, searching for open water west of the ice edge, or both. Densities of seals near the ice edge were higher than elsewhere on landfast ice. Divers observed arctic cod ( Boreogadus saida ) close to the undersurface of landfast ice. Fish offshore were generally smaller, younger, and smaller-at-age than those inshore. Offshore, arctic cod were more numerous in areas with a rough under-ice surface than under smooth ice. Cod concentrated in crevices within rough under-ice surfaces. Inshore, cod were captured from ice cracks over shallow water. I conclude that vertebrates occur at ice edges for one or more of several reasons. Ringed seals and arctic cod live in close association with landfast ice: they probably occur near ice edges simply because landfast ice is present there. Ice edges seem to be primarily barriers against the further movements of whales toward summering locations. Finally, for murres and some other birds, ice edges seem to be favored feeding locations (relative to open sea conditions) due to greater access to preferred foods.

Among the traits that could evolve in response to fishing, growth has lately received attention. However, critical reading of the literature on growth evolution in fish reveals conceptual confusion about the nature of 'growth' itself as an evolving trait, and about the different ways fishing can affect growth and size-at-age of fish, both on ecological and on evolutionary time-scales. It is important to separate the advantages of being big and the costs of growing to a large size, particularly when studying life-history evolution. In this review, we explore the selection pressures on growth and the resultant evolution of growth from a mechanistic viewpoint. We define important concepts and outline the processes that must be accounted for before observed phenotypic changes can be ascribed to growth evolution. When listing traits that could be traded-off with growth rate, we group the mechanisms into those affecting resource acquisition and those governing resource allocation. We summarize potential effects of fishing on traits related to growth and discuss methods for detecting evolution of growth. We also challenge the prevailing expectation that fishing-induced evolution should always lead to slower growth.","Importantly, there are tight couplings among altered energy acquisition, survival, and consequently responses in energy allocation #AUTHOR_TAG.","['In high Arctic marine ecosystems, the polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is regarded as a key link in the food web between lower and higher trophic levels [19,20].', 'Polar cod has been a focal point for studies of climate [11,[21][22][23] and pollution impacts [24,25].', 'Yet, current knowledge regarding this important Arctic species is surprisingly scattered and inconclusive, preventing a holistic understanding of its life history and ecology.', ""Understanding life history strategies, the schedules of growth, fecundity and mortality [26], is imperative for our ability to predict species' responses to environmental change."", 'Importantly, there are tight couplings among altered energy acquisition, survival, and consequently responses in energy allocation #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'We need to cover these dimensions to understand how polar cod will respond to environmental changes.']",4,"['In high Arctic marine ecosystems, the polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is regarded as a key link in the food web between lower and higher trophic levels [19,20].', 'Polar cod has been a focal point for studies of climate [11,[21][22][23] and pollution impacts [24,25].', 'Importantly, there are tight couplings among altered energy acquisition, survival, and consequently responses in energy allocation #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'We need to cover these dimensions to understand how polar cod will respond to environmental changes.']"

N. Reznick"", ""B. Braun""]","We argue, based on reviewed literature covering reptiles, amphibians, birds, and fish, that fat storage may represent a life history adaptation because it enables an organism to shift in time when resources are allocated to reproduction. We applied these arguments to fat and population cycles in three populations of the mosquito fish, Gambusia affinis. For males, there appeared to be a constant size at maturation during the reproductive season. Mature males became scarce late in the summer. At the same time, immature males delayed maturity and attained much larger sizes; they matured in large numbers in the fall. The amount of stored fat tended to be equal for immature and mature males at all times except in the late summer. In the August samples, when mature males were relatively rare, they also had the lowest level of fat reserves. It appears that the older generation of mature males did not store fat and did not overwinter. At the same time, immature males registered a two to three fold increase in fat reserves. These differences in fat content between mature and immature males disappeared by September, probably because of the recruitment of a new generation of mature males. The reserves were gradually utilized during the winter. Females reproduced from the late spring through mid- to late-summer. They stopped reproducing in the late summer, when there was ample time to produce an additional litter of young. There was an inverse relationship between resources devoted to reproduction and fat reserves. As reproductive allotment decreased in the late summer, fat reserves increased. The magnitude of the change in fat reserves was similar to that displayed by males. The reserves were depleted over the winter. Significant reserves remained at the beginning of the reproductive season the following spring. Reproducing females utilized the remaining reserves significantly more rapidly than non-reproducing females. An analysis of resource availability revealed an overall decrease in food availability in the late summer, coincident with the increase in fat reserves. These cycles are therefore not attributable to changes in resource availability. They instead indicate a change in how resources are allocated by the fish. The trends in the data indicate that fat reserves are used to shift investment in reproduction from the late summer to the following spring. In males, deferring maturity, rather than maturing in August, allows them to store the necessary reserves to survive the winter so that they can mate the following spring. In females, a subset of the fat reserves is intended for producing the first clutch of eggs the following spring. The female pattern corresponds to those reported for a diversity of organisms. The possible advantages of shifting reproductive effort from the fall to the following spring include higher fecundity and higher offspring fitness. The limitations of the methodology and potential directions for future research are discussed.","Gonadal maturation was only considered from January   samples, as males are known to increase gonad size several months before females #AUTHOR_TAG, making direct comparison of GSI between genders impossible except in the pre-spawning period in January.","['All presented data are based on total length measurements.', 'When only fork length (FL) was available, TL was determined with help of a linear regression FL = 0.9641 TL+0.0113 (R 2 = 0.996), based on 1463 TL and FL records (see Figure S2).', 'The GSI was calculated using the equation GSI = 1006 gonad weight/somatic weight.', 'Gonadal maturation was only considered from January   samples, as males are known to increase gonad size several months before females #AUTHOR_TAG, making direct comparison of GSI between genders impossible except in the pre-spawning period in January.', 'As a threshold level for maturity, mature polar cod were defined by GSI.10% (Table 2).', ""For the sex-ratio distributions (Figure 3), the category ''immature'' were specimens with unidentifiable gonads.""]",5,"['Gonadal maturation was only considered from January   samples, as males are known to increase gonad size several months before females #AUTHOR_TAG, making direct comparison of GSI between genders impossible except in the pre-spawning period in January.']"

In the past decade, geographic displacement of marine mammal population distributions has coincided with a reduction of benthic prey populations, an increase in pelagic fish, a reduction in sea ice, and an increase in air and ocean temperatures.

Objective To systematically review recent smoking cessation research in Australia, a nation advanced in tobacco control, to determine what is known about smokers who quit unassisted in order to (1) inform a research agenda to develop greater understanding of the many smokers who quit unassisted and (2) elucidate possible lessons for policy and mass communication about cessation.  Methods In January 2013, four e-databases and the grey literature were searched for articles published 2005-2012 on smoking cessation in Australia. Articles focusing solely on interventions designed to stimulate cessation were excluded, as were articles focusing solely on assisted cessation, leaving articles reporting on smokers who quit unassisted. Data from articles reporting on unassisted cessation were extracted and grouped into related categories.   Results 248 articles reported on smoking cessation, of which 63 focused solely on interventions designed to stimulate cessation, leaving 185 reporting on the method of cessation ('how' a smoker quits). Of these, 166 focused solely on assisted cessation, leaving 19 reporting, either directly or indirectly, on smokers who quit unassisted. Data from these studies indicated 54%-69% of ex-smokers quit unassisted, and 41%-58% of current smokers had attempted to quit unassisted.   Conclusions The majority of Australian smokers quit or attempt to quit unassisted, yet little research has been dedicated to understanding this process.

Ho""]","The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of Chinese adolescents toward smoking, giving up smoking, and smoking cessation programs presently available. The study was a qualitative study carried out in 2002 by focus groups of 32 male secondary school students in Hong Kong who were either current smokers or had recently given up smoking. Subjects were students (grades 8-10) attending two full-day secondary schools in Hong Kong. Participants did not feel the need to make any serious psychological preparation for quitting. They underestimated the addictive nature of cigarette smoking and felt that they could choose to quit smoking at any time with little difficulty. Several barriers to quitting were reported, including boredom, peer influence, the urge to smoke, school work pressure, the wish to do something with their hands, difficulty in concentrating, and the ready availability of free cigarettes from peers. Those who had attempted to quit smoking (26/32) reported that peer influence and boredom were the main reasons why they started smoking and insisted that willpower and determination could have helped them in their quitting attempt. Participants were unanimous that pressure or encouragement from teachers, parents, or girlfriends did not help them to stay off cigarettes. Most (24/32) of the current smokers knew that smoking cessation services were available in Hong Kong, only 50% (12/24) of those who knew had made use of such services. None of the participants were able to identify any effective way of quitting smoking, though some suggested that the best practical measure was to avoid friends who smoked. The study suggests that attempts to persuade young people to quit smoking might benefit if they were framed to address issues such as the strong influence of their peers, the ease with which tobacco products can be obtained, the casual attitudes of young people toward smoking cessation, the perceived pros and cons of quitting, and (given that underage smoking is frowned upon by many parents and teachers) the need to respect confidentiality when offering support.","[30] Subsequent to this, no qualitative studies were identified that focused on unassisted cessation per se: the six post-2000 studies (from Hong Kong, US, UK, Canada and Norway) had as their primary focus either cessation in general [#AUTHOR_TAG,34,[36][37][38] or health behaviour change.","['The earliest study identified was a 1977 US study investigating why smokers seeking treatment (psychotherapy) often fared no better than smokers who quit unassisted.', '[28] This was followed in the late 1980s and 1990s by three in-depth sociological studies (from the US and Sweden) investigating unassisted cessation as a phenomenon in its own right, [29,31,32] and one US sociological study in which unassisted cessation data were reported but this was not the primary focus of the study.', '[30] Subsequent to this, no qualitative studies were identified that focused on unassisted cessation per se: the six post-2000 studies (from Hong Kong, US, UK, Canada and Norway) had as their primary focus either cessation in general [#AUTHOR_TAG,34,[36][37][38] or health behaviour change.', '[35] Research question 2: What are the views and experiences of smokers who quit unassisted?']",4,"['[30] Subsequent to this, no qualitative studies were identified that focused on unassisted cessation per se: the six post-2000 studies (from Hong Kong, US, UK, Canada and Norway) had as their primary focus either cessation in general [#AUTHOR_TAG,34,[36][37][38] or health behaviour change.', '[35] Research question 2: What are the views and experiences of smokers who quit unassisted?']"

The smoking cessation process of 62 ex-smokers (m = 50, SD = 11) of both genders, with eight years of abstinence on average, was characterized. Most of them had already done at least three previous attempts to quit smoking, motivated by health issues, and said they no longer feel craving. Craving, stress, withdrawal symptoms and weight gain were related by them to relapse. Parties, alcohol and coffee use, loneliness and stress were considered triggers for craving. The use of cognitive and behavioral strategies for the maintenance of abstinence was highly reported by them. Identifying variables associated with prolonged nicotine abstinence may contribute to increase the effectiveness of aid to smoking, treatment adherence and remission rates of smoking.Keywords: nicotine addiction, relapse, cigarette consumption","[28] This was followed in the late 1980s and 1990s by three in-depth sociological studies (from the US and Sweden) investigating unassisted cessation as a phenomenon in its own right, [#AUTHOR_TAG,31,32] and one US sociological study in which unassisted cessation data were reported but this was not the primary focus of the study.","['The earliest study identified was a 1977 US study investigating why smokers seeking treatment (psychotherapy) often fared no better than smokers who quit unassisted.', '[28] This was followed in the late 1980s and 1990s by three in-depth sociological studies (from the US and Sweden) investigating unassisted cessation as a phenomenon in its own right, [#AUTHOR_TAG,31,32] and one US sociological study in which unassisted cessation data were reported but this was not the primary focus of the study.', '[30] Subsequent to this, no qualitative studies were identified that focused on unassisted cessation per se: the six post-2000 studies (from Hong Kong, US, UK, Canada and Norway) had as their primary focus either cessation in general [33,34,[36][37][38] or health behaviour change.', '[35] Research question 2: What are the views and experiences of smokers who quit unassisted?']",4,"['[28] This was followed in the late 1980s and 1990s by three in-depth sociological studies (from the US and Sweden) investigating unassisted cessation as a phenomenon in its own right, [#AUTHOR_TAG,31,32] and one US sociological study in which unassisted cessation data were reported but this was not the primary focus of the study.', '[30] Subsequent to this, no qualitative studies were identified that focused on unassisted cessation per se: the six post-2000 studies (from Hong Kong, US, UK, Canada and Norway) had as their primary focus either cessation in general [33,34,[36][37][38] or health behaviour change.', '[35] Research question 2: What are the views and experiences of smokers who quit unassisted?']"

Available in Munin at http://hdl.handle.net/10037/4537Every year, more than 650,000 Europeans die because they smoke. Smoking is considered to be the single most preventable factor influencing health. General practitioners (GP) are encouraged to advise on smoking cessation at all suitable consultations. Unsolicited advice from GPs results in one of 40-60 smokers stopping smoking. Smoking cessation advice has traditionally been given on an individual basis. Our aim was to gain  insights that may help general practitioners understand why people smoke, and why smokers stop and then remain quitting and, from this, to find fruitful approaches to the dialogue about stopping smoking.  Interviews with 18 elderly smokers and ex-smokers about their smoking and decisions to smoke or quit  were analysed with qualitative content analysis across narratives. A narrative perspective was applied.  Six stages in the smoking story emerged, from the start of smoking, where friends had a huge influence, until maintenance of the possible cessation. The informants were influenced by ""all the others"" at all stages. Spouses had vital influence in stopping, relapses and continued smoking. The majority of quitters had stopped by  themselves without medication, and had kept the tobacco handy for 3-6 months. Often smoking cessation seemed to happen unplanned, though sometimes it was planned. With an increasingly negative social attitude towards smoking, the informants became more aware of the risks of smoking.  ""All the others"" is a clue in the smoking story. For smoking cessation, it is essential to be aware of the influence of friends and family members, especially a spouse. People may stop smoking unplanned, even when motivation is not obvious. Information from the community and from doctors on the negative aspects of smoking should continue. Eliciting life-long smoking narratives may open up for a fruitful dialogue, as well as prompting reflection about smoking and adding to the motivation to stop","[30] Subsequent to this, no qualitative studies were identified that focused on unassisted cessation per se: the six post-2000 studies (from Hong Kong, US, UK, Canada and Norway) had as their primary focus either cessation in general [33,34,[36][37]#AUTHOR_TAG or health behaviour change.","['The earliest study identified was a 1977 US study investigating why smokers seeking treatment (psychotherapy) often fared no better than smokers who quit unassisted.', '[28] This was followed in the late 1980s and 1990s by three in-depth sociological studies (from the US and Sweden) investigating unassisted cessation as a phenomenon in its own right, [29,31,32] and one US sociological study in which unassisted cessation data were reported but this was not the primary focus of the study.', '[30] Subsequent to this, no qualitative studies were identified that focused on unassisted cessation per se: the six post-2000 studies (from Hong Kong, US, UK, Canada and Norway) had as their primary focus either cessation in general [33,34,[36][37]#AUTHOR_TAG or health behaviour change.', '[35] Research question 2: What are the views and experiences of smokers who quit unassisted?']",4,"['The earliest study identified was a 1977 US study investigating why smokers seeking treatment (psychotherapy) often fared no better than smokers who quit unassisted.', '[28] This was followed in the late 1980s and 1990s by three in-depth sociological studies (from the US and Sweden) investigating unassisted cessation as a phenomenon in its own right, [29,31,32] and one US sociological study in which unassisted cessation data were reported but this was not the primary focus of the study.', '[30] Subsequent to this, no qualitative studies were identified that focused on unassisted cessation per se: the six post-2000 studies (from Hong Kong, US, UK, Canada and Norway) had as their primary focus either cessation in general [33,34,[36][37]#AUTHOR_TAG or health behaviour change.', '[35] Research question 2: What are the views and experiences of smokers who quit unassisted?']"

The purpose of this study is to systematically review the literature to determine what proportion of adult smokers report attempting to quit unassisted in population-based studies.A four stage strategy was used to conduct a search of the literature including searching 9 electronic databases (PUBMED, MEDLINE (OVID) (1948-), EMBASE (1947-), CINAHL, ISI Web of Science with conference proceedings, PsycINFO (1806-), Scopus, Conference Papers Index, and Digital Dissertations), the gray literature, online forums and hand searches.A total of 26 population-based prevalence studies of unassisted quitting were identified, which presented data collected from 1986 through 2010, in 9 countries. Unassisted quit attempts ranged from a high of 95.3% in a study in Christchurch, New Zealand, between 1998 and 1999, to a low of 40.6% in a national Australian study conducted between 2008 and 2009. In 24 of the 26 studies reviewed, a majority of quit attempts were unassisted.This systematic review demonstrates that a majority of quit attempts in population-based studies to date are unassisted. However, across and within countries over time, it appears that there is a trend toward lower prevalence of making quit attempts without reported assistance or intervention.Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to explore the mechanisms behind sustained changes in behavior and involved qualitative interviews with 34 `success stories' who had either lost weight through changes in diet and exercise (n = 24) or stopped smoking (n = 10) and had maintained this change for at least 3 years. The results showed that the majority described how their sustained behavior change had been triggered by a significant life crisis relating to their health, relationships or salient milestones. This initial change was then translated into sustained change if three sustaining conditions were met: the function of the unhealthy behavior was disrupted, the individual perceived that their choice over carrying out the unhealthy behavior had been reduced and they adhered to a behavioral model of their problem. Further, these conditions functioned by enabling a process of reinvention with participants showing a shift in identity toward a new healthier self.

Case studies of women are presented to illustrate reasons for quitting, harm reduction practices, and factors influencing relapse and smoking continuation. Women's motivations to quit are highlighted. Moral identity as a mother was found to be a key motivating factor behind women's quit attempts.

A Systematic Review of the Qualitative Evidence,Andrea Smith,A qualitative inquiry into smoking cessation lessons learned from smokers Graduate School of Emory University,"[""A Kluge""]","This project explores why persistent smokers have failed to quit smoking despite the behavioral and pharmacological interventions that are available. Beginning with an historical overview of how cigarettes became popular in the United States, this dissertation further investigates the shift from behaviorally based therapies to pharmacological treatments. Initially smoking was understood as a morally reprehensible behavior in need of modification. With the ever increasing knowledge of nicotine's effects on the smoker's brain, researchers began to understand and treat smoking as a nicotine dependence disorder. However, long-term successful treatment rates remain modest. The question of why cessation tools have overwhelmingly failed smokers stands at the forefront of the inquiry. This dissertation adds an important component to smoking cessation research. Drawing on qualitative data collected for the Persistent Smokers Project, the analysis of the interviews reveals that there are three recurring themes associated with quitting smoking. First, interviewees provide important information on cessation motivators. Second, participants in the study focus on smoking cessation barriers that keep them from initiating a quit attempt. Third, smokers identify relapse triggers that end a period of smoking abstinence. Overall, these interviewees confirm much of what is already known in the research literature. However, the analysis also adds important knowledge in all three cessation areas and is able to offer an in-depth perspective of smokers' experiences with cessation. The qualitative findings are used to make recommendations for public health practices and research.","#AUTHOR_TAG While completing that review we determined that the available qualitative research was concerned primarily with evaluating smoker and ex-smoker perceptions of mass-reach interventions such as marketing or retail regulations, tax increases, graphic health warnings, smoke-free legislation or intervention acceptability from the perspective of the GP, current smoker, or third parties likely to be impacted by mass-reach interventions.","['The enduring popularity of unassisted cessation persists even in nations advanced in tobacco control where cessation assistance such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and the stop-smoking medications, bupropion and varenicline, are readily available and widely promoted.', '[9,10] Yet little appears to be known about this population or this self-guided route to cessation success.', 'In contrast, the phenomenon of self-change (also known as natural recovery) is comparatively well documented in the fields of drug and alcohol addiction, [12,13] and health behaviour change (for example, eating disorders, obesity and gambling).', '[14] We recently published a systematic review of unassisted cessation in Australia.', '[9] We, like others, [15] established that the majority of contemporary cessation research is quantitative and intervention focused.', '#AUTHOR_TAG While completing that review we determined that the available qualitative research was concerned primarily with evaluating smoker and ex-smoker perceptions of mass-reach interventions such as marketing or retail regulations, tax increases, graphic health warnings, smoke-free legislation or intervention acceptability from the perspective of the GP, current smoker, or third parties likely to be impacted by mass-reach interventions.', 'Australian smoking cessation research provided few insights into quitting from the perspective of the smoker who quits unassisted.', 'However our systematic review highlighted that 54% to 69% of ex-smokers quit unassisted and 41% to 58% of current smokers had attempted to quit unassisted.', '[9] We consequently became interested in what the qualitative cessation literature had to say about smokers who quit unassisted.', 'Qualitative approaches offer an opportunity to explain unexpected or anomalous findings from quantitative research and to clarify relationships identified in these studies.', '[17,18] By integrating individual qualitative research studies into a qualitative synthesis, new insights and understandings can be generated and a cumulative body of empirical work produced.', '[19] Such syntheses have proven useful to health policy and practice.', '[20,21] By focusing our review on the views of smokers (i.e. on the people to whom the interventions are directed), we might start to better understand why many smokers continue to quit unassisted instead of using the assistance available to them.', 'Such an understanding might help us to decide whether we should be developing better approaches to unassisted cessation or focusing our attention on directing more smokers to use the efficacious pharmacological and professional behavioural support that already exists.']",0,"['#AUTHOR_TAG While completing that review we determined that the available qualitative research was concerned primarily with evaluating smoker and ex-smoker perceptions of mass-reach interventions such as marketing or retail regulations, tax increases, graphic health warnings, smoke-free legislation or intervention acceptability from the perspective of the GP, current smoker, or third parties likely to be impacted by mass-reach interventions.', 'Australian smoking cessation research provided few insights into quitting from the perspective of the smoker who quits unassisted.', 'However our systematic review highlighted that 54% to 69% of ex-smokers quit unassisted and 41% to 58% of current smokers had attempted to quit unassisted.', '[9] We consequently became interested in what the qualitative cessation literature had to say about smokers who quit unassisted.']"

Meta-ethnography is one of several methods for synthesising qualitative research and is being used increasingly within health care research. However, many aspects of the steps in the process remain ill-defined.We utilized the seven stages of the synthesis process to synthesise qualitative research on adherence to tuberculosis treatment. In this paper we discuss the methodological and practical challenges faced; of particular note are the methods used in our synthesis, the additional steps that we found useful in clarifying the process, and the key methodological challenges encountered in implementing the meta-ethnographic approach.

To advance the goal of increasing successful cessation at the population level, it is imperative that we understand more about smokers' use of cessation methods, as well as the helpfulness of those methods in real-world experiences of quitting. In this survey of recent quitters, we simultaneously examined rates of use and perceived helpfulness of various cessation methods.Recent quitters (within 12 months; n = 1097) completed a telephone survey including questions relating to 13 cessation methods. Indices of use and perceived helpfulness for each method were plotted in a quadrant analysis. Socio-demographic differences were explored using bivariate and multivariate analyses.From the quadrant analysis, cold turkey, NRT and gradual reduction before quitting had high use and helpfulness; GP advice had high use and lower helpfulness. Prescribed medication and online programs had low use but high helpfulness. Remaining methods had low use and helpfulness. Younger quitters were more likely to use unassisted methods such as cold turkey; older or less educated quitters were more likely to use assisted methods such as prescribed medication or advice from a general practitioner.The majority of recent quitters quit cold turkey or cut down before quitting, and reported that these methods were helpful.

Location Five statutory and non-statutory alcohol problems treatment agencies in three areas of England and Wales. Data Open-ended interviews conducted according to a brief interview guide, leading to 400-800-word post-interview reports used for analysis (tape-recordings used for auditing purposes).Reports analysed by a team according to grounded theory principles, involving an iterative process with successive refinement of interviewing and analysis with each successive batch of data.A model of change from the clients' perspective was developed. Treatment was seen by clients as facilitating various changes in ways of thinking and/or increased support of various kinds from family and friends, along with new ways of acting in relation to drinking or more generally. For many those changes had led to an appreciation of the benefits accruing to them. Treatment was seen as part of a broader treatment system which included pretreatment assessment, forms of help additional to the trial treatment, plus an element of self-directed change during and following treatment. Taken with awareness of worsening alcohol-related harms, triggering events and external influence to seek treatment (the catalyst system), to which clients continued to refer following treatment, the change process is depicted as a complex, ongoing set of systems in which a trial treatment is embedded.Models of change should be broadened so that treatment is seen as a complex system of parts, facilitating a nexus of cognitive, social and behavioural changes, embedded within a broader system of events and processes catalysing change.

The argument is not successful, but it reveals an interesting connection between the humean view of practical reason and our concepts of self governance and self determination. It shows that on the humean view of practical reason the same relations or processes that ground autonomous action and determine what we have reason to do also (partly) determine who we have reason to be. Rationally endorsed desires determine on the humean view which action of ours is autonomous and what we have reason to do. The lesson from Parfit's and Dancy's argument is that rationally endorsed desires are also normatively self determining; they provide the normative foundation for their own retention. Commentators have often wondered how, according to humeans, could our practical identity, whose causal history is normatively arbitrary, ground our reasons for action. The humean answer is that parts of our practical identity - namely, our rationally endorsed desires - justify their own retention and are thus normatively non-arbitrary.

However, qualitative evidence can be difficult to search for and identify, and the effectiveness of different types of search strategies is unknown.    METHODS:  Three search strategies for qualitative research in the example area of support for breast-feeding were evaluated using six electronic bibliographic databases. The strategies were based on using thesaurus terms, free-text terms and broad-based terms. These strategies were combined with recognised search terms for support for breast-feeding previously used in a Cochrane review. For each strategy, we evaluated the recall (potentially relevant records found) and precision (actually relevant records found).    RESULTS:   A total yield of 7420 potentially relevant records was retrieved by the three strategies combined. Of these, 262 were judged relevant. Using one strategy alone would miss relevant records. The broad-based strategy had the highest recall and the thesaurus strategy the highest precision. Precision was generally poor: 96% of records initially identified as potentially relevant were deemed irrelevant. Searching for qualitative research involves trade-offs between recall and precision.    CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that strategies that attempt to maximise the number of potentially relevant records found are likely to result in a large number of false positives. The findings also suggest that a range of search terms is required to optimise searching for qualitative evidence.

Consistent with the TTM, measures of self-efficacy were related to making an attempt and to achieving 7 + days of abstinence. Contrary to the TTM, the behavioral change processes were unrelated to making quit attempts and to short-term abstinence, with the exception of self-liberation, which is conceptually related to self-efficacy. New non-TTM measures assessing commitment to quitting were predictive of outcomes.

We aimed to compare three methods for appraising qualitative research papers that were candidates for inclusion in a systematic review of evidence on support for breast-feeding.A sample of 12 research papers on support for breast-feeding was appraised by six qualitative reviewers using three appraisal methods: unprompted judgement, based on expert opinion; a UK Cabinet Office quality framework; and CASP, a Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. Papers were assigned, following appraisals, to 1 of 5 categories, which were dichotomized to indicate whether or not papers should be included in a systematic review. Patterns of agreement in categorization of papers were assessed quantitatively using kappa statistics, and qualitatively using cross-case analysis.Agreement in categorizing papers across the three methods was slight (kappa =0.13; 95% CI 0.06-0.24). Structured approaches did not appear to yield higher agreement than that by unprompted judgement. Qualitative analysis revealed reviewers' dilemmas in deciding between the potential impact of findings and the quality of the research execution or reporting practice. Structured instruments appeared to make reviewers more explicit about the reasons for their judgements.Structured approaches may not produce greater consistency of judgements about whether to include qualitative papers in a systematic review.

Using a transtheoretical model of change developed by Prochaska (1979) six verbal and four behavioral processes of change and three stages of change (Decision to Change; Active Change; Maintenance) were analyzed. Subjects in each treatment group were middle class, heavy-smoking adults. The change-process analysis of cessation discriminated between the self-quitters and therapy quitters and between the two groups of therapy subjects on five variables. Stages of change interacted with the processes of change in the cessation of smoking behavior. Verbal processes were seen as important in making the decision to change while action processes were critical for breaking the actual smoking habit.

METHODS Data are from three wave-to-wave transitions of the International Tobacco Control Four (ITC-4) country project. Smokers' responses at one wave were used to predict the likelihood of making an attempt and among those trying the likelihood of maintaining an attempt for at least a month at the next wave. For both outcomes, hierarchical logistic regressions were used to explore the predictive capacity of seven measures of motivation to quit smoking, controlling for a range of other known or possible predictors.   RESULTS Bivariate analyses indicate that measures of motivation to quit are predictive of making quit attempts, but they predict relapse among those making attempts. Multivariate analyses identified wanting to quit and frequency of prematurely butting out cigarettes as the main positive predictors of making attempts, but this was reduced by intention and recency of last attempt. For maintenance, premature butting out was the main motivation variable predicting relapse and was essentially unaffected by other measures.   DISCUSSION The findings show that it is wrong to suggest that all one needs to quit is to be motivated to do so. The reality is that one needs to be motivated to prompt action to stop smoking, but this is not sufficient in and of itself to ensure that cessation is maintained. These findings call attention to the importance of understanding the differential roles that prequit and postquit experiences play in smoking cessation and of providing help to smokers to stay off cigarettes.","[#AUTHOR_TAG,54] Motivation has been identified as critical to explaining cessation success.","[""Motivation was identified as a central concept in this review, but analysis of the studies showed that motivation appeared primarily in the researchers' accounts of quitting rather than in the smokers' accounts of quitting."", 'On closer examination, the data related to motivation consisted almost entirely of reasons for quitting.', 'Within the quantitative literature on smoking cessation, motivation is an established psychological construct which has been operationalised in numerous studies designed to determine the role of motivation in quitting success.', '[#AUTHOR_TAG,54] Motivation has been identified as critical to explaining cessation success.', '[55] The lack of explicit discussion about motivation by smokers who quit unassisted in the studies included in this review is therefore interesting.', ""Though motivation could be inferred from the smokers' accounts; it had to be done by using the variables that comprise motivation, such as reasons (motives) for quitting or the pros and cons of smoking versus quitting."", ""Given the relative lack of data, it is difficult to conclude whether this is (1) because smokers do not talk directly about motivation, or (2) whether from the participants' perspective motivation is not the driving force behind successful unassisted cessation (either because another concept is more important or because too much time has passed since their quit attempt for them and they have forgotten how important motivation was to them).""]",1,"[""Motivation was identified as a central concept in this review, but analysis of the studies showed that motivation appeared primarily in the researchers' accounts of quitting rather than in the smokers' accounts of quitting."", 'On closer examination, the data related to motivation consisted almost entirely of reasons for quitting.', 'Within the quantitative literature on smoking cessation, motivation is an established psychological construct which has been operationalised in numerous studies designed to determine the role of motivation in quitting success.', '[#AUTHOR_TAG,54] Motivation has been identified as critical to explaining cessation success.', '[55] The lack of explicit discussion about motivation by smokers who quit unassisted in the studies included in this review is therefore interesting.', ""Though motivation could be inferred from the smokers' accounts; it had to be done by using the variables that comprise motivation, such as reasons (motives) for quitting or the pros and cons of smoking versus quitting."", ""Given the relative lack of data, it is difficult to conclude whether this is (1) because smokers do not talk directly about motivation, or (2) whether from the participants' perspective motivation is not the driving force behind successful unassisted cessation (either because another concept is more important or because too much time has passed since their quit attempt for them and they have forgotten how important motivation was to them).""]"

Premature discontinuation and insufficient dosing have been offered as possible explanations. The aims are to (a) investigate the prevalence of and reasons for premature discontinuation of stop-smoking medications (including prescription only) and (b) how these differ by type, duration of use, and source (prescription or OTC).The sample includes 1,219 smokers or recent quitters who had used medication in the last year (80.5% NRT, 19.5% prescription only). Data were from Waves 5 and 6 of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four-Country Survey.Most of the sample (69.1%) discontinued medication use prematurely. This was more common among NRT users (71.4%) than in users of bupropion and varenicline (59.6%). OTC NRT users were particularly likely to discontinue (76.3%). Relapse back to smoking was the most common reason for discontinuation of medication reported by 41.6% of respondents. Side effects (18.3%) and believing that the medication was no longer needed (17.1%) were also commonly reported. Of those who completed treatment, 37.9% achieved 6-month continuous abstinence compared with 15.6% who discontinued prematurely. Notably, 65.6% who discontinued because they believed the medication had worked were abstinent.Premature discontinuation of stop-smoking medications is common but is not a plausible reason for poorer quit outcomes for most people. Encouraging persistence of medication use after relapse or in the face of minor side effects may help increase long-term cessation outcomes.","#AUTHOR_TAG Further complicating the relationship, some regard commitment as a component of motivation, [57] operationalizing motivation as, for example, 'determination to quit' [58] or 'commitment to quit'.","[""From the studies included in this review, it appears that-at least in smokers' self-understanding-commitment might be more important than motivation as an explanation of successful unassisted cessation."", 'The enthusiastic and explicit talk about being determined, committed, or serious suggests that this concept resonates more with smokers than the concept of motivation.', 'The overlapping and at times contradictory natures of commitment and motivation have been highlighted recently by Balmford and Borland who concluded that it may be possible to quit successfully while ambivalent, as long as the smoker remains committed in the face of ebbs and flows in motivation.', ""#AUTHOR_TAG Further complicating the relationship, some regard commitment as a component of motivation, [57] operationalizing motivation as, for example, 'determination to quit' [58] or 'commitment to quit'."", '[59] The greater research interest in reasons for quitting or pros and cons of quitting (i.e., motivation) as opposed to commitment may be because motivation is simpler to measure, for example by asking people to rate or rank reasons, costs or benefits.', 'From a policy and practice perspective, it may also be easier to draw attention to these reasons, costs and benefits, rather than engage with commitment.', 'For example, mass media campaigns can remind smokers of why they should quit by pointing out the benefits to short-term and long-term health.', 'However this review draws attention to the importance of commitment for sustained quitting, at least from the point of view of smokers and quitters.', ""The UK's annual Stoptober campaign in which smokers committed to being smoke-free for 28 days indicates that creative approaches to addressing commitment can be successful."", '[60] The final concept identified, willpower, was described in terms of multiple constructs (a personal quality or trait, a method of quitting, a strategy to counteract cravings or urges), suggesting smokers and researchers may use it as a convenient or shorthand heuristic when talking about or reporting on quit success.', 'Despite this lack of clarity, the word has persisted in the qualitative and quantitative smoking cessation literature.', 'It could be fruitful for future research to further examine the meaning of willpower, and particularly its relationship to other more tightly defined concepts such as self-efficacy, [61] self-regulation[62] and self-determination, [63] from the perspective of both researchers and smokers.']",2,"[""From the studies included in this review, it appears that-at least in smokers' self-understanding-commitment might be more important than motivation as an explanation of successful unassisted cessation."", 'The enthusiastic and explicit talk about being determined, committed, or serious suggests that this concept resonates more with smokers than the concept of motivation.', ""#AUTHOR_TAG Further complicating the relationship, some regard commitment as a component of motivation, [57] operationalizing motivation as, for example, 'determination to quit' [58] or 'commitment to quit'."", '[59] The greater research interest in reasons for quitting or pros and cons of quitting (i.e., motivation) as opposed to commitment may be because motivation is simpler to measure, for example by asking people to rate or rank reasons, costs or benefits.']"

Such advice may be brief, or part of more intensive interventions. Objectives The aims of this review were to assess the effectiveness of advice from physicians in promoting smoking cessation; to compare minimal interventions by physicians with more intensive interventions; to assess the effectiveness of various aids to advice in promoting smoking cessation, and to determine the effect of anti_smoking advice on disease_specific and all_cause mortality. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in January 2013 for trials of interventions involving physicians. We also searched Latin American databases through BVS (Virtual Library in Health) in February 2013. Selection criteria Randomised trials of smoking cessation advice from a medical practitioner in which abstinence was assessed at least six months after advice was first provided. Data collection and analysis We extracted data in duplicate on the setting in which advice was given, type of advice given (minimal or intensive), and whether aids to advice were used, the outcome measures, method of randomisation and completeness of follow_up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow_up. We also considered the effect of advice on mortality where long_term follow_up data were available. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. People lost to follow_up were counted as smokers. Effects were expressed as relative risks. Where possible, we performed meta_analysis using a Mantel_Haenszel fixed_effect model. Main results We identified 42 trials, conducted between 1972 and 2012, including over 31,000 smokers. In some trials, participants were at risk of specified diseases (chest disease, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease), but most were from unselected populations. The most common setting for delivery of advice was primary care. Other settings included hospital wards and outpatient clinics, and industrial clinics. Pooled data from 17 trials of brief advice versus no advice (or usual care) detected a significant increase in the rate of quitting (relative risk (RR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to 1.94). Amongst 11 trials where the intervention was judged to be more intensive the estimated effect was higher (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.13) but there was no statistical difference between the intensive and minimal subgroups. Direct comparison of intensive versus minimal advice showed a small advantage of intensive advice (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.56). Direct comparison also suggested a small benefit of follow_up visits. Only one study determined the effect of smoking advice on mortality. This study found no statistically significant differences in death rates at 20 years follow_up. Authors' conclusions Simple advice has a small effect on cessation rates. Assuming an unassisted quit rate of 2 to 3%, a brief advice intervention can increase quitting by a further 1 to 3%. Additional components appear to have only a small effect, though there is a small additional benefit of more intensive interventions compared to very brief interventions.","Yet, although these interventions are efficacious, [6][7]#AUTHOR_TAG the majority of smokers who quit successfully do so without using them, choosing instead to quit unassisted, that is without pharmacological or professional support.","['Research into smoking cessation has achieved much.', 'Researchers have identified numerous variables related to smoking cessation and relapse, including heaviness-of-smoking, quitting history, quit intentions, quit attempts, use of assistance, socio-economic status, gender, age, and exposure to mass-reach interventions such as mass media campaigns, price increases or retail regulation.', '[1] Behavioural scientists have developed a range of health behaviour models and constructs relevant to smoking cessation, such as the theory of planned behaviour, social cognitive theory, the transtheoretical model and the health belief model.', '[2][3][4][5] These theories have provided constructs to smoking cessation research such as perceived behavioural control, subjective norms, [2] outcome expectations, self-regulation, [3] decisional balance, [4] perceived benefits, perceived barriers and self-efficacy.', '[5] The knowledge generated has informed the development of a range of pharmacological and behavioural smoking cessation interventions.', 'Yet, although these interventions are efficacious, [6][7]#AUTHOR_TAG the majority of smokers who quit successfully do so without using them, choosing instead to quit unassisted, that is without pharmacological or professional support.', '[9,10] Many smokers also appear to quit unplanned as a consequence of serendipitous events, [11] throwing into question the predictive validity of some of these cognitive models.']",0,"['Research into smoking cessation has achieved much.', 'Yet, although these interventions are efficacious, [6][7]#AUTHOR_TAG the majority of smokers who quit successfully do so without using them, choosing instead to quit unassisted, that is without pharmacological or professional support.']"

In the Netherlands, the smoking prevalence rate is high. A total of 27.7% of the population over age 15 years smokes. In addition to the direct advantages of smoking cessation for the smoker, parents who quit smoking may also decrease their children's risk of smoking initiation. Methods/Design A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of proactive telephone counselling to increase smoking cessation rates among smoking parents. A total of 512 smoking parents will be proactively recruited through their children's primary schools and randomly assigned to either proactive telephone counselling or a control condition. Proactive telephone counselling will consist of up to seven counsellor-initiated telephone calls (based on cognitive-behavioural skill building and Motivational Interviewing), distributed over a period of three months. Three supplementary brochures will also be provided. In the control condition, parents will receive a standard brochure to aid smoking cessation. Assessments will take place at baseline, three months after start of the intervention (post-measurement), and twelve months after start of the intervention (follow-up measurement). Primary outcome measures will include sustained abstinence between post-measurement and follow-up measurement and 7-day point prevalence abstinence and 24-hours point prevalence abstinence at both post- and follow-up measurement. Several secondary outcome measures will also be included (e.g., smoking intensity, smoking policies at home). In addition, we will evaluate smoking-related cognitions (e.g., attitudes towards smoking, social norms, self-efficacy, intention to smoke) in 9-12 year old children of smoking parents. Discussion This study protocol describes the design of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of proactive telephone counselling in smoking cessation. It is expected that, in the telephone counseling condition, parental smoking cessation rates will be higher and children's cognitions will be less favorable about smoking compared to the control condition.

Each article was systematically classified for ""format"" (whether it was an original study, review article, general article, or case report), ""interest"" (whether or not it was of interest to the health care of humans), and ""purpose"" (whether it pertained to therapy, diagnosis, prognosis, causation, economics, costs, or clinical prediction; was of a qualitative nature; or was about something else). Search strategies were developed for all purpose categories, including qualitative studies.The sensitivity (recall), specificity, precision, and accuracy of single and combinations of search terms.49,028 articles were identified after matching the hand search records with the data downloaded from MEDLINE, of which 366 (0.75%) were classified as qualitative. Combinations of search terms reached peak sensitivities of 95%. Compared with the best single term, a three-term strategy increased sensitivity for qualitative studies by 23.6% (absolute increase), but with some loss of specificity when sensitivity was maximized. When search terms were combined to optimize sensitivity and specificity, both these values peaked above 90%.Several search strategies can achieve high performance in retrieving qualitative studies from MEDLINE.","[22] We used empirically derived qualitative research filters where available (MED-LINE, #AUTHOR_TAG CINAHL [24] and PsycINFO [25]) (Table 1).","['We searched MEDLINE via OvidSP, PsycINFO via OvidSP, CINAHL via EBSCO, EMBASE and Sociological Abstracts in September 2013 for articles reporting on views about or experiences of quitting without assistance.', 'Current best practice for identifying qualitative research recommends comprehensive searches of multiple sources, balancing sensitivity against specificity to maximise number of records retrieved while reducing retrieval of records that are not relevant.', '[22] We used empirically derived qualitative research filters where available (MED-LINE, #AUTHOR_TAG CINAHL [24] and PsycINFO [25]) (Table 1).', ""We complemented this search strategy by conducting 'berry picking', [26] including grey literature searching, reference checking and author searching to uncover articles that are difficult to locate by modifying search terms and shifting searching strategies (Fig 1).""]",5,"['[22] We used empirically derived qualitative research filters where available (MED-LINE, #AUTHOR_TAG CINAHL [24] and PsycINFO [25]) (Table 1).']"

The objective of this study was to develop optimal search strategies to retrieve qualitative studies in CINAHL for the 2000 publishing year. The authors conducted an analytic survey comparing hand searches of journals with retrievals from CINAHL for candidate search terms and combinations. Combinations of search terms reached peak sensitivities of 98.9% and peak specificities of 99.5%. Combining search terms optimized both sensitivity and specificity at 94.2%.

The authors tested multiple search strategies using 4,985 potential search terms in PsycINFO (Ovid Technologies) and compared the results with the hand search data to calculate retrieval effectiveness. A total of 125 qualitative studies were identified. Single-term and multiple-term strategies had sensitivities (maximizing retrieval of qualitative studies) up to 94.4% and specificities (minimizing retrieval of nonqualitative studies and reports) up to 98.6% with ranges of precision and accuracy.

For this purpose, we examine the effectiveness of a variety of features for determining the academic influence of a citation. By asking authors to identify the key references in their own work, we created a data set in which citations were labeled according to their academic influence. Using automatic feature selection with supervised machine learning, we found a model for predicting academic influence that achieves good performance on this data set using only four features. The best features, among those we evaluated, were those based on the number of times a reference is mentioned in the body of a citing paper. The performance of these features inspired us to design an influence-primed h-index (the hip-index). Unlike the conventional h-index, it weights citations by how many times a reference is mentioned.

A solution to this problem of data is available in the data base used to produce the Science Citation Index ( SCI ) (10). The coverage of the SCI is international and multidisciplinary; it has grown from 600 journals in 1964 to 2400 journals in 1972, and now includes the world's most important scientific and technical journals in mow disciplines. The SCI is published quarterly and is cumulated annually and quinquennially, but the data base from which the volumes are compiled is maintained on magnetic tape and is updated weekly. At the end of 1971, this data base contained more than 27 mi[tion references to about 10 million different published items. These references appeared over the past decade in the footnotes and bibliographies of more than 2 million journal articles, communications, letters, and so on. The data base is, thus, not only multidisciplinary, it covers a substantial period of time and, being in machine-readable form, is amenable to extensive manipulation by computer.

The open availability of large volumes of state-of-the-art knowledge online has the potential to provide huge savings and benefits in many fields. However, in order to fully leverage this knowledge, it is necessary to develop systems that (a) make it easy for users to discover and access this knowledge at the level of individual resources, (b) explore and analyse this knowledge at the level of collections of resources and (c) provide infrastructure and access to raw data in order to lower the barriers to the research and development of systems and services on top of this knowledge. In this paper, we argue why these requirements should be satisfied and show that current systems do not meet them. Consequently, we present the CORE (COnnecting REpositories) system, a large-scale Open Access aggregation, outlining its existing functionality and discussing the future technical development.

However, as far as the factors affecting normal wages are concerned, these inconsistencies may carry less weight than is usually believed.. The present paper aims to provide a critical overview of the controversy concerning the interpretation of the theory of wages in classical economists, offering a somewhat unusual perspective. I contend that there are major similarities between the two interpretations that have been regarded as the main contenders, the so-called New view and Fix wage interpretations. Due to these similarities, the controversy has tended to neglect a decisive point for the interpretation of the theory of wages in Ricardo and other classical economists, namely, the meaning of 'demand for labour' in classical thought. I also maintain that there is a third point of view concerning the interpretation of wage theory in the classical economists, which has not been accurately understood and discussed in earlier surveys of the controversy. Unlike the others, this Alternative interpretation, as I shall label it for brevity, centers on the absence of a systematic decreasing relation between real wages and employment in Ricardo and other classical economists.

The latter are modelled by allowing a workers marginal utility of leisure to be increasing in the leisure time taken by other workers. Coordination takes the form of internalising the leisure externality and other relevant constraints (e.g., labour demand). The extent of openness is measured by the degree of capital mobility. We find that: coordination lowers equilibrium work hours and raises the wage rate; there is a U-shaped (inverse-U-shaped) relationship between work hours (wages) and the degree of coordination; coordination is welfare improving; and, the gap between the coordinated and uncoordinated work hours (and the corresponding wage rates) is affected by the extent and nature of openness.coordination; corporatism; openness; capital mobility; social multiplier; welfare; work hours",This was taken up by #AUTHOR_TAG (1957) in an article written almost 60 years ago in which he offered an explanation for the decline in the length of the working week since the end of the nineteenth century.,"['x j x j x j ln(x j ) Equation ( 6) Equation ( 7) Equation ( 8) Equation ( 9 labour supply function.', 'Rarely is the basic identification question addressed: as a quantity (hours) and price (wage) relationship, why is this equation a supply function and not a demand function or some hybrid relation?', 'This was taken up by #AUTHOR_TAG (1957) in an article written almost 60 years ago in which he offered an explanation for the decline in the length of the working week since the end of the nineteenth century.', 'Although the real wages of production workers in US manufacturing industry follow an upwards trend (until the 1970s), average weekly hours of work decline until the Second World War and exhibit little or no trend after 1950.', ""Writing in the 1950s, to account for these movements, Lewis suggested that, 'to a first approximation', in a figure with the real wage on the vertical axis and the hours worked by an individual on the horizontal axis, the typical employer's demand for work hours is infinitely elastic at a given wage rate."", ""According to Lewis, the typical employer cares about the aggregate hours worked by the firm's entire work force but, at the given wage, the employer allows each worker to set his or her own work hours according to the worker's income-leisure preferences."", 'This horizontal demand curve for working hours shifted up over time as the economy grew, real incomes rose and the derived demand for labour increased.', 'The fact that, as wages rose, hours fell (at least until 1940) implies, with an assumed unchanged labour supply curve, that this supply curve is negatively sloped and the income effect of wage increases exceeds the substitution effect.', ""This was Lewis's justification for interpreting a regression of the hours of work of individuals on their real wages as a labour supply function.""]",5,"['x j x j x j ln(x j ) Equation ( 6) Equation ( 7) Equation ( 8) Equation ( 9 labour supply function.', 'This was taken up by #AUTHOR_TAG (1957) in an article written almost 60 years ago in which he offered an explanation for the decline in the length of the working week since the end of the nineteenth century.']"

Although the province of Nova Scotia, Canada is located in a region considered to have a high prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS), epidemiologic data are limited. Objective: We aimed to validate an administrative case definition for MS and to use this to estimate the incidence and prevalence of MS in Nova Scotia. Methods: We used provincial administrative claims data to identify persons with MS. We validated administrative case definitions using the clinical database of the province's only MS Clinic; agreement between data sources was expressed using a kappa statistic. We then applied these definitions to estimate the incidence and prevalence of MS from 1990 to 2010. Results: We selected the case definition using >=7 hospital or physician claims when >3 years of data were available, and >=3 claims where less data were available. Agreement between data sources was moderate (kappa = 0.56), while the positive predictive value was high (89%). In 2010, the age-standardized prevalence of MS per 100,000 population was 266.9 (95% CI: 257.1- 277.1) and incidence was 5.17 (95% CI: 3.78-6.56) per 100,000 persons/year. From 1990-2010 the prevalence of MS rose steadily but incidence remained stable. Conclusions: Administrative data provide a valid and readily available means of estimating MS incidence and prevalence. MS prevalence in Nova Scotia is among the highest in the world, similar to recent prevalence estimates elsewhere in Canada.","We aimed to estimate the incidence and prevalence of MS in BC, Canada using previously validated case definitions of MS [10,#AUTHOR_TAG] based on health administrative data.","['We aimed to estimate the incidence and prevalence of MS in BC, Canada using previously validated case definitions of MS [10,#AUTHOR_TAG] based on health administrative data.', 'Also, we described the demographics of the incident and prevalent cases and temporal changes in their characteristics including the sex ratio.']",5,"['We aimed to estimate the incidence and prevalence of MS in BC, Canada using previously validated case definitions of MS [10,#AUTHOR_TAG] based on health administrative data.', 'Also, we described the demographics of the incident and prevalent cases and temporal changes in their characteristics including the sex ratio.']"

We aimed to validate a case definition for MS using administrative health insurance data, and to describe the incidence and prevalence of MS in Manitoba, Canada.We used provincial administrative claims data to identify persons with demyelinating disease using International Classification of Diseases 9/10 codes and prescription claims. To validate the case definition, questionnaires were mailed to 2,000 randomly selected persons with an encounter for demyelinating disease, requesting permission for medical records review. We used diagnoses abstracted from medical records as the gold standard to evaluate candidate case definitions using administrative data.From 1984 to 1997, cases of MS using claims data were defined as persons with > or = 7 medical contacts for MS. From 1998 onward, cases were defined as persons with > or = 3 medical contacts. As compared to medical records, this definition had a positive predictive value of 80.5% and negative predictive value of 75.5%. From 1998 to 2006, the average age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence of MS per 100,000 population was 11.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.7-12.0). The age-adjusted prevalence of MS per 100,000 population increased from 32.6 (95% CI 29.4-35.8) in 1984 to 226.7 (95% CI 218.1-235.3) in 2006, with the peak prevalence shifting to older age groups.The prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Manitoba is among the highest in the world. The rising prevalence with minimally changing incidence suggests improving survival.

We systematically reviewed MS incidence and prevalence in these regions including a standardized evaluation of study quality.   METHODS We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for studies of MS prevalence or incidence in Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand published in English or French between January 1, 1985 and January 31, 2011. Study quality was assessed using a standardized tool. All steps of the review were performed in duplicate.   RESULTS Of 3925 citations identified, 28 studies met inclusion criteria and 21 of these were from Asia. Quality scores ranged from 1/8 to 8/8; the lowest scores were observed in studies from Asia (median 4/8, IQR 3,6). Prevalence was lowest in South African Blacks (0.22/100,000) and highest amongst Australian-born individuals in Australia (125/100,000). Prevalence increased over time in many countries. MS prevalence increased with increasing latitude only in some regions, and prevalence varied significantly with ethnicity. Eight studies reported incidence, which ranged from 0.67/100,000/year in Taiwan to 3.67/100,00/year in Australia.   CONCLUSIONS This comprehensive study provides an update of MS epidemiology in Africa, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Incidence and prevalence were lowest in Africa and Asia and highest in Australia, but many Asian studies were of poor quality. Use of consistent case ascertainment methods, standardized data collection tools, and similar outcomes would all improve study quality and comparability. The underlying basis of observed ethnic differences is an important area for future study.","It is estimated that more than two million people live with this disease worldwide [1], although the incidence and prevalence vary geographically [2][3]#AUTHOR_TAG.","['Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic, debilitating disease of the central nervous system, is the leading cause of nontraumatic disability in young adults [1].', 'It is estimated that more than two million people live with this disease worldwide [1], although the incidence and prevalence vary geographically [2][3]#AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Furthermore, reports of recent increases in the incidence and prevalence, and in the ratio of women to men with MS, have been inconsistent across regions [5][6][7].']",0,"['It is estimated that more than two million people live with this disease worldwide [1], although the incidence and prevalence vary geographically [2][3]#AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Furthermore, reports of recent increases in the incidence and prevalence, and in the ratio of women to men with MS, have been inconsistent across regions [5][6][7].']"

No previous study has performed a comprehensive review examining the incidence and prevalence of MS across the Americas. The purpose of this study was to systematically review and assess the quality of studies estimating the incidence and/or prevalence of MS in North, Central and South American regions. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE from January 1985 to January 2011. Search terms included 'multiple sclerosis', 'incidence', 'prevalence' and 'epidemiology'. Only full-text articles published in English or French were included. Study quality was assessed using an assessment tool based on recognized guidelines and designed specifically for this study. Results: A total of 3,925 studies were initially identified, with 31 meeting the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies examined North American regions (n = 25). Heterogeneity was high among all studies, even when stratified by country. Only half of the studies reported standardized rates, making comparisons difficult. Quality scores ranged from 3/8 to 8/8. Conclusion: This review highlights the gaps that still exist in the epidemiological knowledge of MS in the Americas, and the inconsistencies in methodologies and quality among the published studies. There is a need for future studies of MS prevalence and incidence to include uniform case definitions, employ comparable methods of ascertainment, report standardized results, and be performed on a national level.

We then developed and validated different combinations of administrative data for algorithms. The most accurate algorithm was used to estimate the burden and epidemiology of MS over time.The accuracy of the algorithm of one hospitalisation or five physician billings over 2 years provided both high sensitivity (84%) and positive predictive value (86%). Application of this algorithm to provincial data demonstrated an increasing cumulative burden of MS, from 13,326 patients (0.14%) in 2000 to 24,647 patients in 2010 (0.22%).

Prevalence and incidence surveys could be affected by inaccuracy of diagnosis and ascertainment, and prevalence also depends on survival. These sources of error might play a part in the geographical and temporal variations. Our literature search and meta-regression analyses indicated an almost universal increase in prevalence and incidence of MS over time; they challenge the well accepted theory of a latitudinal gradient of incidence of MS in Europe and North America, while this gradient is still apparent for Australia and New Zealand; and suggest a general, although not ubiquitous, increase in incidence of MS in females. The latter observation should prompt epidemiological studies to focus on changes in lifestyle in females. New insights into gene-environment and gene-gene interactions complicate interpretations of demographic epidemiology and have made obsolete the idea of simple causative associations between genes or the environment and MS.","Furthermore, reports of recent increases in the incidence and prevalence, and in the ratio of women to men with MS, have been inconsistent across regions [5]#AUTHOR_TAG[7].","['Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic, debilitating disease of the central nervous system, is the leading cause of nontraumatic disability in young adults [1].', 'It is estimated that more than two million people live with this disease worldwide [1], although the incidence and prevalence vary geographically [2][3][4].', 'Furthermore, reports of recent increases in the incidence and prevalence, and in the ratio of women to men with MS, have been inconsistent across regions [5]#AUTHOR_TAG[7].']",2,"['Furthermore, reports of recent increases in the incidence and prevalence, and in the ratio of women to men with MS, have been inconsistent across regions [5]#AUTHOR_TAG[7].']"

Alonso"", ""M. A. Hernan""]","Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) has been traditionally considered to be more frequent in women and in regions more distant from the equator. However, recent reports suggest that the latitude gradient could be disappearing and that the female-to-male ratio among patients with MS has increased in the last decades. We have conducted a systematic review of incidence studies of MS to assess the overall incidence of MS and explore possible changes in the latitude gradient and the female-to-male ratio over time. Methods: Systematic review of incidence studies of MS published in Medline between 1966 and February 2007. Age- and sex-specific incidence rates were collected from eligible publications. We computed age-adjusted rates using the world population as standard, and assessed differences in rates according to latitude and period of case ascertainment. Additionally, we evaluated the association between period of case ascertainment and the female-to-male ratio. Results: The overall incidence rate of MS was 3.6 cases per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 3.0, 4.2) in women and 2.0 (95% CI 1.5, 2.4) in men. Higher latitude was associated with higher MS incidence, though this latitude gradient was attenuated after 1980, apparently due to increased incidence of MS in lower latitudes. The female-to-male ratio in MS incidence increased over time, from an estimated 1.4 in 1955 to 2.3 in 2000. Conclusion: The latitude gradient present in older incidence studies of multiple sclerosis (MS) is decreasing. The female-to-male MS ratio has increased in the last five decades.","Furthermore, reports of recent increases in the incidence and prevalence, and in the ratio of women to men with MS, have been inconsistent across regions #AUTHOR_TAG[6][7].","['Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic, debilitating disease of the central nervous system, is the leading cause of nontraumatic disability in young adults [1].', 'It is estimated that more than two million people live with this disease worldwide [1], although the incidence and prevalence vary geographically [2][3][4].', 'Furthermore, reports of recent increases in the incidence and prevalence, and in the ratio of women to men with MS, have been inconsistent across regions #AUTHOR_TAG[6][7].']",2,"['Furthermore, reports of recent increases in the incidence and prevalence, and in the ratio of women to men with MS, have been inconsistent across regions #AUTHOR_TAG[6][7].']"

Clinical and demographic data of MS patients registered with the British Columbia MS clinics (1980-2004) were linked to provincial death data, and patients were followed until death, emigration or study end (31 December 2007). Absolute survival and the influence of patient characteristics (sex, disease course (primary progressive (PPMS) vs relapsing onset (R-MS)) and onset age) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analyses (from birth and disease onset). Mortality relative to the general population was examined using standardised mortality ratios. Excess mortality associated with patient characteristics and time period of cohort entry was assessed by relative survival modelling. Of 6917 patients, 1025 died. Median survival age was 78.6 years (95% CI 77.5 to 79.7) for women and 74.3 years (95% CI 73.1 to 75.4) for men. Survival from onset was longer for R-MS (49.7 years; 95% CI 47.9 to 51.5) than for PPMS (32.5 years; 95% CI 29.5 to 35.7); however, survival age was similar. The overall standardised mortality ratios was 2.89 (95% CI 2.71 to 3.07), and patients survived approximately 6 years less than expected, relative to the general population. PPMS had a higher relative mortality risk compared with R-MS (relative mortality ratio (RMR) 1.52; 95% CI 1.30 to 1.80).

Methods: We identified potential cases of diabetes from physician claims, hospitalizations and prescription drug records between 1992/1993 and 2007/2008 using the three different case definitions, which included a national standard as well as two regionally developed case definitions. Each case definition used a different combination of administrative data; however, only one definition used prescription drug records. The sensitivity of each definition was calculated against the 'gold standard' of diagnosed cases recorded in British Columbia's Children's Hospital Endocrinology and Diabetes Unit clinical database. Results: During this time period, 2611 patients were seen at the British Columbia's Children's Hospital. The sensitivities (95% CIs) of the national and two regional case definitions were 0.95 (0.941-0.958), 0.97 (0.964-0.977) and 0.82 (0.800-0.830), respectively.

Nevertheless, only a few studies to date have measured the burden imposed by MS on society in The Netherlands.To estimate the cost and quality-of-life associated with MS in The Netherlands, while focusing on the burden of relapses and increasing disease severity.MS patients in The Netherlands (n = 263) completed a web-based questionnaire which captured information on demographics, disease characteristics and severity (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]), co-morbidities, relapses, resource consumption, utilities, fatigue and activities of daily living (ADL).Most patients included in the study were receiving treatment for MS (76% of the sample). The mean cost per patient per year increased with worsening disability and was estimated at EUR30,938, EUR51,056, and EUR100,469 for patients with mild (EDSS 0-3), moderate (EDSS 4-6.5), and severe (EDSS 7-9) disability, respectively. The excess cost of relapses was estimated at EUR8195 among relapsing-remitting patients with EDSS score <=5. The quality-of-life of patients decreased with disease progression and existence of relapses.The cost of MS in The Netherlands was higher compared to the results of previous studies. The TRIBUNE study provides an important update on the economic burden of MS in The Netherlands in an era of more widespread use of disease-modifying therapies. It explores the cost of MS linked to relapses and disease severity and examines the impact of MS on additional health outcomes beyond utilities such as ADL and fatigue.Patients were selected from specialized treatment centers, therefore this sample may not be representative of the entire MS population in The Netherlands, i.e., few patients not receiving MS therapies were included. In addition, only a few patients with severe disability were included in the study sample; therefore, results for this disease severity sub-group should be interpreted with caution.","This proportion may seem low, particularly when compared to a previous estimate (73-85 %) derived from a volunteer sample of patients recruited from Canadian MS treatment centres #AUTHOR_TAG.","['Approximately, one-third of incident or prevalent MS cases filled a prescription for a DMD during the study period, stabilizing from the year 2000 onwards.', 'This proportion may seem low, particularly when compared to a previous estimate (73-85 %) derived from a volunteer sample of patients recruited from Canadian MS treatment centres #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'However, our proportion was derived from population-based rather than clinic-based data, the first DMD (interferon beta-1b) was only approved for use in Canada in 1995, and not all individuals with MS would have been eligible for treatment (including those unable to walk, those without relapses and those with a primary progressive disease course).', 'Thus, it is likely that our data provide a realistic representation of DMD use in the British Columbian MS population over the study period.']",1,"['This proportion may seem low, particularly when compared to a previous estimate (73-85 %) derived from a volunteer sample of patients recruited from Canadian MS treatment centres #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'However, our proportion was derived from population-based rather than clinic-based data, the first DMD (interferon beta-1b) was only approved for use in Canada in 1995, and not all individuals with MS would have been eligible for treatment (including those unable to walk, those without relapses and those with a primary progressive disease course).']"

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for articles in all languages published up until 23 August 2013. Twenty-one studies from 13 countries were included in the review. Heterogeneity of study settings precluded carrying out a meta-analysis, and a qualitative synthesis was performed instead. Five studies, all from more unequal countries, reported an association between high SES and MS. Thirteen studies reported no evidence of an association, and three studies reported an association with low SES. These 16 studies largely came from more egalitarian countries. The evidence for an association between high SES and increased MS risk is inconsistent but with some indication of a stronger effect in countries and time periods with higher inequality.

Green"", ""B. N. Yu"", ""R. A.

By using administrative health data, we identified all incident cases of MS in Manitoba from 1990 to 2006 (n = 2,290) and geocoded them to 230 neighborhoods in the City of Winnipeg and 268 municipalities in rural Manitoba. Age-standardized incidence rates for 1990-2006 (combined) were calculated for each region. By using the spatial scan statistic, we identified high-rate clusters in southwestern (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.48) and central Winnipeg (IRR = 1.54) and low-rate clusters in north-central Winnipeg (IRR = 0.52) and northern Manitoba (IRR = 0.48). Multivariable Poisson regression showed a positive association between MS incidence rates and socioeconomic status. Despite our finding that MS incidence varied geographically and by socioeconomic status, the low Gini coefficient of 0.152 for MS incidence identified in this study suggests that the causes of MS are pervasive across all population groups. Searching for local-level causes of the disease may therefore not be as productive as investigating etiological factors operating at the population level. This may require an examination of macro-level differences in environmental exposures between high- and low-incidence regions of the world.","Similar observations have been made in the past [30][31][32][33]#AUTHOR_TAG, although others have reported either no relationship or a negative association with SES [35].","['We observed a small difference in the distribution of cases across the socioeconomic quintiles, with a greater proportion of both incident and prevalent cases in the upper quintiles and fewer in the lower.', 'Similar observations have been made in the past [30][31][32][33]#AUTHOR_TAG, although others have reported either no relationship or a negative association with SES [35].']",1,"['We observed a small difference in the distribution of cases across the socioeconomic quintiles, with a greater proportion of both incident and prevalent cases in the upper quintiles and fewer in the lower.', 'Similar observations have been made in the past [30][31][32][33]#AUTHOR_TAG, although others have reported either no relationship or a negative association with SES [35].']"

The SES and SAN at age 10 were also systematically higher among patients, but significance was reached only when the frequencies of conditions indicating extremely low values of SES or SAN were compared.

Risk Factors for MS,"[""J. F. Kurtzke"", ""W. F. Page""]","In previous papers of this series, we explored the epidemiology of MS, examining the effects of race, sex, geography, latitude and climate, migration, age at onset, population ancestry, and individual ethnicity on the risk of MS, using an unusually large cohort of MS cases and pre-illness matched controls comprising US veterans of World War II (WWII) and the Korean Conflict (KC). In this paper, we examine primarily the effect of other factors on the risk of MS in this cohort and their relation to those previously studied. We found here that latitude tier of residence at entry into active duty (EAD), years of education, and socioeconomic class (coded from occupation) were similarly associated with MS risk among white men, black men, and white women. Higher levels of each factor showed increased MS risk. Multivariate analyses indicated that for white male WWII subjects an urban address, 9 or more years of education, uncorrected visual acuity less than 20/20 at EAD, a more northern latitude, and a higher proportion of the subject's EAD state population reporting Swedish ancestry each significantly increased the risk of MS. White male KC subjects showed roughly the same patterns, except that uncorrected visual acuity less than 20/20 was associated with lower MS risk (ancestry/ethnicity was not studied). For black male WWII and KC subjects combined, a similar analysis (omitting ancestry/ethnicity) showed that only latitude at EAD and 9 or more years of education were independently associated with a significantly higher MS risk, and for WWII plus KC white women (also without ancestry/ethnicity), only latitude was a significant risk factor in these multivariate analyses. The smaller number of subjects, especially in these last two groups, limited the power to detect statistically significant risks in these last analyses. Similarities to white men of WWII in univariate analyses for all other groups suggest that findings for the former would otherwise apply to the latter. Although the interpretations of these associations may be obscure, in addition to geography, age, sex, and race, per se, higher socioeconomic status is significantly associated with higher MS risk in black and white men and in white women in the United States.","Similar observations have been made in the past [30]#AUTHOR_TAG[32][33][34], although others have reported either no relationship or a negative association with SES [35].","['We observed a small difference in the distribution of cases across the socioeconomic quintiles, with a greater proportion of both incident and prevalent cases in the upper quintiles and fewer in the lower.', 'Similar observations have been made in the past [30]#AUTHOR_TAG[32][33][34], although others have reported either no relationship or a negative association with SES [35].']",1,"['We observed a small difference in the distribution of cases across the socioeconomic quintiles, with a greater proportion of both incident and prevalent cases in the upper quintiles and fewer in the lower.', 'Similar observations have been made in the past [30]#AUTHOR_TAG[32][33][34], although others have reported either no relationship or a negative association with SES [35].']"

We define and use four complementary types of affordance in the context of interaction design and evaluation: cognitive affordance, physical affordance, sensory affordance, and functional affordance. The terms cognitive affordance (Norman's perceived affordance) and physical affordance (Norman's real affordance) refer to parallel and equally important usability concepts for interaction design, to which sensory affordance plays a supporting role.

Although the flooding was deemed a 'wake-up call' to the impacts of climate change at the time, such claims are typically supported only by general thermodynamic arguments that suggest increased extreme precipitation under global warming, but fail to account fully for the complex hydrometeorology associated with flooding. Here we present a multi-step, physically based 'probabilistic event attribution' framework showing that it is very likely that global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions substantially increased the risk of flood occurrence in England and Wales in autumn 2000. Using publicly volunteered distributed computing, we generate several thousand seasonal-forecast-resolution climate model simulations of autumn 2000 weather, both under realistic conditions, and under conditions as they might have been had these greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting large-scale warming never occurred. Results are fed into a precipitation-runoff model that is used to simulate severe daily river runoff events in England and Wales (proxy indicators of flood events). The precise magnitude of the anthropogenic contribution remains uncertain, but in nine out of ten cases our model results indicate that twentieth-century anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions increased the risk of floods occurring in England and Wales in autumn 2000 by more than 20%, and in two out of three cases by more than 90%.","Under the assumption of an unchanging relationship between hazard and resulting damage, event probability can be seen as a proxy for risk (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2011).","['In recent years wet British summers have been reported frequently, with record-breaking rainfall in June in 2012 and a wet July following a wet spring, and the exceptionally rainy July in 2007, not record breaking in the monthly totals but with very intense shorter rain events within the month, which resulted in heavy summer floods in middle England and Wales.', 'Although large scale flooding held off in 2012, the extreme rain caused damage to the harvest and put strain on infrastructure systems.', 'However the heavy flooding in 2007, following very high daily and 5-day totals (with 3 top 12 5-day totals in July compared to the whole observed period, and the 5th highest total daily precipitation), was classified as a national disaster by the Environment Agency causing economic losses of approximately ��3 billion (Report Environment Agency UK, 2010).', 'There is no significant trend in July rainfall extremes,however, as extremes are by definition rare, a trend would only be detectable if the risk of extremes changed dramatically.', 'Trend analysis will thus not reveal subtle changes in extreme precipitation.', 'In times of anthropogenic climate change with increasing global mean temperatures the question arises if the observed extreme events were just bad luck or whether heavy rainfall in summer, especially in July, is something we have reasons to expect in the future and should begin adapting to in terms of infrastructure planning?', 'Even before a trend might be detectable, attribution analysis can reveal the influence of anthropogenic climate change on very rare events, and such is the aim of this paper.', 'July precipitation on a timescale relevant for flooding will be the focus of this study.', 'It is important to highlight here that precipitation in the relevant month, although important, is only one factor determining flood risk (Kay et al. 2011).', 'We attempt to answer the question of how the odds of extreme July precipitation relevant for flooding have changed, not the odds of floods occurring in July.', 'Increasingly, politicians, decision-makers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) want to know whether and to what extent global human-influenced climate change is affecting localised extreme weather events, highlighted by the fact that the Conference of the Party (COP) meeting in Doha in November 2012 established a work programme specifically on loss and damage due to climate change (UNFCCC report FCCC/SBI/2012/29 2012), further developed into the ""Warsaw mechanism"" at the COP in 2013.', 'Studies into the European heat wave of 2003(Stott et al. 2004, the England and Wales floods of 2000 (Pall et al. 2011), and the Russian heat wave of 2010 (Dole et al. 2011;Rahmstorf and Coumou 2011;Otto et al. 2012) have sought to determine to what extent the risks of these events occurring have changed because of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, many of them using the emerging method of probabilistic event attribution (PEA).', 'Under the assumption of an unchanging relationship between hazard and resulting damage, event probability can be seen as a proxy for risk (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2011).', 'One of the most recent series of studies in this field (Peterson et al. 2012;Peterson et al. 2013) attempts to answer this question for several extreme events that occurred in 2011 and 2012, with one of the studies being an attribution study of exceptionally warm Novembers in central England (Massey et al. 2012), which explicitly applies PEA.', 'It finds a 40 times increase in the risk of such warm Novembers occurring, when comparing simulated temperatures of the 2000s with the 1960s.', 'Pall et al.

Understanding the nature and drivers of this variability is an essential step in developing robust climate predictions and risk assessments. The Atlantic Ocean has been suggested as an important driver of variability in European climate on decadal timescales1, but the importance of this influence in recent decades has been unclear, partly because of difficulties in separating the influence of the Atlantic Ocean from other contributions, for example, from the tropical Pacific Ocean and the stratosphere. Here we analyse four data sets derived from observations to show that, during the 1990s, there was a substantial shift in European climate towards a pattern characterized by anomalously wet summers in northern Europe, and hot, dry, summers in southern Europe, with related shifts in spring and autumn. These changes in climate coincided with a substantial warming of the North Atlantic Ocean, towards a state last seen in the 1950s. The patterns of European climate change in the 1990s are consistent with earlier changes attributed to the influence of the North Atlantic Ocean, and provide compelling evidence that the Atlantic Ocean was the key driver. Our results suggest that the recent pattern of anomalies in European climate will persist as long as the North Atlantic Ocean remains anomalously warm","However, this does not apply for the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) pattern which switches modes only on decadal and longer timescales (#AUTHOR_TAG and Dong 2012).","['To achieve our aim of a probabilistic event attribution study of extreme July precipitation in England and Wales (such as led to severe flooding in large parts of central England, Northeast England and Wales), at least two climate model ensembles are required.', 'The first one is a historical ensemble using observed forcings and sea surface temperatures (SSTs), while the second is a counterfactual ensemble for the ""world that might have been"" without anthropogenic forcing.', 'Both ensembles must be sufficiently large to ensure that the statistical analysis of changes in extreme events is robust (e.g., Pall et al. 2011;Kay et al. 2011).', 'Some authors have also compared the change in event occurrence in model simulations between a recent decade (e.g., 2000s) and an earlier decade when the anthropogenic forcing was not as strong (e.g., 1960s) (e.g., Otto et al. 2012;Massey et al. 2012).', 'Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages.', 'A comparison of the 1960s with the 2000s does not allow for the changes in probability of occurrence of extreme events to be attributed to anthropogenic climate change alone as other climate conditions have been different in the two decades as well.', 'It does, however, allow for a validation of modelling results against observations.', 'Additionally comparing whole decades instead of ensembles of single years minimises the influence of large scale teleconnection patterns, e.g. the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), as decadal ensembles smooth interannual variability of such oscillations.', 'However, this does not apply for the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) pattern which switches modes only on decadal and longer timescales (#AUTHOR_TAG and Dong 2012).', 'Especially with respect to precipitation, which is resolvable for large scales but largely either not understood or not resolvable even in a regional climate model on local scales that are important for flooding, both aspects -the ability to validate the model and the reduced influence of specific SST patterns -are important.']",0,"['However, this does not apply for the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) pattern which switches modes only on decadal and longer timescales (#AUTHOR_TAG and Dong 2012).']"

Fowler"", ""Daniel Cooley"", ""Stephan R. Sain"", ""Milo Thurston""]","We investigate a question posed by policy makers, namely, ""when will changes in extreme precipitation due to climate change be detectable?"" To answer this question we use climateprediction.net (CPDN) model simulations from the BBC Climate Change Experiment (CCE) over the UK. These provide us with the unique opportunity to compare 1-day extreme precipitation generated from climate altered by observed forcings (time period 1920-2000) and the SRES A1B emissions scenario (time period 2000-2080) (the Scenario) to extreme precipitation generated by a constant climate for year 1920 (the Control) for the HadCM3L General Circulation Model (GCM). We fit non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models to the Scenario output and compare these to stationary GEV models fit to the parallel Control. We define the time of detectable change as the time at which we would reject a hypothesis at the a = 0.05 significance level that the 20-year return level of the two runs is equal. We find that the time of detectable change depends on the season, with most model runs indicating that change to winter extreme precipitation may be detectable by the year 2010, and that change to summer extreme precipitation is not detectable by 2080. We also investigate which climate model parameters affect the weight of the tail of the precipitation distribution and which affect the time of detectable change for the winter season. We find that two climate model parameters have an important effect on the tail weight, and two others seem to affect the time of detection. Importantly, we find that climate model simulated extreme precipitation has a fundamentally different behavior to observations, perhaps due to the negative estimate of the GEV shape parameter, unlike observations which produce a slightly positive (~0.0-0.2) estimate.","We concentrate our analysis on 5-day means which give the better distribution in the model and are furthermore an important indicator for flood risk (e.g, Fowler and Kilsby 2003;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2010).","[""Figure 1 shows quantile-quantile plots as a measure of the model's ability to represent the observed distribution of precipitation."", 'Both model (HadRM3P) and observational (HadEWP) data are shown in the two different decades,daily averages as well as the 5day average computed as a running 5-day mean are shown.', 'Pall et al.

HadISST1 and HadMAT1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto the reconstructions to restore local detail. The sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt effects on retrievals in the Arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the Antarctic and by making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. SSTs near sea ice are estimated using statistical relationships between SST and sea ice concentration.

Kilsby""]","Multi-day rainfall events are an important cause of recent severe flooding in the UK and any change in  the magnitude of such events may have severe impacts upon urban structures such as dams, urban  drainage systems and flood defences and cause failures to occur. Regional pooling of 1-, 2-, 5- and 10- day annual maxima for 1961 to 2000 from 204 sites across the UK is used in a standard regional  frequency analysis to produce GEV growth curves for long return-period rainfall events for each of nine  defined climatological regions. Temporal changes in 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-day annual maxima are examined  with L-moments using both a 10-year moving window and fixed decades from 1961-70, 1971-80, 1981- 90 and 1991-2000. A bootstrap technique is then used to assess uncertainty in the fitted decadal growth  curves and to identify significant trends in both distribution parameters and quantile estimates.    There has been a two-part change in extreme rainfall event occurrence across the UK from 1961-2000.  Little change is observed at 1- and 2-day duration, but significant decadal level changes are seen in 5- and  10-day events in many regions. In the south of the UK, growth curves have flattened and 5- and 10-day  annual maxima have decreased during the 1990s. However, in the north, the 10-day growth curve has  steepened and annual maxima have risen during the 1990s. This is particularly evident in Scotland. The  50-year event in Scotland during 1961-1990 has become an 8-, 11- and 25-year event in the Eastern,  Southern and Northern Scotland pooling regions respectively during the 1990s.

Kay"", ""S.M. Crooks"", ""P. Pall"", ""D.A. Stone""]","Summary Although no single weather-related event can be directly attributed to climate change, new techniques make it possible to estimate how much the chance of an event has been altered by anthropogenic emissions. This paper looks at the floods that occurred in England in Autumn/Winter 2000, by using large ensembles of 1-year climate model simulations representing April 2000-March 2001. These represent an industrial climate and four estimates of an hypothetical non-industrial climate (without historical greenhouse gas emissions), and are used to drive hydrological models for eight catchments in England. The simulated flows are used to assess the impact of historical emissions on the chance of occurrence of extreme floods in each catchment, through calculation of the fraction of attributable risk ( FAR ). Combining results for the four non-industrial climates, positive median values of FAR indicate that, for all but one catchment, emissions are likely to have led to an increased chance of flooding in the October-December period. Definitive conclusions are difficult however, as there are wide bands of uncertainty in FAR , with distributions generally spanning no attributable difference in risk ( FAR  = 0). One catchment shows a decreased flood chance (negative median FAR ), due to its high permeability, but an analysis of the effect of antecedent conditions shows that a longer period of climate data than 1 year is probably required to obtain more representative values of FAR for such catchments. The inclusion of snowfall/snowmelt is also shown to be important for floods over the October-March period, as the reduced likelihood of snowmelt-induced floods in the warmer temperatures of the industrial climate moderates the increased flood chance due to other sources of flooding.","It is important to highlight here that precipitation in the relevant month, although important, is only one factor determining flood risk (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2011).","['In recent years wet British summers have been reported frequently, with record-breaking rainfall in June in 2012 and a wet July following a wet spring, and the exceptionally rainy July in 2007, not record breaking in the monthly totals but with very intense shorter rain events within the month, which resulted in heavy summer floods in middle England and Wales.', 'Although large scale flooding held off in 2012, the extreme rain caused damage to the harvest and put strain on infrastructure systems.', 'However the heavy flooding in 2007, following very high daily and 5-day totals (with 3 top 12 5-day totals in July compared to the whole observed period, and the 5th highest total daily precipitation), was classified as a national disaster by the Environment Agency causing economic losses of approximately ��3 billion (Report Environment Agency UK, 2010).', 'There is no significant trend in July rainfall extremes,however, as extremes are by definition rare, a trend would only be detectable if the risk of extremes changed dramatically.', 'Trend analysis will thus not reveal subtle changes in extreme precipitation.', 'In times of anthropogenic climate change with increasing global mean temperatures the question arises if the observed extreme events were just bad luck or whether heavy rainfall in summer, especially in July, is something we have reasons to expect in the future and should begin adapting to in terms of infrastructure planning?', 'Even before a trend might be detectable, attribution analysis can reveal the influence of anthropogenic climate change on very rare events, and such is the aim of this paper.', 'July precipitation on a timescale relevant for flooding will be the focus of this study.', 'It is important to highlight here that precipitation in the relevant month, although important, is only one factor determining flood risk (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2011).', 'We attempt to answer the question of how the odds of extreme July precipitation relevant for flooding have changed, not the odds of floods occurring in July.', 'Increasingly, politicians, decision-makers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) want to know whether and to what extent global human-influenced climate change is affecting localised extreme weather events, highlighted by the fact that the Conference of the Party (COP) meeting in Doha in November 2012 established a work programme specifically on loss and damage due to climate change (UNFCCC report FCCC/SBI/2012/29 2012), further developed into the ""Warsaw mechanism"" at the COP in 2013.', 'Studies into the European heat wave of 2003(Stott et al. 2004, the England and Wales floods of 2000 (Pall et al. 2011), and the Russian heat wave of 2010 (Dole et al. 2011;Rahmstorf and Coumou 2011;Otto et al. 2012) have sought to determine to what extent the risks of these events occurring have changed because of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, many of them using the emerging method of probabilistic event attribution (PEA).', 'Under the assumption of an unchanging relationship between hazard and resulting damage, event probability can be seen as a proxy for risk (Pall et al. 2011).', 'One of the most recent series of studies in this field (Peterson et al. 2012;Peterson et al. 2013) attempts to answer this question for several extreme events that occurred in 2011 and 2012, with one of the studies being an attribution study of exceptionally warm Novembers in central England (Massey et al. 2012), which explicitly applies PEA.', 'It finds a 40 times increase in the risk of such warm Novembers occurring, when comparing simulated temperatures of the 2000s with the 1960s.', 'Pall et al.

Peterson"", ""Peter A. Stott"", ""Stephanie Herring""]","Attribution of extreme events shortly after their occurrence stretches the current state-of-theart of climate change assessment. To help foster the growth of this science, this article illustrates some approaches to answering questions about the role of human factors, and the relative role of different natural factors, for six specific extreme weather or climate events of 2011. Not every event is linked to climate change. The rainfall associated with the devastating Thailand floods can be explained by climate variability. But long-term warming played a part in the others. While La Ni–a contributed to the failure of the rains in the Horn of Africa, an increased frequency of such droughts there was linked to warming in the Western PacificÐ Indian Ocean warm pool. Europe's record warm temperatures would probably not have been as unusual if the high temperatures had been caused only by the atmospheric flow regime without any long-term warming. Calculating how the odds of a particular extreme event have changed provides a means of quantifying the influence of climate change on the event. The heatwave that affected Texas has become distinctly more likely than 40 years ago. In the same vein, the likelihood of very warm November temperatures in the UK has increased substantially since the 1960s. Comparing climate model simulations with and without human factors shows that the cold UK winter of 2010/2011 has become about half as likely as a result of human influence on climate, illustrating that some extreme events are becoming less likely due to climate change.","One of the most recent series of studies in this field (Peterson et al. 2012;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2013) attempts to answer this question for several extreme events that occurred in 2011 and 2012, with one of the studies being an attribution study of exceptionally warm Novembers in central England (Massey et al. 2012), which explicitly applies PEA.","['In recent years wet British summers have been reported frequently, with record-breaking rainfall in June in 2012 and a wet July following a wet spring, and the exceptionally rainy July in 2007, not record breaking in the monthly totals but with very intense shorter rain events within the month, which resulted in heavy summer floods in middle England and Wales.', 'Although large scale flooding held off in 2012, the extreme rain caused damage to the harvest and put strain on infrastructure systems.', 'However the heavy flooding in 2007, following very high daily and 5-day totals (with 3 top 12 5-day totals in July compared to the whole observed period, and the 5th highest total daily precipitation), was classified as a national disaster by the Environment Agency causing economic losses of approximately ��3 billion (Report Environment Agency UK, 2010).', 'There is no significant trend in July rainfall extremes,however, as extremes are by definition rare, a trend would only be detectable if the risk of extremes changed dramatically.', 'Trend analysis will thus not reveal subtle changes in extreme precipitation.', 'In times of anthropogenic climate change with increasing global mean temperatures the question arises if the observed extreme events were just bad luck or whether heavy rainfall in summer, especially in July, is something we have reasons to expect in the future and should begin adapting to in terms of infrastructure planning?', 'Even before a trend might be detectable, attribution analysis can reveal the influence of anthropogenic climate change on very rare events, and such is the aim of this paper.', 'July precipitation on a timescale relevant for flooding will be the focus of this study.', 'It is important to highlight here that precipitation in the relevant month, although important, is only one factor determining flood risk (Kay et al. 2011).', 'We attempt to answer the question of how the odds of extreme July precipitation relevant for flooding have changed, not the odds of floods occurring in July.', 'Increasingly, politicians, decision-makers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) want to know whether and to what extent global human-influenced climate change is affecting localised extreme weather events, highlighted by the fact that the Conference of the Party (COP) meeting in Doha in November 2012 established a work programme specifically on loss and damage due to climate change (UNFCCC report FCCC/SBI/2012/29 2012), further developed into the ""Warsaw mechanism"" at the COP in 2013.', 'Studies into the European heat wave of 2003(Stott et al. 2004, the England and Wales floods of 2000 (Pall et al. 2011), and the Russian heat wave of 2010 (Dole et al. 2011;Rahmstorf and Coumou 2011;Otto et al. 2012) have sought to determine to what extent the risks of these events occurring have changed because of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, many of them using the emerging method of probabilistic event attribution (PEA).', 'Under the assumption of an unchanging relationship between hazard and resulting damage, event probability can be seen as a proxy for risk (Pall et al. 2011).', 'One of the most recent series of studies in this field (Peterson et al. 2012;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2013) attempts to answer this question for several extreme events that occurred in 2011 and 2012, with one of the studies being an attribution study of exceptionally warm Novembers in central England (Massey et al. 2012), which explicitly applies PEA.', 'It finds a 40 times increase in the risk of such warm Novembers occurring, when comparing simulated temperatures of the 2000s with the 1960s.', 'Pall et al.

This effort involves the recovery of land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft, satellite, and other data; quality controlling and assimilating these data with a data assimilation system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis period 1957Ð96. This eliminates perceived climate jumps associated with changes in the data assimilation system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. The data assimilation and the model used are identical to the global system implemented operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210 km). The database has been enhanced with many sources of observations not available in real time for operations, provided by different countries and organizations. The system has been designed with advanced quality control and monitoring components, and can produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a Cray YMP/8 supercomputer. Different types of output archives are being created to satisfy different user needs, including a Òquick lookÓ CD-ROM (one per year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields available twice daily, as well as surface, top-of-the-atmosphere, and isentropic fields. Reanalysis information and selected output is also available on-line via the Internet (http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special CDROM, containing 13 years of selected observed, daily, monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, is included with this issue. Output variables are classified into four classes, depending on the degree to which they are influenced by the observations and/or the model. For example, ÒCÓ variables (such as precipitation and surface fluxes) are completely determined by the model during the data assimilation and should be used with caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these variables with observations and with several climatologies shows that they generally contain considerable useful information. Eight-day forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful for predictability studies and for monitoring the quality of the observing systems. The 40 years of reanalysis (1957Ð96) should be completed in early 1997. A continuation into the future through an identical Climate Data Assimilation System will allow researchers to reliably compare recent anomalies with those in earlier decades.

Using the standard thermodynamic models of sea ice, we find that the GCM-generated spread in longwave radiation produces equilibrium ice thicknesses that range from 1 to more than 10 meters. However, equilibrium ice thickness is an extremely sensitive function of the ice albedo, allowing errors in simulated cloud cover to be compensated by tuning of the ice albedo. This analysis suggests that the results of current GCMs cannot be relied upon at face value for credible predictions of future Arctic sea ice.","As current state of the art GCM sea ice projections are inconsistent with observations and with respect to other models (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2007), we apply an empirically-based method (Rayner et al. 2003) to provide sea ice fields for the natural model runs.","['We use a new method based on Pall et al.

This study explores whether early warning could have been provided through knowledge of natural and human-caused climate forcings. Model simulations and observational data are used to determine the impact of observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs), sea ice conditions and greenhouse gas concentrations. Analysis of forced model simulations indicates that neither human influences nor other slowly evolving ocean boundary conditions contributed substantially to the magnitude of this heat wave. They also provide evidence that such an intense event could be produced through natural variability alone. Analysis of observations indicate that this heat wave was mainly due to internal atmospheric dynamical processes that produced and maintained a strong and long-lived blocking event, and that similar atmospheric patterns have occurred with prior heat waves in this region. We conclude that the intense 2010 Russian heat wave was mainly due to natural internal atmospheric variability.

Therefore, we investigated two temperature indices and seven rainfall time series of northwestern Europe since the 17th century. Trends and multidecadal to interdecadal variability are similar in England and northern France for temperature, whereas a strong regional contrast is evident between the two regions for rainfall. Multidecadal and interdecadal variability displays several periods of enhanced amplitude for both temperature and rainfall that may be related to large-scale climate control. On these scales, temperatures in both England and France display phase opposition with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) before 1800, while they are in-phase afterward, as determined by wavelet coherence. On the other hand, the relationships between temperature and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are weak across multidecadal and interdecadal scales for the whole period under study. For rainfall, coherence with the AMO is observed for scales at around 30-60 years, whereas coherence with the NAO is detected on 50-80 year scales and interdecadal 16-23 year scales. However, relationships between rainfall variability and North Atlantic climate indices are highly contrasted depending on the region considered. Finally, the results of a mixed spectral/empirical orthogonal function analysis of mean sea level pressure on these co-oscillation time scales highlight not only NAO regimes but also other patterns, explaining a nonnegligible amount of variance during certain time periods","However, the mismatch could also indicate that the AMO is not the most important trigger (see also, e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2013) of the increased precipitation but that other climatological drivers such as, e.g., the location of the jet-stream, are driving the observed increased precipitation and MSLP anomalies.","['Our findings for July corroborate this argument but, since the results for the other two summer months are less clear, we infer that atmospheric dynamics also play an important role.', 'The fact that our analysis of the AMO does not match the observed findings of Sutton and Dong (2012) could be an indication that important processes in the model are not well represented, leading to an inaccurate precipitation signal in the model.', 'However, the mismatch could also indicate that the AMO is not the most important trigger (see also, e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2013) of the increased precipitation but that other climatological drivers such as, e.g., the location of the jet-stream, are driving the observed increased precipitation and MSLP anomalies.', 'The less clear, if any, signal for June and August 5-day precipitation indicates that more complex mechanisms than warmer SSTs alone are triggers of changes in summer precipitation in England and Wales.', 'Thus, a logical further study should investigate whether the change in return time of summer precipitation can be associated with a displacement of the jet stream.']",0,"['Our findings for July corroborate this argument but, since the results for the other two summer months are less clear, we infer that atmospheric dynamics also play an important role.', 'However, the mismatch could also indicate that the AMO is not the most important trigger (see also, e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2013) of the increased precipitation but that other climatological drivers such as, e.g., the location of the jet-stream, are driving the observed increased precipitation and MSLP anomalies.', 'The less clear, if any, signal for June and August 5-day precipitation indicates that more complex mechanisms than warmer SSTs alone are triggers of changes in summer precipitation in England and Wales.']"

CC270,146503003,"Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting, it also makes them more accessible",Nicolas Dumay,Memory Consolidation,"[""J T Wixted"", ""D J Cai""]","Several forms of learning, including classical conditioning of the eyeblink, depend upon the cerebellum. In examining mechanisms of eyeblink conditioning in rabbits, reversible inactivations of the control circuitry have begun to dissociate aspects of cerebellar cortical and nuclear function in memory consolidation. It was previously shown that post-training cerebellar cortical, but not nuclear, inactivations with the GABA(A) agonist muscimol prevented consolidation but these findings left open the question as to how final memory storage was partitioned across cortical and nuclear levels. Memory consolidation might be essentially cortical and directly disturbed by actions of the muscimol, or it might be nuclear, and sensitive to the raised excitability of the nuclear neurons following the loss of cortical inhibition. To resolve this question, we simultaneously inactivated cerebellar cortical lobule HVI and the anterior interpositus nucleus of rabbits during the post-training period, so protecting the nuclei from disinhibitory effects of cortical inactivation. Consolidation was impaired by these simultaneous inactivations. Because direct application of muscimol to the nuclei alone has no impact upon consolidation, we can conclude that post-training, consolidation processes and memory storage for eyeblink conditioning have critical cerebellar cortical components. The findings are consistent with a recent model that suggests the distribution of learning-related plasticity across cortical and nuclear levels is task-dependent. There can be transfer to nuclear or brainstem levels for control of high-frequency responses but learning with lower frequency response components, such as in eyeblink conditioning, remains mainly dependent upon cortical memory storage","Nine decades down the forgetting curves, the beneficial impact of sleep on memory is well established (see #AUTHOR_TAG, 2014, for a review).","['Nine decades down the forgetting curves, the beneficial impact of sleep on memory is well established (see #AUTHOR_TAG, 2014, for a review).', 'We know that the sooner the learner sleeps after encoding, the better the memory retention (Ekstrand, 1972;Gais, Lucas, & Born, 2006;Payne et al., 2012).', 'We also know that which sleep component is key to the consolidation process depends on the type of knowledge to be consolidated.', 'For instance, the conscious recollection of factual information or of our past experience (i.e., ""declarative"" memory) almost exclusively benefits from slow-wave (slow oscillations) sleep (Plihal & Born, 1997, 1999Yaroush, Sullivan, & Ekstrand, 1971).', 'By contrast, the positive effect of sleep on newly learnt perceptual or motor skills, i.e., procedural memory, shows a more complex picture, in which REM (rapid-eye movement) and non-REM sleep brain correlates have been implicated, sometimes in synergy (e.g., Gais, Plihal, Wagner, & Born, 2000;Gaskell et al., 2014;Karni, Tanne, Rubenstein, Askenasy, & Sagi, 1994;Rasch, Gais, & Born, 2009;Stickgold, James, & Hobson, 2000).']",0,"['Nine decades down the forgetting curves, the beneficial impact of sleep on memory is well established (see #AUTHOR_TAG, 2014, for a review).', 'We know that the sooner the learner sleeps after encoding, the better the memory retention (Ekstrand, 1972;Gais, Lucas, & Born, 2006;Payne et al., 2012).']"

Fernandez""]","The standard model of system-level consolidation posits that the hippocampus is part of a retrieval network for recent memories. According to this theory, the memories are gradually transferred to neocortical circuits with consolidation, where the connections within this circuit grow stronger and reorganized so that redundant and/or contextual details may be lost. Thus, remote memories are based on neocortical networks and can be retrieved independently of the hippocampus. To test this model, we measured regional brain activity and connectivity during retrieval with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects were trained on two sets of face-location association and were tested with two different delays, 15 min and 24 h including a whole night of sleep. We hypothesized that memory traces of the locations associated with specific faces will be linked through the hippocampus for the retrieval of recently learned association, but with consolidation, the activity and the functional connectivity between the neocortical areas will increase. We show that posterior hippocampal activity related to high-confidence retrieval decreased and neocortical activity increased with consolidation. Moreover, the connectivity between the hippocampus and the neocortical regions decreased and in turn, cortico-cortical connectivity between the representational areas increased. The results provide mechanistic support for a two-level process of the declarative memory system, involving initial representation of new associations in a network including the hippocampus and subsequent consolidation into a predominantly neocortical network.","Thus, on the basis of these non-linear changes, we know that for the sleep group something akin to systems consolidation had been triggered (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009).","[""Given this concern, I re-analyzed the data from two published studies (Dumay & Gaskell, 2007;Tamminen, Payne, Stickgold, Wamsley, & Gaskell, 2010;henceforth 'DG' and 'TPSWG'), that showed a positive effect of sleep on free recall under conditions in which performance was not constrained by the ceiling (or the floor)."", 'These studies used similar methodologies, which makes them easy to combine.', 'Participants were trained on made-up words either in the evening or in the morning in a phoneme detection task, and urged to learn.', 'Memory tests were then administered immediately and again after twelve hours, meaning, after nocturnal sleep or a day awake, respectively.', ""Crucially, because of the nature of the to-be-learnt stimuli, all competitors of existing words (e.g., 'caravoth' for 'caravan'), both studies could demonstrate overnight integration of the new items in lexico-semantic memory (cf."", 'Gaskell & Dumay, 2003;Leach & Samuel, 2007).', 'In both studies, emergence of the competitive influence from the novel words on perception of their base words was contingent upon the occurrence of sleep during the test-retest interval (see Dumay & Gaskell, 2005).', 'Thus, on the basis of these non-linear changes, we know that for the sleep group something akin to systems consolidation had been triggered (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009).', 'With this appropriate data set, item fate can show whether the net improvement in declarative knowledge observed after sleep was driven by protection against loss, by memory enhancement, or by both.', 'If protection against forgetting is the driving force, the sleep group should have a higher proportion than the wake group only on maintained items; in contrast, if active trace enhancement is operating, then the sleep group should instead differ from the wake group only on gained items.']",0,"[""Given this concern, I re-analyzed the data from two published studies (Dumay & Gaskell, 2007;Tamminen, Payne, Stickgold, Wamsley, & Gaskell, 2010;henceforth 'DG' and 'TPSWG'), that showed a positive effect of sleep on free recall under conditions in which performance was not constrained by the ceiling (or the floor)."", 'Thus, on the basis of these non-linear changes, we know that for the sleep group something akin to systems consolidation had been triggered (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009).', 'With this appropriate data set, item fate can show whether the net improvement in declarative knowledge observed after sleep was driven by protection against loss, by memory enhancement, or by both.', 'If protection against forgetting is the driving force, the sleep group should have a higher proportion than the wake group only on maintained items; in contrast, if active trace enhancement is operating, then the sleep group should instead differ from the wake group only on gained items.']"

Here, for the first time, we looked at the role of spindles in the integration of newly learned information with existing knowledge, contrasting this with explicit recall of the new information. Two groups of participants learned novel spoken words (e.g., cathedruke) that overlapped phonologically with familiar words (e.g., cathedral). The sleep group was exposed to the novel words in the evening, followed by an initial test, a polysomnographically monitored night of sleep, and a second test in the morning. The wake group was exposed and initially tested in the morning and spent a retention interval of similar duration awake. Finally, both groups were tested a week later at the same circadian time to control for possible circadian effects. In the sleep group, participants recalled more words and recognized them faster after sleep, whereas in the wake group such changes were not observed until the final test 1 week later. Following acquisition of the novel words, recognition of the familiar words was slowed in both groups, but only after the retention interval, indicating that the novel words had been integrated into the mental lexicon following consolidation. Importantly, spindle activity was associated with overnight lexical integration in the sleep group, but not with gains in recall rate or recognition speed of the novel words themselves.

This paper makes three points. First, long-established intellectual perspectives on innovation from neoclassical economics and organization theory are inadequate to explain the dynamics of actual innovative change in the IT domain. A broader view adopted from economic history and the new institutionalism in sociology provides a stronger base for understanding the role of institutions in IT innovation. Second, institutional intervention in IT innovation can be constructed at the intersection of the influence and regulatory powers of institutions and the ideologies of supply-push and demand-pull models of innovation. Examples of such analysis are provided.

Improved understanding of innovation diffusion across locations and through social connections can provide us with new insights into the spread of information, technological progress and economic development.

During its entire life cycle from 2002 to 2012, iWiW reached up to 300 million friendship ties of 3 million users. We find that the number of adopters as a function of town population follows a scaling law that reveals a strongly concentrated early adoption in large towns and a less concentrated late adoption. We also discover a strengthening distance decay of spread over the life-cycle indicating high fraction of distant diffusion in early stages but the dominance of local diffusion in late stages. The spreading process is modelled within the Bass diffusion framework that enables us to compare the differential equation version with an agent-based version of the model run on the empirical network. Although both models can capture the macro trend of adoption, they have limited capacity to describe the observed trends of urban scaling and distance decay. We find, however that incorporating adoption thresholds, defined by the fraction of social connections that adopt a technology before the individual adopts, improves the network model fit to the urban scaling of early adopters. Controlling for the threshold distribution enables us to eliminate the bias induced by local network structure on predicting local adoption peaks. Finally, we show that geographical features such as distance from the innovation origin and town size influence prediction of adoption peak at local scales.Comment: 21 pages, 11 figures, 4 table","Diffusion of a new idea, product or service is defined as the spread of its use in a population of potential adopters (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1995;King et al., 1994).","['Diffusion of a new idea, product or service is defined as the spread of its use in a population of potential adopters (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1995;King et al., 1994).', 'The process of diffusion has been linked to characteristics of the innovation itself, the social system (community of potential adopters), channels of communication, and time (Rogers, 1995).', 'Given the lack of a rigorous theory that acknowledges the embeddedness of e-government diffusion processes by municipalities in the larger context of governance (including central-local relationships and the activities of outreach programs), we scanned and searched related concepts in the organizational sociology and institutional theory disciplines -two related literature streams that explicitly address how organizations absorb prevailing ideas from their environments into their operations and structures.', 'However, this literature tends to be relatively abstract, and does not address the diffusion of personalized e-government in the specific context of municipalities.', 'Advancements in the discipline of organizational sociology in recent decades (Di-Maggio and Powell, 1983;Tolbert and Zucker, 1996) have highlighted the significance of the professional and/or legal rules, cognitive structures, norms and the prevailing values in which innovation takes place.', ""Institutionalism emphasizes the persuasive control over the practices, beliefs and belief systems of individuals or organizations through an institution's sway (Kimberley, 1979, in King et al., 1994."", ""Persuasion can be achieved not only through directives, but also through more gentle but nevertheless potentially convincing means such as deploying specific knowledge, subsidizing activities deemed 'appropriate' by national government, standard-setting, raising awareness and generally promoting specific technologies (King et al., 1994)."", ""Moreover, Venkatraman et al.

The question of exploration is dominated by the literature on ambidexterity but this research actually says little about concretely managing exploratory innovation itself, although this appears to be a central concern of most industrial firms today. Based on a material (twenty presentations made in a research seminar the authors have organized in the last two years) and a critical review of the literature, this paper provides new theoretical and managerial insights on the management of exploratory innovation. We first identify three complementary perspectives: 1. Managing knowledge for exploration, 2. Organizing for exploration, and 3. Creating new value spaces. Secondly, we recommend focusing the management of exploratory innovation on the following two processes: identifying an exploratory field, creating new opportunities via experimentation.Exploration, management of innovation, knowledge, value spaces","Respondents from the municipalities reported that perceptions of persuasive pressure were followed by organizational searching and scanning activities, through which municipalities attempted to seek, identify and choose relevant knowledge, experiences and courses of action (see also Levinthal and March, 1982;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009).","['Respondents from the municipalities reported that perceptions of persuasive pressure were followed by organizational searching and scanning activities, through which municipalities attempted to seek, identify and choose relevant knowledge, experiences and courses of action (see also Levinthal and March, 1982;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009).', 'One respondent clearly illustrated how municipalities react to pressure:']",0,"['Respondents from the municipalities reported that perceptions of persuasive pressure were followed by organizational searching and scanning activities, through which municipalities attempted to seek, identify and choose relevant knowledge, experiences and courses of action (see also Levinthal and March, 1982;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009).']"

It has changed and influenced how structures are organized, how targets are set, how budgets are allocated and how the daily work of local agencies and professions are performed. The main reason for the interest in the concept of Ôjoined-upÕ government has been the recognition that some problems of the government do not fit into the neat departmental boundaries of good government. However Ôjoined-upÕ government has brought some changes; it is still in its infancy. Most departments of the government are still arranged in a vertical manner and this has been the case for almost fifty years and most of the joining-up of government agencies is the result of existing coordination between these departments rather than changes in the radical structure. This chapter discusses the background of British Ôjoined-upÕ government. It also discusses reforms the UK government has undertaken since 1997 to achieve the goal of a new government through integration and coordination. The chapter concludes with the possible direction of the future reforms on Ôjoined-upÕ government.","In many western countries, it is especially local governments that are developing one-stop shops that serve as a point-of-entry to the whole range of government (Ling, 2002;Ho, 2002;Beynon-Davies and Martin, 2004;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2005) in such a way that the relationship between public sector organisations and citizens is re-engineered (Beynon- Davies and Martin, 2004).","['The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is central in many national policies as the means to actually realise government modernisation and transformation agendas.', 'In many western countries, it is especially local governments that are developing one-stop shops that serve as a point-of-entry to the whole range of government (Ling, 2002;Ho, 2002;Beynon-Davies and Martin, 2004;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2005) in such a way that the relationship between public sector organisations and citizens is re-engineered (Beynon- Davies and Martin, 2004).', 'This redesign phenomenon has been termed electronic government (Bekkers and Homburg, 2005).']",4,"['The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is central in many national policies as the means to actually realise government modernisation and transformation agendas.', 'In many western countries, it is especially local governments that are developing one-stop shops that serve as a point-of-entry to the whole range of government (Ling, 2002;Ho, 2002;Beynon-Davies and Martin, 2004;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2005) in such a way that the relationship between public sector organisations and citizens is re-engineered (Beynon- Davies and Martin, 2004).', 'This redesign phenomenon has been termed electronic government (Bekkers and Homburg, 2005).']"

The article first develops a theoretical framework by extending the basic communication model of diffusion to include state government's role in state government-sponsored innovation and its diffusion. This model also incorporates organizational and innovation factors. Next an empirical test of the extended communication model is conducted using data on innovations sponsored by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). The results suggest that the degree of state government involvement in innovation development is positively associated with diffusion. The results also indicate that state government's diffusion-facilitating efforts such as providing information about innovations, financial support during development, and procedural facilitation of development are positively related to industry's adoption decision for new innovation.","Moreover, Venkatraman et al.

Kimberly""]","Kimberly presents a case study of the birth and early development of an innovative medical school. When the school opened in 1971, the existing 86 medical schools all offered similar programs: two years of basic science training in lecture halls and laboratories, followed by two years of direct contact with patients in clinical settings. In the new school, students were taught didactically only during the first year. During the second year, each student was assigned to a community physician who acted as an advisor and who discussed with students those patients afflicted with the diseases the student was currently studying. Available evidence indicated that the school's innovative curriculum was favorably received by the students and that they performed as well as their peers on standardized year-end exams. The author found the case of this medical school to be of particular interest from an organizational viewpoint in that: (1) the early development of the school was shaped by the first dean's entrepreneurial activity, ambitions, visions, strengths, and weaknesses; (2) the uncertainty resulting from the school's novelty forced individuals to assume new roles and face unclear performance criteria; and (3) the transition of an innovative school to an institutionalized one was problematic because it modified the decision-making process. The author suggests that those things which lead to an organization's success during its early years are not the same as those that lead to longer-run success. He says that a new organization creates new norms, values, and procedures whereas the elements of an existing organization interact within an established culture. He concludes that organizational birth is a phenomenon about which relatively little is known, but which may be an important constraint on later development. A comparative analysis of the birth, life, and death of organization is advocated.","Institutionalism emphasizes the persuasive control over the practices, beliefs and belief systems of individuals or organizations through an institution's sway (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1979, in King et al., 1994.","['Diffusion of a new idea, product or service is defined as the spread of its use in a population of potential adopters (Rogers, 1995;King et al., 1994).', 'The process of diffusion has been linked to characteristics of the innovation itself, the social system (community of potential adopters), channels of communication, and time (Rogers, 1995).', 'Given the lack of a rigorous theory that acknowledges the embeddedness of e-government diffusion processes by municipalities in the larger context of governance (including central-local relationships and the activities of outreach programs), we scanned and searched related concepts in the organizational sociology and institutional theory disciplines -two related literature streams that explicitly address how organizations absorb prevailing ideas from their environments into their operations and structures.', 'However, this literature tends to be relatively abstract, and does not address the diffusion of personalized e-government in the specific context of municipalities.', 'Advancements in the discipline of organizational sociology in recent decades (Di-Maggio and Powell, 1983;Tolbert and Zucker, 1996) have highlighted the significance of the professional and/or legal rules, cognitive structures, norms and the prevailing values in which innovation takes place.', ""Institutionalism emphasizes the persuasive control over the practices, beliefs and belief systems of individuals or organizations through an institution's sway (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1979, in King et al., 1994."", ""Persuasion can be achieved not only through directives, but also through more gentle but nevertheless potentially convincing means such as deploying specific knowledge, subsidizing activities deemed 'appropriate' by national government, standard-setting, raising awareness and generally promoting specific technologies (King et al., 1994)."", ""Moreover, Venkatraman et al.

Information communication technologies (ICTs) apparently allow public service to become cheaper, faster and more democratic. E-government has become another buzzword, the shining future of the public realm. Critics claim, however, that ICTsÕ potential for democratic renewal is hampered by ancient assumptions of how governments should function. But which viewpoint is nearer the truth? In this original and insightful volume, Vincent Homburg demonstrates how the use, form and impact of ICTs are, in fact, entwined within the socio-political, economic and institutional aspects already established by government and public administration. Evangelical or fatalistic perspectives are discredited to show the different realities in which ICTs play a role in our daily lives. Using case studies and vignettes from throughout Europe and the US, the book analyzes what these new technologies actually do, and how they are screened through varying layers of bureaucracy and convention. This is a timely addition to our understanding of what is meant by e-government. It gets behind the political rhetoric. Understanding E-Government: Information Systems in Public Administration will be key reading for all students of public administration, political science, organization theory and information systems.","These include socio-political problems of information sharing across traditional organisational boundaries (Mulgan, 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2008), the existence of legacy systems (Pieterson et al., 2007) and concerns related to privacy issues (Lips et al., 2004).","['Implementing personalised electronic government services is far from trivial and the literature reports many obstacles.', 'These include socio-political problems of information sharing across traditional organisational boundaries (Mulgan, 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2008), the existence of legacy systems (Pieterson et al., 2007) and concerns related to privacy issues (Lips et al., 2004).']",0,"['Implementing personalised electronic government services is far from trivial and the literature reports many obstacles.', 'These include socio-political problems of information sharing across traditional organisational boundaries (Mulgan, 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2008), the existence of legacy systems (Pieterson et al., 2007) and concerns related to privacy issues (Lips et al., 2004).']"

Tolbert"", ""Lynne G. Zucker""]","[Excerpt] Our primary aims in this effort are twofold: to clarify the independent theoretical contributions of institutional theory to analyses of organizations, and to develop this theoretical perspective further in order to enhance its use in empirical research. There is also a more general, more ambitious objective here, and that is to build a bridge between two distinct models of social actor that underlie most organizational analyses, which we refer to as a rational actor model and an institutional model. The former is premised on the assumption that individuals are constantly engaged in calculations of the costs and benefits of different action choices, and that behavior reflects such utility-maximizing calculations. In the latter model, by contrast, \u27oversocialized\u27 individuals are assumed to accept and follow social norms unquestioningly, without any real reflection or behavioral resistance based on their own particular, personal interests. We suggest that these two general models should be treated not as oppositional but rather as representing two ends of a continuum of decision-making processes and behaviors. Thus, a key problem for theory and research is to specify the conditions under which behavior is more likely to resemble one end of this continuum or the other. In short, what is needed are theories of when rationality is likely to be more or less bounded.

The purpose of this exploratory study is to understand knowledge brokering from the perspective of IT professionals as they reflect upon their work practice.

A qualitative analysis of interviews conducted with 23 IT professionals and business users in a large manufacturing and distribution company is summarized in a conceptual framework showing the conditions, practices, and consequences of knowledge brokering by IT professionals.  The framework suggests that brokering practices are conditioned by structural conditions, including decentralization and a federated IT management organization, and by technical conditions, specifically shared IT systems that serve as boundary objects.  Brokering practices include gaining permission to cross organizational boundaries, surfacing and challenging assumptions made by IT users, translation and interpretation, and relinquishing ownership of knowledge.

For this purpose, we generated a comprehensive sample of outsourcing contracts in the US using an electronic bibliometric search process. Using diffusion modeling, our empirical analysis shows that the adoption of IT outsourcing is motivated more by internal influence (or imitative behavior) than by external influence amongst the user organizations. Subsequently, we considered the widely publicized Eastman Kodak's outsourcing decision as a critical event to assess whether this internal influence is more pronounced in the post-Kodak regime than in the pre- Kodak regime. Our results show that internal influence is dominant in the post-Kodak regime but not in the pre-Kodak regime.

Wong"", ""T.C. Edwin Cheng""]","The adoption of information technology (IT) along a supply chain has increasingly become a necessity for enhancing supply chain performance. Organizations in a supply chain often adopt IT due to the institutional pressure exerted by their supply chain partners. The implications of the different types of institutional isomorphism, namely coercion, mimesis, and norms, are explored from both the perspectives of firms that have taken the initiatives to adopt IT and those that have followed their supply chain partners to adopt IT. The possible impact of the different types of institutional isomorphism discussed here can help managers to better understand the institutional pressure they are putting on and/or of adapting to their supply chain partners, in particular, the possible problems and the injunctions/compliances they may face in the course of adopting IT for the management of their supply chains.

Three diffusion models - the external, internal and mixed influence models - are employed to reveal whether the diffusion of the TEFS in Taiwan is affected by government promotion efforts, interactions among acquaintances or a combination of both. Findings indicate that the influence of acquaintances is the major predictor of Taiwan's TEFS diffusion and the mixed influence model is the best fit.

CC306,18509190,Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities: evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies,Vincent Homburg,Learning to Change: An Information Perspective on Learning in the Organization,"[""Stuart Macdonald""]","Change in the organization is usually analysed in the context of the organization in which the change is taking place. This is quite understandable and yields recognition of those internal factors most instrumental in the change process. From this organizational perspective, external factors seem to play a marginal role in change, at most a catalytic role. Change is always relative, but not simply to what the organization has done before. Organizational change should also be relative to what is going on outside the organization. What appears to be major progress from an organizational perspective may look like stagnation in a wider context. This paper suggests that notions of the ""learning organization"" have often emphasied internal aspects of the change process and neglected the external. In particular, they seem to have paid little attention to the essential contribution of external information to internal change. Information is so fundamental to the learning required for deliberate change that it is not unreasonable to see change as an information process. This view affords an information perspective of change in the organization, and a revealing contrast to the usual organizational perspective. Change in the organization is seen as a process in which the finding and acquisition of external information are critical. So, too, is mixing these external bits of information with those already in use within the organization. The result is not just another model of what is already understood about change in the organization. It has profound implications for those who seek to understand and manage the process of change. The information perspective indicates that organizational change is largely dependent on the information activities of individual employees acting on their own account as much as that of the organization. These activities may be---and sometimes must be---beyond the control of the organization. Thus, those who would manage change face the challenge of managing without control. The information perspective suggests that the concentration on structure and control inherent in notions of the learning organization may be mimical to the real learning required for organizational change.","Framing: translating pressure into local priorities and opportunities According to Sahlin and Wedlin (2008; see also Silva and Hirscheim, 2007), and in line with the Scandinavian Institutionalism mentioned in the discussion on theoretical antecedents of diffusion, knowledge and ideas cannot simply be transfused from one organisation to the other: rather, ideas, concepts and knowledge has to be repackaged and re-embedded (Isabella, 1990;#AUTHOR_TAG, 1995;Sahlin and Wedlin, 2008).","['Framing: translating pressure into local priorities and opportunities According to Sahlin and Wedlin (2008; see also Silva and Hirscheim, 2007), and in line with the Scandinavian Institutionalism mentioned in the discussion on theoretical antecedents of diffusion, knowledge and ideas cannot simply be transfused from one organisation to the other: rather, ideas, concepts and knowledge has to be repackaged and re-embedded (Isabella, 1990;#AUTHOR_TAG, 1995;Sahlin and Wedlin, 2008).', ""In our field study, respondents explained that comparable ideas and 'chunks' of knowledge on personalisation were framed completely differently in various adopting organisations."", 'Personalisation was sometimes framed in terms of:']",0,"['Framing: translating pressure into local priorities and opportunities According to Sahlin and Wedlin (2008; see also Silva and Hirscheim, 2007), and in line with the Scandinavian Institutionalism mentioned in the discussion on theoretical antecedents of diffusion, knowledge and ideas cannot simply be transfused from one organisation to the other: rather, ideas, concepts and knowledge has to be repackaged and re-embedded (Isabella, 1990;#AUTHOR_TAG, 1995;Sahlin and Wedlin, 2008).', ""In our field study, respondents explained that comparable ideas and 'chunks' of knowledge on personalisation were framed completely differently in various adopting organisations."", 'Personalisation was sometimes framed in terms of:']"

There is however one important difference: the MR-systems are widely used.

Jane M. Howell and Christine M. Shea address this knowledge gap by using measures of individual differences, environmental scanning, innovation framing and champion behavior to predict the performance of 47 product innovation projects. Champion behavior was defined as expressing confidence in the innovation, involving and motivating others to support the innovation, and persisting under adversity. Interviews with 47 champions were conducted to collect information about the innovation projects and the champions' tendency to frame the innovation as an opportunity or threat. Survey data were obtained from three sources: 47 champions provided information on their personal characteristics (locus of control and breadth of interest) and activities (environmental scanning), 47 division managers subjectively assessed project performance at two points in time, and 237 innovation team members rated the frequency of champion behavior. The results revealed that an internal locus of control orientation was positively related to framing the innovation as an opportunity, and breadth of interest was positively related to environmental scanning. Environmental scanning of documents and framing the innovation as a threat was negatively related to champion behavior, while environmental scanning through people was positively related to champion behavior. Champion behavior positively predicted project performance over a one-year interval. Overall, the findings suggest that in scanning the environment for new ideas, the most effective source of information is the champion's personal network of people inside and outside the organization. Also, the simple labeling of an idea as a threat appears to diminish a champion's perceived influence and erode credibility in promoting an innovation. From the perspective of division managers, champions make a positive contribution to project performance over time, reinforcing the crucial role that champions play in new product development process.","It is especially through these kinds of integration mechanisms that ideas and knowledge are actually transfused, translated and framed rather than merely being imitated (#AUTHOR_TAG and Shea, 2001; see also Bressant and Rush, 1995;Rice and Rogers, 1980;Sahlin and Wedlin, 2008;Silva and Hirscheim, 2007).","['It is especially through these kinds of integration mechanisms that ideas and knowledge are actually transfused, translated and framed rather than merely being imitated (#AUTHOR_TAG and Shea, 2001; see also Bressant and Rush, 1995;Rice and Rogers, 1980;Sahlin and Wedlin, 2008;Silva and Hirscheim, 2007).', 'These observations lead us to identify conjectures 5A and 5B.']",1,"['It is especially through these kinds of integration mechanisms that ideas and knowledge are actually transfused, translated and framed rather than merely being imitated (#AUTHOR_TAG and Shea, 2001; see also Bressant and Rush, 1995;Rice and Rogers, 1980;Sahlin and Wedlin, 2008;Silva and Hirscheim, 2007).']"

This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of government-supported economic analysis of regulation. We find that there is growing interest in the use of economic tools, such as benefit-cost analysis; however, the quality of analysis in the U.S. and European Union frequently fails to meet widely accepted guidelines. Furthermore, the relationship between analysis and policy decisions is tenuous. To address this situation, we recommend pursuing an agenda in which economics plays a more central role in regulatory decision making. In addition, we suggest that prediction markets could help improve regulatory policy and improve measurement of the impact of regulation.","Perhaps unsurprisingly, the reality of carrying out benefit-cost analysis of federal regulations falls short of best practice, and it does not appear to be having a significant impact on many regulatory decisions, except higher-profile cases (#AUTHOR_TAG and Tetlock 2008).","['While the United States does not lead the world in making climate-change mitigation policies, it has been a pioneer in the use of benefit-cost analysis to inform the making of federal regulations more generally.', 'The intention is that regulations are adopted only if they provide benefits in excess of their costs.', 'Perhaps unsurprisingly, the reality of carrying out benefit-cost analysis of federal regulations falls short of best practice, and it does not appear to be having a significant impact on many regulatory decisions, except higher-profile cases (#AUTHOR_TAG and Tetlock 2008).', 'Nevertheless, the introduction of an SCC is a potentially significant step in the development of US climatemitigation policy, especially in the continuing absence of dedicated, overarching mitigation policy instruments whose costs to individuals and firms could more directly enter benefit-cost calculations in other policy areas.']",0,"['Perhaps unsurprisingly, the reality of carrying out benefit-cost analysis of federal regulations falls short of best practice, and it does not appear to be having a significant impact on many regulatory decisions, except higher-profile cases (#AUTHOR_TAG and Tetlock 2008).']"

This task will be undertaken in detail in the next chapter, which deals with entrepreneurship. At this point we may anticipate to the extent of making two observations: first, the typical uninsurable (because unmeasurable and this because unclassifiable) business risk relates to the exercise of judgment in the making of decisions by the business man; second, although such estimates do tend to fall into groups within which fluctuations cancel out and hence to approach constancy and measurability, this happens only after the fact and, especially in view of the brevity of a man's active life, can only to a limited extent be made the basis of prediction. Furthermore, the classification or grouping can only to a limited extent be carried out by any agency outside the person himself who makes the decisions because of the peculiarly obstinate connection of a moral hazard with this sort of risks.

By contrast, several axiomatic frameworks have recently been proposed that account for ambiguous beliefs.

Climate change is a serious and urgent issue. The Earth has already warmed by 0.7degC since around 1900 and is committed to further warming over coming decades simply due to past emissions. On current trends, average global temperatures could rise by 2-3degC within the next fifty years or so, with several degrees more in the pipeline by the end of the century if emissions continue to grow. This chapter examines how the physical changes in climate . . . affect the essential components of lives and livelihoods of people around the world -- water supply, food production, human health, availability of land, and ecosystems. It looks in particular at how these impacts intensify with increasing amounts of warming. The latest science suggests that the Earth's average temperature will rise by even more than 5 or 6degC if feedbacks amplify the warming effect of greenhouse gases through the release of carbon dioxide from soils or methane from permafrost. . . . Throughout the chapter, changes in global mean temperature are expressed relative to pre-industrial levels (1750-1850). The chapter builds up a comprehensive picture of impacts by incorporating two effects that are not usually included in existing studies (extreme events and threshold effects at higher temperatures). In general, impact studies have focused predominantly on changes in average conditions and rarely examine the consequences of increased variability and more extreme weather. In addition, almost all impact studies have only considered global temperature rises up to 4 or 5degC and therefore do not take account of threshold effects that could be triggered by temperatures higher than 5 or 6degC","Doing so permits greater confidence that the target will be met, while the existence of a long-run quantity target in the first place can be supported by reasoning about the efficiency of price and quantity instruments under uncertainty (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007).","['Since recent research has stretched out the upper tail of SCC estimates, this ratio could now be even greater. 6', 'Another observation is that all models, whether of the SCC or MAC or both, are imperfect, and few would disagree with the need to look to other forms of evidence in setting the stringency of climate policies.', 'Given these two observations, it is possible to recommend an approach whereby a quantitative long-run emissions target is set, and insofar as prices are used to meet that target, they are based on the MAC, rather than the SCC (although clearly to avoid circularity the SCC needs to inform target setting).', 'Doing so permits greater confidence that the target will be met, while the existence of a long-run quantity target in the first place can be supported by reasoning about the efficiency of price and quantity instruments under uncertainty (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007).', 'To expand, the comparative efficiency of price and quantity instruments under uncertainty is known to depend in a general setting on the relative slopes of the marginal cost and benefit functions (Weitzman 1974).', 'In the context of carbon abatement, this insight has generally been used to recommend price instruments in the short run, since the short-run marginal benefit function for a long-lived stock pollutant (e.g.', 'CO2) is flat, compared with a short-run marginal cost function that is steep (Pizer 1999).', 'However, in the long run, with the existence of possibly catastrophic climate change, the opposite seems to hold: marginal benefits are steeply increasing upon reaching some stock of CO2, while marginal costs are fairly flat.']",5,"['Since recent research has stretched out the upper tail of SCC estimates, this ratio could now be even greater. 6', 'Another observation is that all models, whether of the SCC or MAC or both, are imperfect, and few would disagree with the need to look to other forms of evidence in setting the stringency of climate policies.', 'Given these two observations, it is possible to recommend an approach whereby a quantitative long-run emissions target is set, and insofar as prices are used to meet that target, they are based on the MAC, rather than the SCC (although clearly to avoid circularity the SCC needs to inform target setting).', 'Doing so permits greater confidence that the target will be met, while the existence of a long-run quantity target in the first place can be supported by reasoning about the efficiency of price and quantity instruments under uncertainty (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007).', 'To expand, the comparative efficiency of price and quantity instruments under uncertainty is known to depend in a general setting on the relative slopes of the marginal cost and benefit functions (Weitzman 1974).', 'In the context of carbon abatement, this insight has generally been used to recommend price instruments in the short run, since the short-run marginal benefit function for a long-lived stock pollutant (e.g.', 'CO2) is flat, compared with a short-run marginal cost function that is steep (Pizer 1999).', 'However, in the long run, with the existence of possibly catastrophic climate change, the opposite seems to hold: marginal benefits are steeply increasing upon reaching some stock of CO2, while marginal costs are fairly flat.']"

Given that they are nonlinear and not perfect, what can we expect to learn from them about the earth's climate? How can we determine which aspects of their output might be useful and which are noise? And how should we distribute resources between making them Òbetter,Ó estimating variables of true social and economic interest, and quantifying how good they are at the moment? Just as ÒchaosÓ prevents accurate weather forecasts, so model error precludes accurate forecasts of the distributions that define climate, yielding uncertainty of the second kind. Can we estimate the uncertainty in our uncertainty estimates? These questions are discussed. Ultimately, all uncertainty is quantified within a given modeling paradigm; our forecasts need never reflect the uncertainty in a physical system.","Having said that, even if we only had one model at our disposal, it would be natural to question whether the probabilities we have specified resolve all uncertainty, and the answer in the case of physical forecasts of future climate (and by implication economic forecasts) would have to be in the negative (#AUTHOR_TAG 2002).","['Having said that, even if we only had one model at our disposal, it would be natural to question whether the probabilities we have specified resolve all uncertainty, and the answer in the case of physical forecasts of future climate (and by implication economic forecasts) would have to be in the negative (#AUTHOR_TAG 2002).', 'Ultimately, then, we cannot be sure how well our Monte Carlo simulations and our inter-model comparisons represent uncertainty in the real world.']",0,"['Having said that, even if we only had one model at our disposal, it would be natural to question whether the probabilities we have specified resolve all uncertainty, and the answer in the case of physical forecasts of future climate (and by implication economic forecasts) would have to be in the negative (#AUTHOR_TAG 2002).']"

Here we argue that heat stress imposes a robust upper limit to such adaptation. Peak heat stress, quantified by the wet-bulb temperature TW, is surprisingly similar across diverse climates today. TW never exceeds 31 degC. Any exceedence of 35 degC for extended periods should induce hyperthermia in humans and other mammals, as dissipation of metabolic heat becomes impossible. While this never happens now, it would begin to occur with global-mean warming of about 7 degC, calling the habitability of some regions into question. With 11-12 degC warming, such regions would spread to encompass the majority of the human population as currently distributed. Eventual warmings of 12 degC are possible from fossil fuel burning. One implication is that recent estimates of the costs of unmitigated climate change are too low unless the range of possible warming can somehow be narrowed.

Humanity is risking the health of the natural environment through a myriad of interventions, including the atmospheric emission of trace gases such as carbon dioxide, the use of ozone-depleting chemicals, the engineering of massive land-use changes, and the destruction of the habitats of many species.

What is the economic cost of reducing GHG emissions? The economic aspect of the policy debate intensified with the publication in the UK of the Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change (Stern, 2006). Stern concluded that, if no mitigative action is taken, ""the overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) each year, now and forever."" This conclusion has been criticized by many economists, particularly in the United States, where Professor William Nordhaus of Yale, the leading American expert on climate economics, concludes that the economically optimal policy involves only a modest rate of emission reduction in the near term, followed by larger reductions later (Nordhaus 2008). The disagreement between Stern and Nordhaus has aroused considerable interest. Much of the existing discussion focuses on the difference in the discount rate - Stern uses a consumption rate of discount average 1.4% per annum, while Nordhaus uses one averaging 4%. 1 However, I believe that another important factor is the difference in the raw assessment of undiscounted damages from climate change.

Comparison of the two patterns suggests that the conventional architecture prevails in eukaryotic nuclei because it results in more flexible chromosome arrangements, facilitating positional regulation of nuclear functions.","When light is dimmed, the chromatin changes transcription and reorganises in such a way that its material behaves as a lens, focusing photons on receptors located behind the neurons (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009)!","['1.', 'The first counterargument explores the concept of Operating System (OS) (von Neumann 1958).', 'Because the machine is separated from the program, a subset of the program must be devoted to the interaction with the machine and its ""users"" (in the most general sense) (Danchin 2009a).', 'If a particular routine is meant to reproduce the machine, then a subset of the program must be somehow linked to the architecture of the machine.', 'Analysis of the genes giving bacteria their shape showed that there is indeed an unexpected coincidence between gene clustering in genomes and shape of bacteria (Tamames et al. 2001).', 'In multicellular organisms, the distribution of control genes, the homeogenes, parallels the body plan: changing the order of some homeogenes in the chromosomes changed the shape of the organism, putting organs in the place of others (Gaunt 1991).', 'Rather than an objection, the existence of a correlation between the organisation of the program and the architecture of the organism fits a prediction of the model.', '2.

However, computers do not make computers. For cells to make cells requires a specific organization of the genetic program, which we investigate using available knowledge. Microbial genomes are organized into a paleome (the name emphasizes the role of the corresponding functions from the time of the origin of life), comprising a constructor and a replicator, and a cenome (emphasizing community-relevant genes), made up of genes that permit life in a particular context. The cell duplication process supposes rejuvenation of the machine and replication of the program. The paleome also possesses genes that enable information to accumulate in a ratchet-like process down the generations.

In turn, these insights have led to applications over a broad range of subjects, as well as to new interpretations of complex behavior. Inevitably, it seems, there has been a concomitant rush to re-interpret various well-understood aspects of thermodynamic behavior in manybody systems by means of these mechanisms. It is perhaps useful, therefore, to examine these notions critically, and in doing so we are able to illuminate somewhat the origins of, and motivations for, various dubious descriptions of these systems. Among other things, one notices in such discussions an unfortunate focus on Òrandomness,Ó rather than on the actual role of probabilities in describing the phenomena. Although valuable insights into some areas of complex behavior have arisen from studies of so-called Òdeterministic chaos,Ó we can detect no influence they may have on the predictions of statistical mechanics, and thus conclude that they are of little relevance to the thermodynamic behavior of large systems.","Yet, it was obvious that these universal categories do not account for many phenomena: no one has been able, for example, to derive the crystal lattice of a mineral as simple as sodium chloride from the equations of microscopic physics (#AUTHOR_TAG 1992).","['From the early times of philosophy, life was identified as a phenomenon connected to recognisable autonomous but not independent categories.', 'To account for all phenomena, Aristotle recognised ten categories: _�__�_�_�_�, ___�_�_�_�______, ___�___�______, ___�_�__ ____, ___�_�_�___�__, __�______, ___�___�__, ___�_�___�__, ___�_�_____�____, ___�___�_�__.', 'An essential step in understanding reality required construction of some entanglement of these categories, a process which progressively reduced them to four: matter, space, time, and subsequently energy.', 'A remarkable achievement was reached when Einstein combined them together in a surprisingly concise equation, E = mc 2 .', 'Yet, it was obvious that these universal categories do not account for many phenomena: no one has been able, for example, to derive the crystal lattice of a mineral as simple as sodium chloride from the equations of microscopic physics (#AUTHOR_TAG 1992).', 'Imagine the challenge for synthetic biology!']",1,"['Yet, it was obvious that these universal categories do not account for many phenomena: no one has been able, for example, to derive the crystal lattice of a mineral as simple as sodium chloride from the equations of microscopic physics (#AUTHOR_TAG 1992).']"

It is suggested that the achievements of Savage-Rumbaugh's non-human subjects suggest that language ability need not be explained by reference to specialised brain capacities. The contribution made by Clark's work is to show the range of ways in which cognition exploits bodily and environmental resources.

One of the most ambitious research line concerns the so-called semi-synthetic minimal cells, which are liposome-based system capable of synthesizing the lipids within the liposome surface. This goal can be reached by reconstituting membrane proteins within liposomes and allow them to synthesize lipids. This approach, that can be defined as biochemical, was already reported by us (Schmidli et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 8127-8130, 1991). In more advanced models, however, a full reconstruction of the biochemical pathway requires (1) the synthesis of functional membrane enzymes inside liposomes, and (2) the local synthesis of lipids as catalyzed by the in situ synthesized enzymes. Here we show the synthesis and the activity--inside liposomes--of two membrane proteins involved in phospholipids biosynthesis pathway. The proteins, sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT), have been synthesized by using a totally reconstructed cell-free system (PURE system) encapsulated in liposomes. The activities of internally synthesized GPAT and LPAAT were confirmed by detecting the produced lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid, respectively. Through this procedure, we have implemented the first phase of a design aimed at synthesizing phospholipid membrane from liposome within from within - which corresponds to the autopoietic growth mechanism.","This dichotomy is visible in present synthetic biology, with a fairly clear separation between those who study the chassis (and are often also interested in the origin of life) (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009;Shenhav and Lancet 2004) and those who think that life is essentially due to the genetic program, organising their activity around construction of program biobricks, or even as complete genomes (Gibson et al. 2008).","['In summary, two types of information (coupling of a particular form-not simply shape-with matter, energy, space and time), information of the chassis (casing + metabolism) and information of the program are associated together in a cell (Tanaka 1984).', 'A synthetic cell needs the association of a chassis developing metabolism (not a simple 3D casing) and a program similar to that found in computers.', ""The conclusions of Dyson's argument on the double origin of life, with reproducing metabolism predating replication are therefore a pre-requisite for synthesis of life (Dyson 1985)."", 'This dichotomy is visible in present synthetic biology, with a fairly clear separation between those who study the chassis (and are often also interested in the origin of life) (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009;Shenhav and Lancet 2004) and those who think that life is essentially due to the genetic program, organising their activity around construction of program biobricks, or even as complete genomes (Gibson et al. 2008).']",1,"['This dichotomy is visible in present synthetic biology, with a fairly clear separation between those who study the chassis (and are often also interested in the origin of life) (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2009;Shenhav and Lancet 2004) and those who think that life is essentially due to the genetic program, organising their activity around construction of program biobricks, or even as complete genomes (Gibson et al. 2008).']"

The performance of a series of codes is evaluated by, as the block lengths approach infinity, whether their error probabilities decay to zero, whether their rates converge to capacity, and whether their growth in complexities stays under control. Over any discrete memoryless channel, I build codes such that: (1) their error probabilities and rates scale like random codes; and (2) their en/decoding complexities scale like polar codes. Quantitatively, for any constants $p,r>0$ s.t. $p+2r0$ s.t. $2r<1$, I construct a series of codes with block length $N$ approaching infinity, error probability $\exp(-(\log N)^t)$, rate $N^{-r}$ less than the capacity, and en/decoding complexity $O(N\log(\log N))$ per block. The two aforementioned results are built upon two pillars: a versatile framework that generates codes on the basis of channel polarization, and a calculus-probability machinery that evaluates the performances of codes. The framework that generates codes and the machinery that evaluates codes can be extended to many other scenarios in network information theory. To name a few: lossless compression, lossy compression, Slepian-Wolf, Wyner-Ziv, multiple access channel, wiretap channel, and broadcast channel. In each scenario, the adapted notions of error probability and rate approach their limits at the same paces as specified above.Comment: This is my PhD dissertation in single line spacin","The study of the genetic program as a text, applying accepted rules of the theory of information (#AUTHOR_TAG and Weaver 1949;Cover and Thomas 1991) to its analysis (H��naut et al. 1996) resulted in the emphasis placed on DNA in synthetic biology.","['The study of the genetic program as a text, applying accepted rules of the theory of information (#AUTHOR_TAG and Weaver 1949;Cover and Thomas 1991) to its analysis (H��naut et al. 1996) resulted in the emphasis placed on DNA in synthetic biology.', 'Schneider created his famous ""logo"" representation of sequences (Schneider and Stephens 1990) in a model of molecular machines based on Shannon\'s information (Schneider 1991a, b).', 'His work was based on the intuition that creation of information was consuming energy (Schneider 1991b).', 'Furthermore, it assumed that the data has no meaning (hence no ""value""), and could be characterised purely by analysing the probability of presence of a given symbol in the sequence, generating its logo (Schneider and Stephens 1990).', 'A similar trend is visible in the way information is used in the mass media.', 'It is current writing-because all kinds of signals can be digitised-that everything has an information coded in sequences of (0,1), restricting the concept of information to that particular view of sequences of symbols, and forgetting about in-formation (creation and accumulation of information, or a value associated to an information).', 'The common feature of this conceptualisation is dematerialisation: the corresponding information becomes an abstract entity, which can be manipulated using mathematic tools.']",0,"['The study of the genetic program as a text, applying accepted rules of the theory of information (#AUTHOR_TAG and Weaver 1949;Cover and Thomas 1991) to its analysis (H��naut et al. 1996) resulted in the emphasis placed on DNA in synthetic biology.', 'Schneider created his famous ""logo"" representation of sequences (Schneider and Stephens 1990) in a model of molecular machines based on Shannon\'s information (Schneider 1991a, b).']"

One might be concerned that such reversibility will make the second law of thermodynamics vulnerable to the designs of the demon of choice, a selective version of Maxwell's demon. The strategy of the demon of choice is to take advantage of rare fluctuations to extract useful work, and to reversibly undo measurements which do not lead to such a favorable but unlikely outcomes. I show that this threat does not arise as the demon of choice cannot operate without recording (explicitely or implicitely) whether its measurement was a success (or a failure). Thermodynamic cost associated with such a record cannot be, on the average, made smaller than the gain of useful work derived from the fluctuations.Comment: 20 pages including figures in Te","In contrast to the traditional definitions of entropy, algorithmic randomness can be used to measure disorder without any recourse to probabilities"" (#AUTHOR_TAG 1989).","['Algorithmic complexity has been related to Shannon\'s information (Cover and Thomas 1991) and to physical entropy: ""Algorithmic randomness provides a rigorous, entropy-like measure of disorder of an individual, microscopic, definite state of a physical system.', 'It is defined by the size (in binary digits) of the shortest message specifying the microstate uniquely up to the assumed resolution.', 'Equivalently, algorithmic randomness can be expressed as the number of bits in the smallest program for a universal computer that can reproduce the state in question (for instance, by plotting it with the assumed accuracy).', 'In contrast to the traditional definitions of entropy, algorithmic randomness can be used to measure disorder without any recourse to probabilities"" (#AUTHOR_TAG 1989).', 'This success led many to think that we had a final Theory of Information, which could tell us what information is.']",4,"['In contrast to the traditional definitions of entropy, algorithmic randomness can be used to measure disorder without any recourse to probabilities"" (#AUTHOR_TAG 1989).']"

CC342,81867052,Information of the chassis and information of the program in synthetic cells,Antoine Danchin,Representation and Reality,"[""H Putnam""]","Part I raises the problems that will shape our investigation of representation. Locke's account is inadequate because of its failure  to allow any role to an agent who creates or understands the representational relation. Representation occurs mysteriously by means of mediating entities. This inadequacy becomes even more evident in contrast with Aquinas' account of the activity of mind: representation for Aquinas is an act (not an object) of mind. A reading of Aquinas  also illuminates the reasons for the extreme passivity of Locke's account, since its origins are clearly to be seen in the Thomist account, but Locke's version has lost the most important feature of the Thomist account. Descartes' conception of 'ideas' is ambivalent between act  and object; and, in examining some of the problems of his account, we shall see the importance of an intentional interpretation of representation: that it is an act of thought about some object. Part II develops the issues raised earlier within the  particular context of signification and semiotic theory. The semiotic theories of Saussure, Peirce .and Piaget are examined, with occasional reference to Frege. The theme of Chapters 4 to 6 is that a signifier  is only as good as the intelligence which uses it. It is not because humans have a sign system that they can achieve 'disengagement' from any particular 'here-and-now' context: other animals also use representative items, but not in the same way as humans do. Something more is required than just the availability of some physical item which can stand in for something else. There are various kinds of signifiers - broadly speaking, those which are used wittingly and those which are  unwittingly used - and what gives a signifier its particular structure is the manner of its use. Part II, then, deals with questions about the representative item and how it comes to represent other items. But this investigation reveals the importance of the representative act, and it is to this topic that we turn in the final Part.  Part III focuses on the activity of representation. What kind of act is it, and how is it possible? In Chapter 7 a distinction is made between active and passive senses of representation, and arising  out of this distinction we study the particular case of images, considered as a form of representation. Chapter 8 presents a contrast between non-representational (animal) thought and representational  thought, and this leads to a final discussion of the relationship between representation, thought and reality",Trying to match models with reality allowed scientists to progress by producing better and better adequation with reality (Danchin 1992;#AUTHOR_TAG 1988).,"['The importance of models to understand reality triggered the creation of axiomatics, mathematics and logics.', 'This effort was well fitted to the Renaissance trend to replace Aristotle by Plato, removing the thought of the former to the ""dark centuries"" of Middle Ages.', 'At the heart of platonistic philosophy, the shadows of mathematical archetypes had to be discovered by persons who were illuminated by their truth.', 'This attitude placed mathematics in the world of idealities, suggesting that mathematical certainties existed separately.', 'The medieval reflection on in-formation was soon replaced by a geometrical view of combinatorial creation of forms associated to the general structure of space, initially studied in one, two or three dimensions and later generalised to all kinds of dimensions.', 'In parallel, and following a medieval trend of arabic mathematics, arithmetics and number theory slowly emerged as algebraic equations.', 'Models recognised as of the highest quality were mathematical models, developing on their own, independently of reality with their in-built consistency (information).', 'Trying to match models with reality allowed scientists to progress by producing better and better adequation with reality (Danchin 1992;#AUTHOR_TAG 1988).', 'However, the match between models and reality could never be direct (a mathematical model of an aeroplane does not fly).', 'It rested on interpretations (processes rooted in culture and language, thus associated to a property that we might name context and linked to a research programme (Lakatos 1976(Lakatos , 1980).']",0,['Trying to match models with reality allowed scientists to progress by producing better and better adequation with reality (Danchin 1992;#AUTHOR_TAG 1988).']

However, whether and how such serial processing is achieved with a brain composed of massively parallel processors, remains an open question. Here, we study the cognitive architecture for chained operations with an elementary arithmetic algorithm: we required participants to add (or subtract) two to a digit, and then compare the result with five. In four experiments, we probed the internal implementation of this task with chronometric analysis, the cued-response method, the priming method, and a subliminal forced-choice procedure. We found evidence for an approximately sequential processing, with an important qualification: the second operation in the algorithm appears to start before completion of the first operation. Furthermore, initially the second operation takes as input the stimulus number rather than the output of the first operation.

Stochastic fluctuations in the cellular components that determine cellular states can cause two distinct subpopulations, a property called bistability. Phenotypic heterogeneity can be readily obtained by interlinking multiple gene regulatory pathways, effectively resulting in a genetic logic-AND gate. Although switching between states can occur within the cells' lifetime, cells can also pass their cellular state over to the next generation by a mechanism known as epigenetic inheritance and thus perpetuate the phenotypic state. Importantly, heterogeneous populations can demonstrate increased fitness compared with homogeneous populations. This suggests that microbial cells employ bet-hedging strategies to maximize survival.

Like all theoretical terms, it applies to many different domains of research. Like all theoretical terms, its meaning has dramatically changed over and over in time, and it has been defined in so many different operational ways. The problem is that the descriptive content of the various definitions of the genes that exist do not coincide. This paper provides a general evaluation of this situation. Firstly it shows that the theoretical concepts of classical genetics cannot be correlated unambiguously with the theoretical concepts of molecular genetics. In fact, there is no agreement on such simple questions as: Where are the genes? When do they exist? What are they? How many? Secondly, it provides an interpretation of why biologists continue to use the word 'gene'.

Comparing 55 genomes of Firmicutes and Gamma-proteobacteria to identify the genes which, while persistent among genomes, do not lead to a lethal phenotype when inactivated, we show that the characteristics of persistence, conservation, expression, and location are shared between persistent nonessential (PNE) genes and experimentally essential genes. PNE genes show an overrepresentation of genes related to maintenance and stress response. This outlines the limits of current experimental techniques to define gene essentiality and highlights the essential role of genes implicated in maintenance which, although dispensable for growth, are not dispensable from an evolutionary point of view. Firmicutes and Gamma-proteobacteria are mostly differing in the construction of the cell envelope, DNA replication and proofreading, and RNA degradation. In addition to suggesting functions for persistent genes that had until now resisted identification, we show that these genes have many characters in common with experimentally identified essential genes. They should then be regarded as truly essential genes.","To identify ubiquitous functions operated by non-ubiquitous structures one had to devise an operational strategy, based on the concept of gene persistence (tendency of a given gene to be present in a quorum of species) (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2005).","['As with computer OSs, the housekeeping program is abstract and general, yet its concrete implementation, resulting from billions of years of evolution, makes that several OSs may coexist, revealing again two kinds of information, information of the program and information of the context in which the program is expressed.', 'This has considerable consequences for synthetic biology: cellular functions can be general and ubiquitous, whereas there is no reason why they should always be performed by structurally related objects.', 'Overall, living cells display similar abstract features, and the genetic code argues for universality.', 'Yet, Woese uncovered a significant discrepancy between two unicellular classes, the Archaea and the Bacteria (Woese et al. 1978).', 'To identify ubiquitous functions operated by non-ubiquitous structures one had to devise an operational strategy, based on the concept of gene persistence (tendency of a given gene to be present in a quorum of species) (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2005).', 'Different structural entities with common functions in different bacterial clades were indeed characterised (Danchin 2009b;Woese 2002).', 'A structure is therefore recruited for a particular function, dependent on the context in which it operates.', 'The context creates the function.']",4,"['To identify ubiquitous functions operated by non-ubiquitous structures one had to devise an operational strategy, based on the concept of gene persistence (tendency of a given gene to be present in a quorum of species) (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2005).']"

It is suggested that the magnetic 'face' of the minerals from the inorganic world, recognized to have played a pivotal role in initiating Life, may throw light on some of these issues. A magnetic environment in the form of rocks in the Hadean Ocean could have enabled the accretion and therefore an ordered confinement of super-paramagnetic colloids within a structured phase. A moderate H-field can help magnetic nano-particles to not only overcome thermal fluctuations but also harness them. Such controlled dynamics brings in the possibility of accessing quantum effects, which together with frustrations in magnetic ordering and hysteresis (a natural mechanism for a primitive memory) could throw light on the birth of biological information which, as Abel argues, requires a combination of order and complexity. This scenario gains strength from observations of scale-free framboidal forms of the greigite mineral, with a magnetic basis of assembly. And greigite's metabolic potential plays a key role in the mound scenario of Russell and coworkers-an expansion of which is suggested for including magnetism.Comment: 42 pages, 5 figures, to be published in A.R.

The distribution of such state over cells, however, is not only a result of intracellular stochastic process, but is also influenced by the growth in cell numbers that depends on the state. By incorporating the growth-death process into the standard Fokker--Planck equation for the probability distribution, a nonlinear temporal evolution equation of distribution is obtained that includes a self-consistent growth term. The derived equation is generally solved analytically by means of eigenfunction expansions. By focusing on the case with linear relaxation, two examples are considered as applications of the proposed general formalism. First, by assuming that the growth rate of a cell increases linearly with the state value $x$, the shift of the average state value $x$ due to the growth effect is shown to be proportional to the variance of the state $x$ and the relaxation time, similarly with the biological fluctuation- response relationship. Second, when there is a gap in the growth rate at some threshold value for the state $x$, existence of a critical gap value is demonstrated, beyond which the average growth rate starts to increase. This critical value is again obtained in terms of the relaxation time and the variance of $x$, all of which are experimentally measurable quantities. The relevance of the results to the analysis of biological data on the distribution of cell states, as obtained for example by flow cytometry, is discussed.Comment: 16 pages, 4 figure",Different structural entities with common functions in different bacterial clades were indeed characterised (Danchin 2009b;#AUTHOR_TAG 2002).,"['As with computer OSs, the housekeeping program is abstract and general, yet its concrete implementation, resulting from billions of years of evolution, makes that several OSs may coexist, revealing again two kinds of information, information of the program and information of the context in which the program is expressed.', 'This has considerable consequences for synthetic biology: cellular functions can be general and ubiquitous, whereas there is no reason why they should always be performed by structurally related objects.', 'Overall, living cells display similar abstract features, and the genetic code argues for universality.', 'Yet, Woese uncovered a significant discrepancy between two unicellular classes, the Archaea and the Bacteria (Woese et al. 1978).', 'To identify ubiquitous functions operated by non-ubiquitous structures one had to devise an operational strategy, based on the concept of gene persistence (tendency of a given gene to be present in a quorum of species) (Fang et al. 2005).', 'Different structural entities with common functions in different bacterial clades were indeed characterised (Danchin 2009b;#AUTHOR_TAG 2002).', 'A structure is therefore recruited for a particular function, dependent on the context in which it operates.', 'The context creates the function.']",0,"['Different structural entities with common functions in different bacterial clades were indeed characterised (Danchin 2009b;#AUTHOR_TAG 2002).', 'A structure is therefore recruited for a particular function, dependent on the context in which it operates.', 'The context creates the function.']"

Schneider""]","Single molecules perform a variety of tasks in cells, from replicating, controlling and translating the genetic material to sensing the outside environment. These operations all require that specific actions take place. In a sense, each molecule must make tiny decisions. To make a decision, each ""molecular machine"" must dissipate an energy Py in the presence of thermal noise Ny. The number of binary decisions that can be made by a machine which has dspace independently moving parts is the ""machine capacity"" Cy = dspace log2 [(Py + Ny)/Ny]. This formula is closely related to Shannon's channel capacity for communications systems, C = W log2 [(P + N)/N]. This paper shows that the minimum amount of energy that a molecular machine must dissipate in order to gain one bit of information is epsilon min = kB T ln (2) joules/bit. This equation is derived in two distinct ways. The first derivation begins with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which shows that the statement that there is a minimum energy dissipation is a restatement of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The second derivation begins with the machine capacity formula, which shows that the machine capacity is also related to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. One of Shannon's theorems for communications channels is that as long as the channel capacity is not exceeded, the error rate may be made as small as desired by a sufficiently involved coding. This result also applies to the dissipation formula for molecular machines. So there is a precise upper bound on the number of choices a molecular machine can make for a given amount of energy loss. This result will be important for the design and construction of molecular computers.",His work was based on the intuition that creation of information was consuming energy (#AUTHOR_TAG 1991b).,"['The study of the genetic program as a text, applying accepted rules of the theory of information (Shannon and Weaver 1949;Cover and Thomas 1991) to its analysis (H��naut et al. 1996) resulted in the emphasis placed on DNA in synthetic biology.', 'Schneider created his famous ""logo"" representation of sequences (Schneider and Stephens 1990) in a model of molecular machines based on Shannon\'s information (Schneider 1991a, b).', 'His work was based on the intuition that creation of information was consuming energy (#AUTHOR_TAG 1991b).', 'Furthermore, it assumed that the data has no meaning (hence no ""value""), and could be characterised purely by analysing the probability of presence of a given symbol in the sequence, generating its logo (Schneider and Stephens 1990).', 'A similar trend is visible in the way information is used in the mass media.', 'It is current writing-because all kinds of signals can be digitised-that everything has an information coded in sequences of (0,1), restricting the concept of information to that particular view of sequences of symbols, and forgetting about in-formation (creation and accumulation of information, or a value associated to an information).', 'The common feature of this conceptualisation is dematerialisation: the corresponding information becomes an abstract entity, which can be manipulated using mathematic tools.']",1,"['The study of the genetic program as a text, applying accepted rules of the theory of information (Shannon and Weaver 1949;Cover and Thomas 1991) to its analysis (Hnaut et al. 1996) resulted in the emphasis placed on DNA in synthetic biology.', 'Schneider created his famous ""logo"" representation of sequences (Schneider and Stephens 1990) in a model of molecular machines based on Shannon\'s information (Schneider 1991a, b).', 'His work was based on the intuition that creation of information was consuming energy (#AUTHOR_TAG 1991b).']"

Eddington"", ""Timothy J. Strauman"", ""Roberto Cabeza""]","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by the presence of disturbances in emotional processing. However, the neural correlates of these alterations, and how they may be affected by therapeutic interventions, remain unclear. The present study addressed these issues in a preliminary investigation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neural responses to positive, negative, and neutral pictures in unmedicated MDD patients (N = 22) versus controls (N = 14). After this initial scan, MDD patients were treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and scanned again after treatment. Within regions that showed pre-treatment differences between patients and controls, we tested the association between pre-treatment activity and subsequent treatment response as well as activity changes from pre- to post-treatment. This study yielded three main findings. First, prior to treatment and relative to controls, patients exhibited overall reduced activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), diminished discrimination between emotional and neutral items in the amygdala, caudate, and hippocampus, and enhanced responses to negative versus positive stimuli in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and right dorsolateral PFC. Second, CBT-related symptom improvement in MDD patients was predicted by increased activity at baseline in ventromedial PFC as well as the valence effects in the ATL and dorsolateral PFC. Third, from pre- to post-treatment, MDD patients exhibited overall increases in ventromedial PFC activation, enhanced arousal responses in the amygdala, caudate, and hippocampus, and a reversal of valence effects in the ATL. The study was limited by the relatively small sample that was able to complete both scan sessions, as well as an inability to determine the influence of comorbid disorders within the current sample. Nevertheless, components of the neural networks corresponding to emotion processing disturbances in MDD appear to resolve following treatment and are predictive of treatment response, possibly reflecting improvements in emotion regulation processes in response to CBT.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Accamma"", ""H. N. Suma""]","The last two decades have seen a surge in the interest in research based on Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. Decoding of cognitive states based on fMRI activation profiles has become a very active topic in this area. fMRI data is very high dimensional and noisy. However, there is a dearth of datasets to work on. Sharing of learning by analyzing datasets drawn across multiple subjects in an experiment can help in increasing the amount of data we have for analysis. Decoding of cognitive states using classifiers trained across multiple subjects is a challenging task because of differences in anatomy and cognition. Selecting features to analyze from the dataset is a key step in the analysis of fMRI data. In this paper we apply PCA, ICA and five non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques to the fMRI data. The aim of this work is to analyze which technique can provide the best feature selection to capture the commonality across multiple subjects. The reduced datasets are then used to train classifiers to solve a multiple-subject decoding problem.","Beginnings are starting to be made in reproducing data across as well as within subjects (#AUTHOR_TAG and Suma, 2012;Raizada and Connolly, 2012).","['An analogous challenge has arisen in fMRI studies of visual perception.', 'Early attempts to localize specific perceptions to specific brain areas worked only for grossly different stimuli-visualizing navigating a house compared to imagining playing tennis (Owen et al., 2006)-or for simple stimuli in early, highly specialized, visual areas (Kay et al., 2008).', 'More latterly, however, multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), in which patterns of activity across wide areas of the brain are analyzed, has produced a significant increase in cognitive resolution.', 'Fairly similar stimuli, for example chairs and shoes (Norman et al., 2006;deCharms, 2008;Poldrack, 2011), or over-riding categories of images such as living or non-living (Naselaris et al., 2012) can now be recognized from pattern information fMRI (Formisano and Kriegeskorte, 2012) data.', 'Not only perceptions, but also images and memories (Chadwick et al., 2012;Rissman and Wagner, 2012) are starting to be distinguished.', 'Beginnings are starting to be made in reproducing data across as well as within subjects (#AUTHOR_TAG and Suma, 2012;Raizada and Connolly, 2012).', 'Significantly, cognitive resolution appears to increase as the focus of the analysis is widened to include more brain areas.']",0,"['An analogous challenge has arisen in fMRI studies of visual perception.', 'Early attempts to localize specific perceptions to specific brain areas worked only for grossly different stimuli-visualizing navigating a house compared to imagining playing tennis (Owen et al., 2006)-or for simple stimuli in early, highly specialized, visual areas (Kay et al., 2008).', 'More latterly, however, multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), in which patterns of activity across wide areas of the brain are analyzed, has produced a significant increase in cognitive resolution.', 'Beginnings are starting to be made in reproducing data across as well as within subjects (#AUTHOR_TAG and Suma, 2012;Raizada and Connolly, 2012).', 'Significantly, cognitive resolution appears to increase as the focus of the analysis is widened to include more brain areas.']"

Stansbury"", ""Jack L. Gallant""]","The representations of animate and inanimate objects appear to be anatomically and functionally dissociated in the primate brain. How much of the variation in object-category tuning across cortical locations can be explained in terms of the animate/inanimate distinction? How is the distinction between animate and inanimate reflected in the arrangement of object representations along the cortical surface? To investigate these issues we recorded BOLD activity in visual cortex while subjects viewed streams of natural scenes. We then constructed an explicit model of object-category tuning for each voxel along the cortical surface. We verified that these models accurately predict responses to novel scenes for voxels located in anterior visual areas, and that they can be used to accurately decode multiple objects simultaneously from novel scenes. Finally, we used principal components analysis to characterize the variation in object-category tuning across voxels. Remarkably, we found that the first principal component reflects the distinction between animate and inanimate objects. This dimension accounts for between 50 and 60% of the total variation in object-category tuning across voxels in anterior visual areas. The importance of the animate-inanimate distinction is further reflected in the arrangement of voxels on the cortical surface: voxels that prefer animate objects tend to be located anterior to retinotopic visual areas and are flanked by voxels that prefer inanimate objects. Our explicit model of object-category tuning thus explains the anatomical and functional dissociation of animate and inanimate objects.Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study aimed to identify changes in brain activation following cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in subjects suffering from specific phobia.

Phobics were randomly assigned to a therapy-group (TG) and a waiting-list control group (WG). Both groups of phobics were scanned twice. Between scanning sessions, CBT was given to the TG. Before therapy, brain activation did not differ between both groups of phobics. As compared to control subjects, phobics showed greater responses to spider vs. control videos in the insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). CBT strongly reduced phobic symptoms in the TG while the WG remained behaviorally unchanged. In the second scanning session, a significant reduction of hyperactivity in the insula and ACC was found in the TG compared to the WG.

We replicated an earlier comparison of treatment approaches in a sample four times larger and restricted to primary-care mental health. Method Patients (n=5613) who received cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), person-centred therapy (PCT) or psychodynamic therapy (PDT) at one of 32 NHS primary-care services during a 3-year period (2002-2005) completed the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) at the beginning and end of treatment. Therapists indicated which approaches were used on an End of Therapy form. We compared outcomes of groups treated with CBT (n=1045), PCT (n=1709), or PDT (n=261) only or with one of these plus one additional approach (e.g. integrative, supportive, art), designated CBT+1 (n=1035), PCT+1 (n=1033), or PDT+1 (n=530), respectively. Results All six groups began treatment with equivalent CORE-OM scores, and all averaged marked improvement (overall pre/post effect size=1.39).

Multiple previous studies suggest that activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate predicts outcome in CT for depression, but there have been no prospective replications.Objective This study prospectively examined whether subgenual cingulate activity is a reliable and robust prognostic outcome marker for CT for depression and whether its activity changes in treatment. Design Two inception cohorts were assessed with fMRI on different scanners on a task sensitive to sustained emotional information processing before and after 16Ð20 sessions of CT, along with a sample of control participants tested at comparable intervals. Setting Therapy took place in a hospital outpatient clinic. Patients Participants included 49 unmedicated depressed adults and 35 healthy control participants. Main Outcome Measures Pre-treatment subgenual anterior cingulate activity in an a priori region in response to negative words was correlated with residual severity and used to classify response and remission. Results As expected, in both samples, participants with the lowest pre-treatment sustained subgenual cingulate (sgACC; BA25) reactivity in response to negative words displayed the most improvement in CT (R2=.29, >75% correct classification of response, >70% correct classification of remission). Other a priori regions explained additional variance. Response/Remission in Cohort 2 was predicted based on thresholds from Cohort 1. sgACC activity remained low for remitters following treatment. Conclusions Neuroimaging provides a quick, valid, and clinically applicable way of assessing neural systems associated with treatment response/remission. sgACC activity, in particular, may reflect processes which interfere with treatment, e.g,. emotion generation in addition to its putative regulatory role; alternately, its absence may facilitate treatment response.","Pretreatment levels of cingulate activity can even predict response to CBT with some reliability (Konarski et al., 2009;Ritchey et al., 2011;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012).","['The dominant paradigm has been to compare levels of brain activity pre and post CBT to see what changes.', 'This approach has mainly been used in depression and has identified that changes are localized to specific frontal, cingulate, and limbic areas.', 'There is decreased activity in the limbic system, especially  (Benson et al., 1999) Cornelissen et al., 2013 the amygdala, with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex becoming relatively more active and orbitomedial and cingulate cortex less so; a move toward normality from patterns observed before treatment (Ochsner et al., 2002;Goldapple et al., 2004;Malhi et al., 2004;Ritchey et al., 2011;H�_flich et al., 2012) and consistent with what is know of the processing of emotional stimuli (Simpson et al., 2000;Northoff et al., 2004;Lepp�_nen, 2006;Beck, 2008).', 'Pretreatment levels of cingulate activity can even predict response to CBT with some reliability (Konarski et al., 2009;Ritchey et al., 2011;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012).']",0,"['Pretreatment levels of cingulate activity can even predict response to CBT with some reliability (Konarski et al., 2009;Ritchey et al., 2011;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012).']"

Over the past decade, researchers have increasingly utilized powerful analytical tools (e.g., multivoxel pattern analysis) to decode the information represented within distributed functional magnetic resonance imaging activity patterns. In this review, we discuss how these methods can sensitively index neural representations of perceptual and semantic content and how leverage on the engagement of distributed representations provides unique insights into distinct aspects of memory-guided behavior. We emphasize that, in addition to characterizing the contents of memories, analyses of distributed patterns shed light on the processes that influence how information is encoded, maintained, or retrieved, and thus inform memory theory.

S. Raizada"", ""Andrew C.

Recent research in multivoxel pattern-based fMRI analysis has led to considerable success at decoding within individual subjects. However, the goal of being able to decode across subjects is still challenging: It has remained unclear what population-level regularities of neural representation there might be. Here, we present a novel and highly accurate solution to this problem, which decodes across subjects between eight different stimulus conditions. The key to finding this solution was questioning the seemingly obvious idea that neural decoding should work directly on neural activation patterns. On the contrary, to decode across subjects, it is beneficial to abstract away from subject-specific patterns of neural activity and, instead, to operate on the similarity relations between those patterns: Our new approach performs decoding purely within similarity space. These results demonstrate a hitherto unknown population-level regularity in neural representation and also reveal a striking convergence between our empirical findings in fMRI and discussions in the philosophy of mind addressing the problem of conceptual similarity across neural diversity.","Beginnings are starting to be made in reproducing data across as well as within subjects (Accamma and Suma, 2012;#AUTHOR_TAG and Connolly, 2012).","['An analogous challenge has arisen in fMRI studies of visual perception.', 'Early attempts to localize specific perceptions to specific brain areas worked only for grossly different stimuli-visualizing navigating a house compared to imagining playing tennis (Owen et al., 2006)-or for simple stimuli in early, highly specialized, visual areas (Kay et al., 2008).', 'More latterly, however, multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), in which patterns of activity across wide areas of the brain are analyzed, has produced a significant increase in cognitive resolution.', 'Fairly similar stimuli, for example chairs and shoes (Norman et al., 2006;deCharms, 2008;Poldrack, 2011), or over-riding categories of images such as living or non-living (Naselaris et al., 2012) can now be recognized from pattern information fMRI (Formisano and Kriegeskorte, 2012) data.', 'Not only perceptions, but also images and memories (Chadwick et al., 2012;Rissman and Wagner, 2012) are starting to be distinguished.', 'Beginnings are starting to be made in reproducing data across as well as within subjects (Accamma and Suma, 2012;#AUTHOR_TAG and Connolly, 2012).', 'Significantly, cognitive resolution appears to increase as the focus of the analysis is widened to include more brain areas.']",0,"['An analogous challenge has arisen in fMRI studies of visual perception.', 'Beginnings are starting to be made in reproducing data across as well as within subjects (Accamma and Suma, 2012;#AUTHOR_TAG and Connolly, 2012).']"

With respect to this issue, positron emission tomography (PET) findings indicate that cognitive and behavioral modifications, occurring in a psychotherapeutic context, can lead to regional brain metabolic changes in patients with major depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder. The goal of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, which constitutes the first neuroimaging investigation of the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) using an emotional activation paradigm, was to probe the effects of CBT on the neural correlates of spider phobia. In order to do so, fMRI was used in subjects suffering from spider phobia (n = 12) to measure, before and after effective CBT, regional brain activity during the viewing of film excerpts depicting spiders. Normal control subjects were also scanned (once) while they were exposed to the same film excerpts. Results showed that, in phobic subjects before CBT, the transient state of fear triggered, during the viewing of the phobogenic stimuli, was correlated with significant activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area-BA 10), the parahippocampal gyrus, and the visual associative cortical areas, bilaterally. For normal control subjects (n = 13), only the left middle occipital gyrus and the right inferior temporal gyrus were significantly activated. In phobic subjects before CBT, the activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 10) may reflect the use of metacognitive strategies aimed at self-regulating the fear triggered by the spider film excerpts, whereas the parahippocampal activation might be related to an automatic reactivation of the contextual fear memory that led to the development of avoidance behavior and the maintenance of spider phobia. After successful completion of CBT, no significant activation was found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 10) or the parahippocampal gyrus. These findings suggest that a psychotherapeutic approach, such as CBT, has the potential to modify the dysfunctional neural circuitry associated with anxiety disorders. They further indicate that the changes made at the mind level, within a psychotherapeutic context, are able to functionally ""rewire"" the brain.","For example, very similar changes in those brain areas are seen after CBT and other psychological treatments for anxiety (Furmark et al., 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2003;Straube et al., 2006;Porto et al., 2009;Freyer et al., 2011), schizophrenia (Wykes et al., 2002), eating disorders (Vocks et al., 2011) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (Lackner et al., 2006).","['However, a one to one correspondence between change in depression and change in specific brain areas may be over stated (Linden, 2006;Frewen et al., 2008;Dichter et al., 2012).', 'For example, very similar changes in those brain areas are seen after CBT and other psychological treatments for anxiety (Furmark et al., 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2003;Straube et al., 2006;Porto et al., 2009;Freyer et al., 2011), schizophrenia (Wykes et al., 2002), eating disorders (Vocks et al., 2011) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (Lackner et al., 2006).', 'This is consistent with a consciousness network which depends upon these brain areas (and no doubt others) but it also suggests that there is a large overlap in the brain changes associated with different holistic states of consciousness.', 'At present, fMRI data would suggest that, simply put, CBT is associated with a decrease in emotionality (less limbic activity) and an increase in thoughtfulness (increased dorsolateral frontal activity), as would be expected from its aims and methods (Clark and Beck, 2010).', 'Though we may be able to link consciousness to a subset of anatomical structures using psychotherapy as an investigative tool, we appear to lack specificity in our account of how different states of consciousness could arise.', 'Is it that in using psychotherapy to localize holistic changes in consciousness to a restricted set of brain structures, we have lost the ability to account for why consciousness is so idiosyncratic and so changeable?']",0,"['For example, very similar changes in those brain areas are seen after CBT and other psychological treatments for anxiety (Furmark et al., 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2003;Straube et al., 2006;Porto et al., 2009;Freyer et al., 2011), schizophrenia (Wykes et al., 2002), eating disorders (Vocks et al., 2011) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (Lackner et al., 2006).']"

Nevertheless the neural correlates underlying emotional-cognitive interaction remain unclear. Using event-related fMRI, we investigated BOLD-signal increases and decreases in medial and lateral prefrontal cortical regions during emotional and non-emotional judgment of photographs taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Emotional and non-emotional judgment conditions were compared to each other as well as with baseline allowing for distinction between relative signal changes (comparison between conditions) and true signal changes (referring to baseline). We have found that: (1) both emotional and non-emotional judgment of IAPS pictures were characterized by signal increases in ventrally and dorsally located lateral prefrontal cortical areas and concurrent signal decreases in ventro- and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; (2) direct comparison between emotional and non-emotional judgment showed relative signal increases in ventro- and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and in contrast, relative signal increases were detected in ventrally and dorsally located lateral prefrontal cortical areas when comparing non-emotional to emotional judgment; and (3) as shown in separate comparisons with baseline, these relative signal changes were due to smaller signal decreases in ventro- and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and smaller signal increases in ventrally and dorsally located lateral prefrontal cortical areas during emotional judgment. Therefore, the emotional load of a cognitive task lead to both less deactivation of medial prefrontal regions and, at the same time, less activation of lateral prefrontal regions. Analogous patterns of reciprocal modulation and attenuation have previously been described for other cortical regions such as visual and auditory areas. Reciprocal modulation and attenuation in medial and lateral prefrontal cortex might constitute the neurophysiologic basis for emotional-cognitive interaction as observed in both healthy and psychiatric subjects.

METHOD Three groups (patients receiving control therapy or CRT and a healthy control group) were investigated in a repeated measures design using the two-back test. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and a broad assessment of executive functioning were completed at baseline and post-treatment. Brain activation changes were identified after accounting for possible task-correlated motion artefact.

CC377,82854584,Psychotherapy and brain plasticity,Daniel Collerton,Core processes of psychopathology and recovery,"[""Warren Mansell""]","This editorial proposes that the task of identifying common processes across disorders and across psychotherapies will be the most fruitful way to develop efficient, easily trainable and coherent psychological interventions. The article adapts the concept of the ÔDodo Bird EffectÕ to argue for a mechanistic, testable account of functioning, akin to other unified approaches in science. The articles in the special issue complement this perspective in several ways: (1) three articles identify common processes across disorders within the domains of anger dysregulation, sleep disruption and perfectionism; (2) one article emphasises a case conceptualisation approach that is applied across different disorders and integrates theoretical approaches; (3) three articles focus on the utility of a control theory approach to understand the core processes of maintenance and change. Critically, there is a consensus that change involves facilitating the integration within the client's awareness of higher level, self-determined goals (e.g. insight; cognitive reappraisal) with their lower level regulation of present-moment experience (e.g. emotional openness; exposure). Taken together, these articles illustrate the benefits of a convergent rather than divergent approach to the science and practice of psychological therapy, and they strive to identify common ground across psychotherapies and across widely different presentations of psychopathology.","The outcomes of psychodynamic, personcentred, and behavioral psychotherapy are broadly equivalent despite their varieties of approaches and targets for therapeutic change (Stiles et al., 2008;Budd and Hughes, 2009) perhaps because they work via common final paths (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2011).","['Similarly, though there is evidence that different modalities of therapy may have different levels of effectiveness (see Tolin, 2010 for a meta-analytic comparison of CBT with other therapies), where this does occur this appears to be more a quantitative than a qualitative difference.', 'The outcomes of psychodynamic, personcentred, and behavioral psychotherapy are broadly equivalent despite their varieties of approaches and targets for therapeutic change (Stiles et al., 2008;Budd and Hughes, 2009) perhaps because they work via common final paths (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2011).']",0,"['The outcomes of psychodynamic, personcentred, and behavioral psychotherapy are broadly equivalent despite their varieties of approaches and targets for therapeutic change (Stiles et al., 2008;Budd and Hughes, 2009) perhaps because they work via common final paths (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2011).']"

Ward"", ""Veena Kumari"", ""Philip B. Mitchell"", ""Gordon B. Parker"", ""Belinda Ivanovski"", ""Perminder Sachdev""]","Individuals with bipolar disorder manifest the full spectrum of emotions ranging from depression to mania. In attempting to understand the functional substrates of mood we attempted to identify brain regions associated with the cognitive generation of affect in bipolar depressed patients. We therefore examined ten depressed female subjects with bipolar affective disorder, and ten age-matched and sex-matched healthy comparison subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing alternating blocks of captioned pictures designed to evoke negative, positive or no affective change. The activation paradigm involved the presentation of the same visual materials over three experiments alternating (experiment 1) negative and reference; (experiment 2) positive and reference and (experiment 3) positive and negative captioned pictures. The stimuli produced activation in both patients and comparison subjects in brain regions previously implicated in the generation and modulation of affect, in particular the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. The activation in patients, when compared with healthy subjects, involved additional subcortical regions, in particular the amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus and medial globus pallidus. Patients and comparison subjects displayed differential sensitivity to affective change with negative (experiment 1) and positive (experiment 2) affect induction producing converse patterns of activation. We conclude that bipolar depressed patients perhaps recruit additional subcortical limbic systems for emotional evaluation and this may reflect state-related or trait-related dysfunction. The differential patterns of activation inform us about bipolar depression and have potential diagnostic and therapeutic significance.","There is decreased activity in the limbic system, especially  (Benson et al., 1999) Cornelissen et al., 2013 the amygdala, with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex becoming relatively more active and orbitomedial and cingulate cortex less so; a move toward normality from patterns observed before treatment (Ochsner et al., 2002;Goldapple et al., 2004;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2004;Ritchey et al., 2011;H�_flich et al., 2012) and consistent with what is know of the processing of emotional stimuli (Simpson et al., 2000;Northoff et al., 2004;Lepp�_nen, 2006;Beck, 2008).","['The dominant paradigm has been to compare levels of brain activity pre and post CBT to see what changes.', 'This approach has mainly been used in depression and has identified that changes are localized to specific frontal, cingulate, and limbic areas.', 'There is decreased activity in the limbic system, especially  (Benson et al., 1999) Cornelissen et al., 2013 the amygdala, with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex becoming relatively more active and orbitomedial and cingulate cortex less so; a move toward normality from patterns observed before treatment (Ochsner et al., 2002;Goldapple et al., 2004;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2004;Ritchey et al., 2011;H�_flich et al., 2012) and consistent with what is know of the processing of emotional stimuli (Simpson et al., 2000;Northoff et al., 2004;Lepp�_nen, 2006;Beck, 2008).', 'Pretreatment levels of cingulate activity can even predict response to CBT with some reliability (Konarski et al., 2009;Ritchey et al., 2011;Siegle et al., 2012).']",0,"['There is decreased activity in the limbic system, especially  (Benson et al., 1999) Cornelissen et al., 2013 the amygdala, with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex becoming relatively more active and orbitomedial and cingulate cortex less so; a move toward normality from patterns observed before treatment (Ochsner et al., 2002;Goldapple et al., 2004;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2004;Ritchey et al., 2011;H�_flich et al., 2012) and consistent with what is know of the processing of emotional stimuli (Simpson et al., 2000;Northoff et al., 2004;Lepp�_nen, 2006;Beck, 2008).']"
CC379,82854584,Psychotherapy and brain plasticity,Daniel Collerton,How psychotherapy changes the brain â€“ the contribution of functional neuroimaging,"[""D E J Linden""]","A thorough investigation of the neural effects of psychotherapy is needed in order to provide a neurobiological foundation for widely used treatment protocols. This paper reviews functional neuroimaging studies on psychotherapy effects and their methodological background, including the development of symptom provocation techniques. Studies of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) effects in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) were consistent in showing decreased metabolism in the right caudate nucleus. Cognitive behavioural therapy in phobia resulted in decreased activity in limbic and paralimbic areas. Interestingly, similar effects were observed after successful intervention with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in both diseases, indicating commonalities in the biological mechanisms of psycho- and pharmacotherapy. These findings are discussed in the context of current neurobiological models of anxiety disorders. Findings in depression, where both decreases and increases in prefrontal metabolism after treatment and considerable differences between pharmacological and psychological interventions were reported, seem still too heterogeneous to allow for an integrative account, but point to important differences between the mechanisms through which these interventions attain their clinical effects. Further studies with larger patient numbers, use of standardised imaging protocols across studies, and ideally integration with molecular imaging are needed to clarify the remaining contradictions. This effort is worthwhile because functional imaging can then be potentially used to monitor treatment effects and aid in the choice of the optimal therapy. Finally, recent advances in the functional imaging of hypnosis and the application of neurofeedback are evaluated for their potential use in the development of psychotherapy protocols that use the direct modulation of brain activity as a way of improving symptoms.","However, a one to one correspondence between change in depression and change in specific brain areas may be over stated (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2006;Frewen et al., 2008;Dichter et al., 2012).","['However, a one to one correspondence between change in depression and change in specific brain areas may be over stated (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2006;Frewen et al., 2008;Dichter et al., 2012).', 'For example, very similar changes in those brain areas are seen after CBT and other psychological treatments for anxiety (Furmark et al., 2002;Paquette et al., 2003;Straube et al., 2006;Porto et al., 2009;Freyer et al., 2011), schizophrenia (Wykes et al., 2002), eating disorders (Vocks et al., 2011) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (Lackner et al., 2006).', 'This is consistent with a consciousness network which depends upon these brain areas (and no doubt others) but it also suggests that there is a large overlap in the brain changes associated with different holistic states of consciousness.', 'At present, fMRI data would suggest that, simply put, CBT is associated with a decrease in emotionality (less limbic activity) and an increase in thoughtfulness (increased dorsolateral frontal activity), as would be expected from its aims and methods (Clark and Beck, 2010).', 'Though we may be able to link consciousness to a subset of anatomical structures using psychotherapy as an investigative tool, we appear to lack specificity in our account of how different states of consciousness could arise.', 'Is it that in using psychotherapy to localize holistic changes in consciousness to a restricted set of brain structures, we have lost the ability to account for why consciousness is so idiosyncratic and so changeable?']",0,"['However, a one to one correspondence between change in depression and change in specific brain areas may be over stated (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2006;Frewen et al., 2008;Dichter et al., 2012).']"

We note that, despite thirty years of meta-analytic reviews tending to support the finding of therapy equivalence, this view is still controversial and has not been accepted by many within the psychological therapy community; we explore this from a theory of science perspective. It is further argued that the equivalence of ostensibly different therapies is an inevitable consequence of the methodology that has dominated this field of investigation; namely, randomised controlled trials [RCTs]. The implicit assumptions of RCTs are analysed and it is argued that what we know about psychological therapy indicates that it is not appropriate to treat 'type of therapy' and 'diagnosis' as if they were independent variables in an experimental design. It is noted that one logical consequence of this is that we would not expect RCTs to be capable of isolating effects that are specific to 'type of therapy' and 'diagnosis'. Rather, RCTs would only be expected to be capable of identifying the non-specific effects of covariates, such as those of therapist allegiance. It is further suggested that those non-specific effects that have been identified via meta-analysis are not trivial findings, but rather characterise important features of psychological therapy.","The outcomes of psychodynamic, personcentred, and behavioral psychotherapy are broadly equivalent despite their varieties of approaches and targets for therapeutic change (Stiles et al., 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG and Hughes, 2009) perhaps because they work via common final paths (Mansell, 2011).","['Similarly, though there is evidence that different modalities of therapy may have different levels of effectiveness (see Tolin, 2010 for a meta-analytic comparison of CBT with other therapies), where this does occur this appears to be more a quantitative than a qualitative difference.', 'The outcomes of psychodynamic, personcentred, and behavioral psychotherapy are broadly equivalent despite their varieties of approaches and targets for therapeutic change (Stiles et al., 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG and Hughes, 2009) perhaps because they work via common final paths (Mansell, 2011).']",0,"['Similarly, though there is evidence that different modalities of therapy may have different levels of effectiveness (see Tolin, 2010 for a meta-analytic comparison of CBT with other therapies), where this does occur this appears to be more a quantitative than a qualitative difference.', 'The outcomes of psychodynamic, personcentred, and behavioral psychotherapy are broadly equivalent despite their varieties of approaches and targets for therapeutic change (Stiles et al., 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG and Hughes, 2009) perhaps because they work via common final paths (Mansell, 2011).']"

Beck""]","Although the cognitive model of depression has evolved appreciably since its first formulation over 40 years ago, the potential interaction of genetic, neurochemical, and cognitive factors has only recently been demonstrated. Combining findings from behavioral genetics and cognitive neuroscience with the accumulated research on the cognitive model opens new opportunities for integrated research. Drawing on advances in cognitive, personality, and social psychology as well as clinical observations, expansions of the original cognitive model have incorporated in successive stages automatic thoughts, cognitive distortions, dysfunctional beliefs, and information-processing biases. The developmental model identified early traumatic experiences and the formation of dysfunctional beliefs as predisposing events and congruent stressors in later life as precipitating factors. It is now possible to sketch out possible genetic and neurochemical pathways that interact with or are parallel to cognitive variables. A hypersensitive amygdala is associated with both a genetic polymorphism and a pattern of negative cognitive biases and dysfunctional beliefs, all of which constitute risk factors for depression. Further, the combination of a hyperactive amygdala and hypoactive prefrontal regions is associated with diminished cognitive appraisal and the occurrence of depression. Genetic polymorphisms also are involved in the overreaction to the stress and the hypercortisolemia in the development of depression--probably mediated by cognitive distortions. I suggest that comprehensive study of the psychological as well as biological correlates of depression can provide a new understanding of this debilitating disorder.","There is decreased activity in the limbic system, especially  (Benson et al., 1999) Cornelissen et al., 2013 the amygdala, with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex becoming relatively more active and orbitomedial and cingulate cortex less so; a move toward normality from patterns observed before treatment (Ochsner et al., 2002;Goldapple et al., 2004;Malhi et al., 2004;Ritchey et al., 2011;H�_flich et al., 2012) and consistent with what is know of the processing of emotional stimuli (Simpson et al., 2000;Northoff et al., 2004;Lepp�_nen, 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2008).","['The dominant paradigm has been to compare levels of brain activity pre and post CBT to see what changes.', 'This approach has mainly been used in depression and has identified that changes are localized to specific frontal, cingulate, and limbic areas.', 'There is decreased activity in the limbic system, especially  (Benson et al., 1999) Cornelissen et al., 2013 the amygdala, with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex becoming relatively more active and orbitomedial and cingulate cortex less so; a move toward normality from patterns observed before treatment (Ochsner et al., 2002;Goldapple et al., 2004;Malhi et al., 2004;Ritchey et al., 2011;H�_flich et al., 2012) and consistent with what is know of the processing of emotional stimuli (Simpson et al., 2000;Northoff et al., 2004;Lepp�_nen, 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2008).', 'Pretreatment levels of cingulate activity can even predict response to CBT with some reliability (Konarski et al., 2009;Ritchey et al., 2011;Siegle et al., 2012).']",0,"['The dominant paradigm has been to compare levels of brain activity pre and post CBT to see what changes.', 'This approach has mainly been used in depression and has identified that changes are localized to specific frontal, cingulate, and limbic areas.', 'There is decreased activity in the limbic system, especially  (Benson et al., 1999) Cornelissen et al., 2013 the amygdala, with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex becoming relatively more active and orbitomedial and cingulate cortex less so; a move toward normality from patterns observed before treatment (Ochsner et al., 2002;Goldapple et al., 2004;Malhi et al., 2004;Ritchey et al., 2011;H�_flich et al., 2012) and consistent with what is know of the processing of emotional stimuli (Simpson et al., 2000;Northoff et al., 2004;Lepp�_nen, 2006;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2008).']"

While TDM is not new, the proliferation of mobile telephony, fixed Internet, and associated applications has created fresh prospects for the implementation of commuter focused TDM strategies. One recent example is Carpool Zone, an on-line carpool-matching tool deployed and managed by the TDM group at Metrolinx, the regional transportation planning agency within CanadaÕs largest metropolitan region, the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. Using data provided by Metrolinx, this paper broadens current thinking on carpool formation and use. The main hypothesis guiding this work is that the carpool formation and use process is sensitive to personal and household characteristics, space, time, travel cost, and workplace TDM policies. Results from a logistic regression analysis suggest that geographical proximity to other users; workplace TDM policies; the scheduling of work; and commuter role preference increase the odds of successfully carpooling. Importantly, findings regarding the positive influence of workplace TDM policies suggest that Internet based TDM tools will likely require critically important investment in human capital at the back-end to ensure program participation.","In the literature most authors distinguish between householdbased and non-household-based carpools which are also called internal and external carpools respectively (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010;Correia and Viegas, 2011;Ferguson, 1997a;Morency, 2007;Teal, 1987).","['In the literature most authors distinguish between householdbased and non-household-based carpools which are also called internal and external carpools respectively (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010;Correia and Viegas, 2011;Ferguson, 1997a;Morency, 2007;Teal, 1987).', 'This distinction is relevant for two reasons.', 'First, members of the same household have their trip origin in common; as a result, no time is lost for picking up a passenger.', 'Second, the level of trust is high between members of the same household and this is considered to be important in the formation of carpool clubs.', 'Therefore, Correia and Viegas (2011) classify relations between carpool members on the basis of the level of trust which is assumed to be higher between members of the same household than between (in decreasing order of trust) friends, colleagues and unrelated persons.']",0,"['In the literature most authors distinguish between householdbased and non-household-based carpools which are also called internal and external carpools respectively (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010;Correia and Viegas, 2011;Ferguson, 1997a;Morency, 2007;Teal, 1987).']"

In theory, these systems could lead to great reductions in the use of private vehicles; however, in practice they have obtained limited success for two main reasons: the psychological barriers associated with riding with strangers and poor schedule flexibility. To overcome some of the limitations of the traditional schemes, we proposed studying a carpooling club model with two main new features: establishing a base trust level for carpoolers to find compatible matches for traditional groups and at the same time allowing to search for a ride in an alternative group when the pool member has a trip schedule different from the usual one. A web-based survey was developed for the Lisbon Metropolitan Region (Portugal), including a Stated Preference experiment, to test the concept and confirm previous knowledge on these systems' determinants. It was found through a binary logit Discrete Choice Model calibration that carpooling is still attached with lower income strata and that saving money is still an important reason for participating in it. The club itself does not show promise introducing more flexibility in these systems; however, it should provide a way for persons to interact and trust each other at least to the level of working colleagues.Carpooling Commuter trips Discrete Choice Modeling Stated Preference surveys Transport Demand Management Urban transport","In the literature most authors distinguish between householdbased and non-household-based carpools which are also called internal and external carpools respectively (Buliung et al., 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG and Viegas, 2011;Ferguson, 1997a;Morency, 2007;Teal, 1987).","['In the literature most authors distinguish between householdbased and non-household-based carpools which are also called internal and external carpools respectively (Buliung et al., 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG and Viegas, 2011;Ferguson, 1997a;Morency, 2007;Teal, 1987).', 'This distinction is relevant for two reasons.', 'First, members of the same household have their trip origin in common; as a result, no time is lost for picking up a passenger.', 'Second, the level of trust is high between members of the same household and this is considered to be important in the formation of carpool clubs.', 'Therefore, Correia and Viegas (2011) classify relations between carpool members on the basis of the level of trust which is assumed to be higher between members of the same household than between (in decreasing order of trust) friends, colleagues and unrelated persons.']",0,"['In the literature most authors distinguish between householdbased and non-household-based carpools which are also called internal and external carpools respectively (Buliung et al., 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG and Viegas, 2011;Ferguson, 1997a;Morency, 2007;Teal, 1987).']"

Copyright (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.Recent years have seen a huge rise in the levels of car ownership. The numbers of journeys made and kilometers traveled by car are increasing. Increased road transport affects health in a number of ways, including road traffic accidents, air and noise pollution, psychological well being and health related accessibility issues. A further consequence of the growth in the number of cars is traffic congestion. This paper examines employee's perceptions of their modal choice during the journey to work, and addresses what factors influence modal choice, and whether people can be moved out of their cars to other more sustainable forms of transport. The results of surveys of the commuting habits of employees at two United Kingdom companies are presented and compared with other relevant studies. Ninety-seven and 88% of staff at the respective companies travel to work by car. While only 2 and 7% of respondents cycled to work, real potential for cycling was identified, given improvements in the cycling infrastructure. Similarly, while only 0 and 3% currently use public transport for the journey to work, improved services could see a significant modal shift. Overall, there seemed to be genuine willingness to move out of the car for the journey to work, with one of the main barriers being a perception that the alternatives are not viable. Additionally, it appears that many people live too far from the workplace to cycle or use public transport.Peer reviewe","However, the majority of workers do not carpool, the advantages of carpooling are most of the time not strong enough to entice commuters to give up the comfort of driving alone (Comsis Corporation, 1993;Hwang and Giuliano, 1990;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001;Tsao and Lin, 1999).","['A particular set of carpooling determinants are the (dis)incentives present in mobility management schemes which aim to increase the popularity of carpooling.', 'The rationale behind the promotion of carpooling is that every carpooling employee implies one car less on the road.', 'The quoted benefits of carpooling are selfevident: driving costs may be shared (drivers may get compensation, because passengers pay a part of the commuting cost and still enjoy the comfort of a car), and commuters are not dependent on schedules and/or public transport networks.', 'However, the majority of workers do not carpool, the advantages of carpooling are most of the time not strong enough to entice commuters to give up the comfort of driving alone (Comsis Corporation, 1993;Hwang and Giuliano, 1990;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001;Tsao and Lin, 1999).', 'Therefore, a variety of instruments are used to promote carpooling.']",5,"['However, the majority of workers do not carpool, the advantages of carpooling are most of the time not strong enough to entice commuters to give up the comfort of driving alone (Comsis Corporation, 1993;Hwang and Giuliano, 1990;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2001;Tsao and Lin, 1999).']"

In particular, they can be used for computing the so-called reactive trajectories corresponding to direct transitions from one metastable state to another. The algorithm is based on successive selection-mutation steps performed on the system in a controlled way. It has two intrinsic parameters, the number of particles/trajectories and the reaction coordinate used for discriminating good or bad trajectories. We investigate first the convergence in law of the algorithm as a function of the timestep for several simple stochastic models. Second, we consider the average duration of reactive trajectories for which no theoretical predictions exist. The most important aspect of this work concerns some systems with two degrees of freedom. They are studied in details as a function of the reaction coordinate in the asymptotic regime where the number of trajectories goes to infinity. We show that during phase transitions, the statistics of the algorithm deviate significatively from known theoretical results when using non-optimal reaction coordinates. In this case, the variance of the algorithm is peaking at the transition and the convergence of the algorithm can be much slower than the usual expected central limit behavior. The duration of trajectories is affected as well. Moreover, reactive trajectories do not correspond to the most probable ones. Such behavior disappears when using the optimal reaction coordinate called committor as predicted by the theory. We finally investigate a three-state Markov chain which reproduces this phenomenon and show logarithmic convergence of the trajectory durations.Comment: 23 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in the Journal of   Computational physics.

This paper studies the potential of carpooling among unrelated partners (i.e., inter-household carpooling) for demand reduction during peak commute hours. Basic questions about this potential include the following. Can the current population density, origin-destination distribution, tolerable pick-up and drop-off delays, departure time distribution, and the tolerance for deviation from preferred departure time support a sizable carpooling population that can make a significant contribution to traffic demand reduction? Could the proportion of long trips that are likely candidates for carpooling (e.g., those long trips with same O-D) be so small that no significant traffic demand reduction could be expected from carpooling?The potential depends on many factors, some of which are more amenable to quantification than others. Our approach to assessing the potential is to separate such quantifiable factors from the rest, and then, based on these quantifiable factors, identify likely upper bounds for the potential. This paper focuses on a simplified urban sprawl in which the densities of workers and jobs are uniform over an infinitely large flat geographical area. For our numerical study, we use the job and worker data of the city of Los Angeles to approximate the worker/job density. An entropy optimization model that is equivalent to the gravity model is used for trip distribution.

Reported travel times are usually rounded in multiples of five minutes. This calls for special statistical techniques. Ignoring the phenomenon of rounding leads to biased estimation results for shorter distances. Rather surprisingly, the distance as the crow flies and the network distance appear to be slightly better proxies of the reported travel time compared with the shortest network travel time as indicated by the route planner. We conclude that where actual driving times are missing in commuting research the other three indicators mentioned may be used as proxies, but that the following problems may emerge: actual travel times may be considerably higher than network times generated by route planners, and the average speed of trips increases considerably with distance, implying an overestimate of travel time for long distance commuters. The only personal feature that contributes significantly to variations in reported travel times is gender: women appear to drive at lower average speeds according to our data. As indicated in the paper this may be explained by the differences in the car types of male and female drivers (females drive older and smaller cars) as well as higher numbers of stops/trip chaining among women. A concise analysis is carried out for carpoolers. Car-pooling leads to an increase in travel time of some 17% compared with solo drivers covering the same distance.

But transportation policy makers have been rather ambivalent, if not indifferent, about carpool. Unlike cities in highly motorized societies, little is known about carpooling behavior in emerging economies such as China. This paper provides an initial discussion of carpooling in China by exploring a series of questions. What are the current practice and issues of carpool in Chinese cities? How do carpools in China compare with those in the motorized Western cities? Can carpools help Chinese cities mitigate the negative impacts of rapid motorization? Are foreign policies such as High-Occupancy-Vehicle (HOV) lanes transferable to China? Acknowledging the social benefits of voluntary carpooling, this paper argues: (1) bus lanes may be a better choice than HOV lanes when converting general motor vehicle lanes; (2) policies subsidizing carpoolers cannot be justified on either efficiency or equity grounds because a marginal carpooler is more likely transitioning from a transit user or non-motorized traveler than from a driver.

It is perceived to be a viable alternative to classical modes of transportation, and receives a great deal of political support from transport planners. However, not much objective information is available on ridesharing behaviors. We use travel survey data to study the evolution of the ridesharing market in an urban area. Our study is based on data from four large-scale OD surveys conducted in the Greater Montreal Area (1987, 1993, 1998 and 2003).In the latest survey conducted in Montreal, car passengers were asked to identify the driver who gave them the opportunity to travel in this way. Their answers were classified according to the type of driver; for instance, a member of their household, a neighbor or a co-worker. We use this information to calibrate a model matching car passengers and car drivers belonging to the same household. This will be referred to as IHHR (intra-household ridesharing).Preliminary results reveal that approximately 70% of all trips made by car passengers are the result of IHHR. Furthermore, around 15% of those trips are questionable, in that they were exclusively generated for another individual's purposes, consequently generating an additional trip for the journey back home. Moreover, this percentage increased over time. Objective data regarding ridesharing and its evolution in an urban area will undoubtedly help decision makers gain a clearer profile of this means of travel and help to realign attitudes on the issue.","In the literature most authors distinguish between householdbased and non-household-based carpools which are also called internal and external carpools respectively (Buliung et al., 2010;Correia and Viegas, 2011;Ferguson, 1997a;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007;Teal, 1987).","['In the literature most authors distinguish between householdbased and non-household-based carpools which are also called internal and external carpools respectively (Buliung et al., 2010;Correia and Viegas, 2011;Ferguson, 1997a;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007;Teal, 1987).', 'This distinction is relevant for two reasons.', 'First, members of the same household have their trip origin in common; as a result, no time is lost for picking up a passenger.', 'Second, the level of trust is high between members of the same household and this is considered to be important in the formation of carpool clubs.', 'Therefore, Correia and Viegas (2011) classify relations between carpool members on the basis of the level of trust which is assumed to be higher between members of the same household than between (in decreasing order of trust) friends, colleagues and unrelated persons.']",5,"['In the literature most authors distinguish between householdbased and non-household-based carpools which are also called internal and external carpools respectively (Buliung et al., 2010;Correia and Viegas, 2011;Ferguson, 1997a;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2007;Teal, 1987).', 'This distinction is relevant for two reasons.', 'First, members of the same household have their trip origin in common; as a result, no time is lost for picking up a passenger.', 'Second, the level of trust is high between members of the same household and this is considered to be important in the formation of carpool clubs.', 'Therefore, Correia and Viegas (2011) classify relations between carpool members on the basis of the level of trust which is assumed to be higher between members of the same household than between (in decreasing order of trust) friends, colleagues and unrelated persons.']"

However, there has been a debate about whether the schemes reduce traffic. Research published in 1998 for the UK Government considered eight case studies and was interpreted by some as providing reassurance that park and ride can have traffic-reduction benefits. The present paper offers a new approach to the appraisal of the same eight park and ride schemes, separating the analysis into urban and extra-urban components. The urban-area analysis considers the net result of intercepting cars on the edge of urban areas and running additional dedicated bus services from the car parks. The finding is that traffic was avoided in seven out of eight cases. The analysis of the extra-urban effects of park and ride considers three sources of traffic increase: motorists that are intercepted detouring to reach sites, users switching from public transport services and motorists making additional trips. All are found to be important phenomena, with the total additional traffic generated outside the urban area being greater than that avoided within the urban area in every case study.

In transport scheme appraisal, savings in travel time typically represent a substantial proportion of the benefits of a scheme--benefits used to justify its often enormous financial costs. Such benefits are founded on the assumption that travel time is unproductive, wasted time in-between 'real' activities and which should be minimised. Travel demand analysis treats travel time and activity time as separate, albeit acknowledging an interdependency. The paper challenges these approaches by exploring how travel time can be, and is, being used 'productively' as activity time, and what enhancements to time use might be emerging in the 'information age'. Such undermining of the division between activities and travelling, and between activity time and travel time, may have major implications for future levels of mobility, for the modal distribution of travel, for the validity of current transport appraisal methodology and for the analysis of travelling within the information age. These issues are considered","These sustainable mobility policies are called mobility management or travel/transportation demand management (TDM) to stress that the focus is not on infrastructure supply but on managing the de-mand-side, i.e. using the transport system in the most optimal way to fulfil our lifestyle needs (Fr�_ndberg and Vilhelmson, 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG and Urry, 2005).","['Carpooling is one of the many travel alternatives promoted by transport policies to reduce the amount of vehicles on the road.', 'It was promoted during World War II to deal with oil and rubber shortages and during the oil crisis of the 1970s (Ferguson, 1997b(Ferguson, , 2000Gilbert and Perl, 2008).', 'More recently, carpooling was also advocated during the 2008 Olympics in Beijing as a response to driving restrictions (Wang, 2011).', 'Nowadays, carpooling is promoted by mobility management policies to put more emphasis on the issue of sustainable transport.', 'The main targets here are a reduction of transport-related pollution (PM 10 , NO x , and CO 2 ), noise nuisance reduction and a decrease of congestion levels.', 'These sustainable mobility policies are called mobility management or travel/transportation demand management (TDM) to stress that the focus is not on infrastructure supply but on managing the de-mand-side, i.e. using the transport system in the most optimal way to fulfil our lifestyle needs (Fr�_ndberg and Vilhelmson, 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG and Urry, 2005).']",3,"['These sustainable mobility policies are called mobility management or travel/transportation demand management (TDM) to stress that the focus is not on infrastructure supply but on managing the de-mand-side, i.e. using the transport system in the most optimal way to fulfil our lifestyle needs (Fr�_ndberg and Vilhelmson, 2010;#AUTHOR_TAG and Urry, 2005).']"

Dieleman"", ""Martin Dijst""]","The effect of decentralization of land uses on travel behavior remains an unresolved issue in the academic literature. Some US researchers argue that a tendency towards polycentrism is associated with decreasing commute times and distances. Others have, however, suggested and shown the opposite commute times and distances tend to be longer in polycentric than in monocentric urban areas. Using this controversy as a starting point, we analyse how monocentric and polycentric urban structures affect commuting in the Netherlands with data from the 1998 National Travel Survey. Four kinds of urban systems are distinguished: one monocentric and three polycentric systems. In contrast to most previous work, we use multilevel regression analysis to take adequate account of the effects of individual and household attributes. The results indicate that urban structure influences most dimensions of commuting considered here. Yet, individual and household level variables are more important determinants than characteristics of the residential and workplace environment. Gender, household type and their interaction effects remain important determinants of commute behavior in the Netherlands; particularly women in two-earner households commute less than average. Education and income are both positively related to the amount of commuting. Further, the effects of mono- and polycentrism on commuting are more complicated than the literature makes us believe. When individual and household level factors are taken account of, polycentrism does not always result in more efficient commute patterns than monocentric urban structures: in most polycentric urban areas commute distances and times are longer than in monocentric ones. Only when polycentric regions consist of several relatively independent and self-contained development nodes are commute distances shorter than elsewhere. Commute times are in that case comparable to those in monocentric urban areas. The impact of urban structure disappears when commute time is related to the time spent on work activities; the ratio between commute time and work duration is not much affected by the type of urban system in which workers reside. The fact that commute times and distances are not lower in polycentric urban areas may be attributed to the specific situation in the Netherlands: strong spatial planning policies may have obstructed the relocation of employment and housing in close proximity of each other. However, the longer commute in most policentric regions may also indicate that workers and their households not always behave as urban economic theory predicts. In any case, the results show that it is necessary to distinguish several types of polycentric systems instead of merely using a dichotomy of monocentric and polycentric in the analysis of commuting.","Furthermore, standard regression analysis ignores the grouping of data and this can cause underestimated standard errors of regression coefficients (Goldstein, 1995;Hox, 2002;Maas and Hox, 2004;Rasbash et al., 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2004).","['Multilevel modelling has the advantage of getting a better understanding and more clear interpretation of the effects of higher levels (by estimating and reporting random effects).', 'Furthermore, standard regression analysis ignores the grouping of data and this can cause underestimated standard errors of regression coefficients (Goldstein, 1995;Hox, 2002;Maas and Hox, 2004;Rasbash et al., 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2004).', 'The main disadvan- tage is that models become more complex.', 'As a consequence, diagnostics can be more complicated as well.', 'The comparison of different models is often used to evaluate a model.', 'In what follows, we will refer to the so-called empty model (model A), i.e. a model with a multilevel structure (an extra error term) but without any independent variables.', 'The empty model is then compared with the full model (model B), i.e. the multilevel model with the full set of independent variables.']",0,"['Multilevel modelling has the advantage of getting a better understanding and more clear interpretation of the effects of higher levels (by estimating and reporting random effects).', 'Furthermore, standard regression analysis ignores the grouping of data and this can cause underestimated standard errors of regression coefficients (Goldstein, 1995;Hox, 2002;Maas and Hox, 2004;Rasbash et al., 2005;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2004).']"

Usually, results are controlled for socio-economic differences and sometimes socio-psychological differences among respondents. However, these studies do not mention why after all a relationship should exist between travel behaviour and spatial, socio-economic and personality characteristics. Answering this query involves combining and linking theories stemming from transport geography (e.g. time geography, activity-based approach) and social psychology (e.g. Theory of Planned Behaviour, Theory of Repeated Behaviour). Using key-variables from these theories, this paper aims to develop a conceptual model for travel behaviour. Comparable to customary theories in transport geography, this conceptual model considers travel behaviour as derived from locational behaviour and activity behaviour. But the conceptual model adds concepts such as 'lifestyle', 'perceptions', 'attitudes' and 'preferences' which indirectly influence travel behaviour.","Standard mode choice research takes the individual or the household as the unit of observation since individual and household characteristics determine the choice process (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010).","['Despite the policy focus on employers, commuting research traditionally focuses on individual commuters or on aggregated spatial units (e.g.', 'municipalities).', 'Standard mode choice research takes the individual or the household as the unit of observation since individual and household characteristics determine the choice process (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010).', 'The advantage of aggregating individuals in geographical areas on the other hand, is that the effects at higher geographical scales are understood.', 'Indeed, one commuter does not cause a traffic jam; it is the concentration of commuters in particular places and at particular times of the day that can be considered as the main causes of congestion and pollution.', 'We acknowledge the merits of both the individual and the area-wide perspectives.', 'However, we argue that a workplace perspective might enrich transport research for a number of reasons.', 'First, employers are used as intermediaries in mobility management strategies and the set of available carpool incentives differs between workplaces.', 'Second, workplaces are physical locations with specific characteristics, even within a particular geographical area considerable differences in accessibility levels may exist between workplaces.', 'Third, the workplace is more than a physical environment; it is also a social environment.', 'Accordingly, what people at your workplace think and do (the subjective norm, corporate culture) influences your travel behaviour (Bonham and Koth, 2010;Heinen et al., 2011;McDonald, 2007;Van Acker et al., 2011).']",0,"['Despite the policy focus on employers, commuting research traditionally focuses on individual commuters or on aggregated spatial units (e.g.', 'municipalities).', 'Standard mode choice research takes the individual or the household as the unit of observation since individual and household characteristics determine the choice process (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010).', 'The advantage of aggregating individuals in geographical areas on the other hand, is that the effects at higher geographical scales are understood.', 'Indeed, one commuter does not cause a traffic jam; it is the concentration of commuters in particular places and at particular times of the day that can be considered as the main causes of congestion and pollution.', 'We acknowledge the merits of both the individual and the area-wide perspectives.', 'However, we argue that a workplace perspective might enrich transport research for a number of reasons.']"

Recently, within the debate on residential self-selection, attention has also been paid to the importance of subjective influences such as the individual's perception of the built environment and his/her residential attitudes and preferences, resulting in models that take account of both the objective and subjective characteristics of the built environment. However, self-selection might occur on other points than residential location as well. Expanding the analysis to also include both objective and subjective characteristics at other model levels (i.e., not only stage of life characteristics but also personal lifestyles; not only car availability but also travel attitudes, not only modal choice but also mode specific attitudes) is the purpose of this paper. To this end, a modal choice model for leisure trips is developed using data on personal lifestyles and attitudes, collected via an Internet survey, and estimated using a path model consisting of a set of simultaneously estimated equations between observed variables. While controlling for subjective lifestyles and attitudes, the effects of the built environment and car availability on modal choice can more correctly be determined and thus insights into self-selection mechanisms can be gained. Moreover, we compared the results of a model with and without these subjective influences. The results show that subjective characteristics at various model levels are important decisive factors of modal choices for leisure travel","Accordingly, what people at your workplace think and do (the subjective norm, corporate culture) influences your travel behaviour (Bonham and Koth, 2010;Heinen et al., 2011;McDonald, 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).","['Despite the policy focus on employers, commuting research traditionally focuses on individual commuters or on aggregated spatial units (e.g.', 'municipalities).', 'Standard mode choice research takes the individual or the household as the unit of observation since individual and household characteristics determine the choice process (Van Acker et al., 2010).', 'The advantage of aggregating individuals in geographical areas on the other hand, is that the effects at higher geographical scales are understood.', 'Indeed, one commuter does not cause a traffic jam; it is the concentration of commuters in particular places and at particular times of the day that can be considered as the main causes of congestion and pollution.', 'We acknowledge the merits of both the individual and the area-wide perspectives.', 'However, we argue that a workplace perspective might enrich transport research for a number of reasons.', 'First, employers are used as intermediaries in mobility management strategies and the set of available carpool incentives differs between workplaces.', 'Second, workplaces are physical locations with specific characteristics, even within a particular geographical area considerable differences in accessibility levels may exist between workplaces.', 'Third, the workplace is more than a physical environment; it is also a social environment.', 'Accordingly, what people at your workplace think and do (the subjective norm, corporate culture) influences your travel behaviour (Bonham and Koth, 2010;Heinen et al., 2011;McDonald, 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).']",0,"['Accordingly, what people at your workplace think and do (the subjective norm, corporate culture) influences your travel behaviour (Bonham and Koth, 2010;Heinen et al., 2011;McDonald, 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011).']"

With this, major attention goes towards the role of employers in the commuting behaviour of their employees. Indeed, employers can encourage a more sustainable commuting by the promotion of alternative modes, like public transport, carpooling and/or cycling, by the designation of an Employee Transport Coordinator, through their location policy, and/or by adapting work schedules and the organisation of telework. An overview of these measures is followed by an analysis of the Belgian situation. The Belgian 2005 questionnaire Home-to-Work-Travel (HTWT) enables us to make an inventory of mobility management in Belgium. The database HTWT contains information on 7460 worksites. Besides having data on modal split, work regimes and accessibility problems, 38 different mobility management measures are checked in the questionnaire. Given that we assume a relationship between accessibility problems and sustainable commuting measures both are incorporated in one analysis. Binary exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is used to make a classification and to obtain a better insight in the structure of the variables. However, no strong link between accessibility problems on the one hand and sustainable commuting measures on the other hand could be detected. Despite the absence of this link, a classification of mobility management measures and accessibility problems has been made. This indicates that employers regularly choose to implement a set of related sustainable commuting measures.","This database is the result of a mandatory questionnaire about the home to work displacements and the mobility management measures at large workplaces in Belgium (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010).","['The aim of the present paper is to analyse carpooling in Belgium using a workplace perspective.', 'Therefore, we need data that is national in scope and that provides data on workplace-related factors like work schedules and mobility management measures.', 'As the main source of data we employ the Belgian database home-towork-travel (HTWT) 2005.', 'This database is the result of a mandatory questionnaire about the home to work displacements and the mobility management measures at large workplaces in Belgium (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010).', 'A large workplace is defined as a site containing at least 30 employees of a company with at least 100 employees.', 'The database HTWT 2005 contains 7460 work sites with at least 30 employees which employ 1,342,119 employees in total.', 'In addition, we will also use data stemming from the Belgian 2001 Census for illustrative and comparative purposes (Verhetsel et al., 2009).', 'This Census does not contain information on mobility management initiatives at workplaces and other organisational characteristics.', 'Nevertheless, it helps to complete the picture of carpooling in Belgium.']",2,"['This database is the result of a mandatory questionnaire about the home to work displacements and the mobility management measures at large workplaces in Belgium (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010).']"

For comparison, the energy consumption per person kilometre for rail is 0.14 kWh/pkm while that for a car is 0.48 kWh/pkm (Boussauw and Witlox 2009), and electric trains have no direct emissions of air pollutants like PM 10 and NO x. Modal shift policies often target the daily commute since home to work travel is concentrated in the congested peak hours and commuters' travel behaviour is more regular. This regular character seems to fit well with the scheduled nature of rail, and the central location of railway stations fits with the relative concentration of jobs in congested cities (Riguelle, Thomas, and Verhetsel 2007). Furthermore, both cities and public transport are predominant in the sustainable mobility paradigm (Banister 2008). Therefore, the location of jobs in city-regions and the link with rail use, are at the core of our analysis.

While recognizing these advances, the paper calls attention to the problems of disaggregate models in terms of data requirements, computing time and stochastic variation and shows that in the light of new challenges cities are facing environmental problems, such as energy scarcity and climate change, not further refinement but more focus on basic needs and constraints is needed to make the models useful for the planning practice. As a possible solution to the macroÐmicro debate, it calls for a theory of multi_level models according to which for each planning task there is an appropriate level of conceptual, spatial and temporal resolution.

We assume that when the commute journey intensifies, either in terms of distance or frequency, attitudes toward cycling become more positive. Factor analysis reveals three underlying attitudinal factors toward cycling to work: awareness, direct trip-based benefits and safety. The decision to cycle is influenced by the factor ""direct trip-based benefit"" at all distances, whereas the ""awareness"" is influential only over long distances. The decision to cycle every day is again affected by the ""direct benefit"" factor. The factors ""safety"" and ""awareness"" are important over shorter distances. Having a cycling habit increases the likelihood of cycling and a higher frequency of cycling. The perceived opinion of others only affects the mode choice over short distances suggesting indicates mode choice on longer commutes is based on one's own attitudes.

Empirical research has shown an inconsistent picture on the impact of density. In particular, it is unclear whether it is the density or the variables that go long with density that affect people's travel behavior. Many existing studies on density neglect confounding factors, for example, residential self-selection, generalized travel cost, accessibility, and access to transit stations. In addition, most still use a single trip as their observation unit, even though trip chaining is well recognized. The goal of this paper is to assess the role of density in affecting mode choice decisions in home-based work tours, while controlling for confounding factors. Using the dataset collected in the New York Metropolitan Region, we estimated a simultaneous two-equation system comprising two mutually interacting dependent variables: car ownership and the propensity to use auto. The results confirm the role of density after controlling for the confounding factors; in particular, employment density at work exerts more influence than residential density at home. The study also demonstrates the importance of using tour as the analysis unit in mode choice decisions. The study advances the field by analyzing the role of the built environment on home-based work tours.

Mediating institutions connect the private lives of individuals with public policy concerns by communicating societal norms to members and providing social contexts that encourage a commitment to these norms. Despite the potential importance of employers as mediating institutions for public policy, little scholarly attention has been devoted to employer mediation behavior. Accordingly, this study examines two research questions. What factors influence an employer's willingness to mediate policy problems? And how effective are employers as mediating institutions? The mediation behaviors of interest relate to employer efforts to mitigate traffic congestion and air quality problems by enabling employee ""commute options,"" which are alternatives to single-occupancy vehicle commuting to work. Drawing on theories of organization behavior, the study hypothesizes that self-interest, organizational control, and association membership will affect willingness to provide commute options. The study also hypothesizes that employers providing commute options will have lower percentages of employees that drive to work alone. Both sets of hypotheses are supported by statistical analyses of data from a cross-sectional mail survey of metropolitan Atlanta organizations.","Employers have a privileged relationship with their employees and are therefore regularly used as intermediaries between government and individual travellers (#AUTHOR_TAG and Guensler, 2005;Ferguson, 1997bFerguson, , 2007.","['Usually, commuting traffic is a major topic in mobility management schemes since most people commute to already congested urban areas during the peak travel period.', 'The involvement of employers in transport policy is a logical consequence of this focus on commuting.', 'Employers have a privileged relationship with their employees and are therefore regularly used as intermediaries between government and individual travellers (#AUTHOR_TAG and Guensler, 2005;Ferguson, 1997bFerguson, , 2007.', 'Furthermore, employers are also more efficiently organised to implement mobility management measures such as parking restrictions, allowances and bicycle facilities.', 'Finally, involving the private sector also reduces the burden of transport policies on the public budget (Cairns et al., 2008;Roby, 2010;Rye, 2002).']",5,"['Employers have a privileged relationship with their employees and are therefore regularly used as intermediaries between government and individual travellers (#AUTHOR_TAG and Guensler, 2005;Ferguson, 1997bFerguson, , 2007.']"

In transport policy discussions, these are now widely described as ÔsoftÕ factor interventions or Ôsmarter choiceÕ measures or Ômobility managementÕ tools. In 2004, the UK Department for Transport commissioned a major study to examine whether large_scale programmes of these measures could potentially deliver substantial cuts in car use. The purpose of this article is to clarify the approach taken in the study, the types of evidence reviewed and the overall conclusions reached. In summary, the results suggested that, within approximately ten years, smarter choice measures have the potential to reduce national traffic levels by about 11%, with reductions of up to 21% of peak period urban traffic. Moreover, they represent relatively good value for money, with schemes potentially generating benefit:cost ratios which are in excess of 10:1.

It is found that mode choice appears to be of little impact for the energy performance of home-to-work travel on the scale of the Flanders region. At the other hand, proximity between home and work locations is paramount.  Residential density plays a part in this, although much depends on the specific situation.

Maas"", ""Joop J. Hox""]","A multilevel problem concerns a population with a hierarchical structure. A sample from such a population can be described as a multistage sample. First, a sample of higher level units is drawn (e.g. schools or organizations), and next a sample of the sub-units from the available units (e.g. pupils in schools or employees in organizations). In such samples, the individual observations are in general not completely independent. Multilevel analysis software accounts for this dependence and in recent years these programs have been widely accepted. Two problems that occur in the practice of multilevel modeling will be discussed. The first problem is the choice of the sample sizes at the different levels. What are sufficient sample sizes for accurate estimation? The second problem is the normality assumption of the level-2 error distribution. When one wants to conduct tests of significance, the errors need to be normally distributed. What happens when this is not the case? In this paper, simulation studies are used to answer both questions. With respect to the first question, the results show that a small sample size at level two (meaning a sample of 50 or less) leads to biased estimates of the second-level standard errors. The answer to the second question is that only the standard errors for the random effects at the second level are highly inaccurate if the distributional assumptions concerning the level-2 errors are not fulfilled. Robust standard errors turn out to be more reliable than the asymptotic standard errors based on maximum likelihood.","Furthermore, standard regression analysis ignores the grouping of data and this can cause underestimated standard errors of regression coefficients (Goldstein, 1995;Hox, 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG and Hox, 2004;Rasbash et al., 2005;Schwanen et al., 2004).","['Multilevel modelling has the advantage of getting a better understanding and more clear interpretation of the effects of higher levels (by estimating and reporting random effects).', 'Furthermore, standard regression analysis ignores the grouping of data and this can cause underestimated standard errors of regression coefficients (Goldstein, 1995;Hox, 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG and Hox, 2004;Rasbash et al., 2005;Schwanen et al., 2004).', 'The main disadvan- tage is that models become more complex.', 'As a consequence, diagnostics can be more complicated as well.', 'The comparison of different models is often used to evaluate a model.', 'In what follows, we will refer to the so-called empty model (model A), i.e. a model with a multilevel structure (an extra error term) but without any independent variables.', 'The empty model is then compared with the full model (model B), i.e. the multilevel model with the full set of independent variables.']",0,"['Multilevel modelling has the advantage of getting a better understanding and more clear interpretation of the effects of higher levels (by estimating and reporting random effects).', 'Furthermore, standard regression analysis ignores the grouping of data and this can cause underestimated standard errors of regression coefficients (Goldstein, 1995;Hox, 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG and Hox, 2004;Rasbash et al., 2005;Schwanen et al., 2004).']"

A major finding was that southern timber producers are net beneficiaries of regulation, at least in the short run. Unfortunately, this conclusion is based on a flawed procedure for calculating the producer welfare impact of a supply shift. In addition, the study mismeasured the supply and demand shifts. In this study we present a method for applied welfare analysis that avoids these problems, yet is theoretically consistent and easier to apply. Applying the simplified method to WCH's analysis, we find that environmental regulations impose a significant cost on the South's forestry sector (timber producers and consumers alike).

While the diversification of diets away from the traditional dominance of rice with rising incomes is expected and observed, current food consumption patterns are showing signs of convergence towards a Western diet. Globalization and the consequent global interconnectedness of the urban middle class, is the driving force behind the convergence of diets. The rapid spread of global supermarket chains and fast food restaurants are reinforcing the above trends. The following six key stylised facts characterize the changes in food demand in Asia: i) reduced per capita consumption of rice; ii) increased consumption per capita of wheat and wheat based products; iii) increased diversity in the food groups consumed; iv) rise in high protein and energy dense diets; v) increased consumption of temperate zone products; and vi) the rising popularity of convenience food and beverages. As the demand profile changes with economic growth and globalisation, so the supply systems must adapt to accommodate this change. Asian agriculture is on an irreversible path leading away from its traditional preoccupation with cereal crop production, especially rice, towards a production system that is becoming increasingly commercialized and diversified. This paper addresses the opportunities and constraints in the transformation process. It discusses the prospects for the small farmer to share in the benefits from greater market integration. Finally, the paper identifies an agenda for science, technology and policy that will allow for a smoother transition to the emerging production and food supply system.","The Westernization of diets in Asian economies (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007), along with rapid income growth, are also highlighted as important drivers (Enders and Holt 2012).","['If prices increase due to increased demand this has an entirely different implication than if they rise because of reduced supply.', 'Demand growth will lead to increased production, to the extent that producers are able to respond to higher prices.', 'If prices increase due to supply contractions, it could be a reflection of unsolved problems in the production process, a substitution of production away from food to other commodities, or a decline in productivity growth.', 'Different causes of price changes have vastly different implications for food security and welfare both for producers and consumers.', 'The task of identifying the factors behind price changes in food commodity markets is complex.', 'Many of these factors are difficult, if not impossible, to measure appropriately.', 'Thus, the simple question of ""why do prices change?""', 'usually requires elaborate investigation.', 'Trostle (2008) identifies several demand and supply factors that simultaneously contributed to a recent increase in food prices.', 'Gilbert (2010) emphasizes the impact of common factors on the general level of agricultural food prices.', 'He argues that investments in index-based agricultural futures markets were a major cause of the broad rise in food prices in [2007][2008].', 'The fundamental driver of such index investments is the belief that rapid economic growth in China will increase demand for commodities in general.', 'The Westernization of diets in Asian economies (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007), along with rapid income growth, are also highlighted as important drivers (Enders and Holt 2012).', 'Another driver is the diversion of food crops into the production of biofuels, which is generally considered to influence long-run agricultural price levels (Serra and Zilberman 2013).', 'The recent price booms have also lead to increased interest in the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis of continuous long-term declines in primary commodity prices (Balagtas and Holt 2009;Harvey and Kellard 2010;Enders and Holt 2012).', ""Results yield mixed evidence of the hypothesis' efficacy: Harvey and Kellard (2010) for instance, find longrun decline in the price of only 11 of 25 major commodities.""]",4,"['The Westernization of diets in Asian economies (#AUTHOR_TAG 2007), along with rapid income growth, are also highlighted as important drivers (Enders and Holt 2012).']"

Consumers also seem to be gaining greater awareness of the value and need for sustainable energy practices, particularly amid growing public concerns over greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Yet even with adequate knowledge of how to save energy and a professed desire to do so, many consumers still fail to take noticeable steps towards energy efficiency and conservation. There is often a sizeable discrepancy between peoples' self-reported knowledge, values, attitudes and intentions, and their observable behaviour--examples include the well-known 'knowledge-action gap' and 'value-action gap'. But neither is household energy consumption driven primarily by financial incentives and the rational pursuit of material interests. In fact, people sometimes respond in unexpected and undesirable ways to rewards and sanctions intended to shift consumers' cost-benefit calculus in favour of sustainable behaviours. Why is this so? Why is household energy consumption and conservation difficult to predict from either core values or material interests? By drawing on critical insights from behavioural economics and psychology, we illuminate the key cognitive biases and motivational factors that may explain why energy-related behaviour so often fails to align with either the personal values or material interests of consumers. Understanding these psychological phenomena can make household and community responses to public policy interventions less surprising, and in parallel, can help us design more cost-effective and mass-scalable behavioural solutions to encourage renewable and sustainable energy use among consumers","The empirical literature on demand growth has relied mainly on using smooth operators such as a time trend (#AUTHOR_TAG and Muellbauer 1980), or the use of relatively smooth indicators such as spending on advertisements or media coverage when investigating demand shifts over time (e.g.","['The empirical literature on demand growth has relied mainly on using smooth operators such as a time trend (#AUTHOR_TAG and Muellbauer 1980), or the use of relatively smooth indicators such as spending on advertisements or media coverage when investigating demand shifts over time (e.g.', 'Kinnucan et al., 1997).', 'This approach is commonly applied in empirical work on salmon demand (Bj�_rndal et al. 1992;Asche 1996;Xie et al. 2009;Xie and Myrland 2011).', 'In this article, I adopt a parsimonious approach to measuring demand shifts; yearly changes in price and quantities are decomposed between regional supply and demand shifts, and the relative impact from each supply and demand shift on price is determined.']",2,"['The empirical literature on demand growth has relied mainly on using smooth operators such as a time trend (#AUTHOR_TAG and Muellbauer 1980), or the use of relatively smooth indicators such as spending on advertisements or media coverage when investigating demand shifts over time (e.g.']"

This process is well documented at the producer level in Asche (1997), Tveteras (2002), and Anderson (2002). A central argument for the successful growth in aquaculture has been increased control of the production process that allows market-oriented production and sales. However, with the exception of Zidac, Kinnucan, and Hatch (1992), little attention has been given to how these potential advantages have been exploited in the supply chain. Still, for increased aquaculture production productivity, growth in the supply chain is as equally important as productivity growth at the production level. A consumer only cares that a product has become less expensive, not at which level in the supply chain the productivity improvement caused the lower price to take place. A main reason why productivity growth in the supply chain has received little attention is lack of data downstream. It is, in general, not too difficult o access data to conduct studies at the production level, the trade level, and even the retail level. However, it is very hard to match the data at one level in the supply chain with data at a different level. Furthermore, it is also very difficult o acquire data on other variables that influence intermediary firms' behavior.

Tacon"", ""Frank Asche"", ""Ronald W. Hardy"", ""Santosh Lall""]","In this article, the definition of sustainability is discussed, particularly in relation to the use of marine feed resources. The current review gives an overview of the development of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture and how it has evolved due to changes in legal and management framework conditions. Atlantic salmon production is characterized with high utilization of nutrients, a high yield of production, and a large demand for rendered by-products. All of these factors compare favorably to production of most terrestrial farm animals. Historically, salmon feed has contained fishmeal and fish oil as the primary protein and fat source. Rising demand for feed ingredients has not increased pressure on forage fish resources. Rather, there has been an increased use of plant protein and fat sources. Increased utilization of plant ingredients may not be as sustainable as often claimed. Provided that marine harvest is carried out within legal frames, harvesting the marine ecosystem is a sustainable operation, and at present, the only significant source of long chain n-3 fatty acids.

Arguments that such tasks are mediated by abstract knowledge (e.g., A. S.

Because of a number of methodological concerns, the small magnitudes of artificial grammar learning effects generally are difficult to interpret. Possible solutions are offered here.

Item similarity did not affect grammaticality judgments when similar and nonsimilar test items were balanced for the frequency with which bigrams and trigrams (chunks) that appeared in the training set also appeared in the test items. Amnesic patients performed like normal subjects. The results suggest that concrete information about letter chunks can influence grammaticality judgments and that this information is acquired implicitly. The similarity of whole test items to training items does not appear to affect grammaticality judgments. In tasks of artificial grammar learning, subjects see a series of letter strings generated by a finite-state rule system. Although subjects are not initially told about the existence of the rules governing formation of the letter strings, they are nevertheless able on a subsequent test to classify new letter strings as either grammatical or nongrammatical. One view of artificial grammar learning holds that the learning is implicit (nondeclarative) and that subjects acquire the ability to classify without explicit (declarative) access to their knowledge. The learning is based on subjects &apos; ability to detect regularities in the stimulus environment without being aware of them (see Reber, 1989,1992, for reviews; also Mathews et al, 1989).

Within syntactic theory, there is a mechanism that will undermine thematic interpretation in accordance with this hypothesis, and it bears a principled relation to agreement difficulties Ss experience in acceptability judgment experiments but does not affect their abilities to judge, for example, deformed passives.","English passives are ""harder"" with regard to a number of variables (Caplan & Waters, 1999;Drai & Grodzinsky, 2006;Druks, 2002;Grodzinsky, 2000;#AUTHOR_TAG, Fromkin, & Cornell, 1993) as they contain more words, more functional morphemes, have a non-canonical word order and, in some theories, involve a transformation from canonical order (or ""movement"" of constituents) .","[""WR's comprehension profile showed a dissociation which is the reverse of the predominantly reported pattern of good performance on actives and poor performance on passives, and poses a substantial challenge to conventional explanations for syntactic disorder (Druks & Marshall, 1995."", 'English passives are ""harder"" with regard to a number of variables (Caplan & Waters, 1999;Drai & Grodzinsky, 2006;Druks, 2002;Grodzinsky, 2000;#AUTHOR_TAG, Fromkin, & Cornell, 1993) as they contain more words, more functional morphemes, have a non-canonical word order and, in some theories, involve a transformation from canonical order (or ""movement"" of constituents) .']",0,"[""WR's comprehension profile showed a dissociation which is the reverse of the predominantly reported pattern of good performance on actives and poor performance on passives, and poses a substantial challenge to conventional explanations for syntactic disorder (Druks & Marshall, 1995."", 'English passives are ""harder"" with regard to a number of variables (Caplan & Waters, 1999;Drai & Grodzinsky, 2006;Druks, 2002;Grodzinsky, 2000;#AUTHOR_TAG, Fromkin, & Cornell, 1993) as they contain more words, more functional morphemes, have a non-canonical word order and, in some theories, involve a transformation from canonical order (or ""movement"" of constituents) .']"

Fitch and Hauser (F&amp;H; 2004) approached this question by assessing the ability of different species to learn 2 grammars, (AB)n and AnBn. AnBn was taken to indicate a phrase structure grammar, eliciting a center-embedded pattern. (AB)n indicates a grammar whose strings entail only local relations between the categories of constituents. F&amp;H's data suggest that humans, but not tamarin monkeys, learn an AnBn grammar, whereas both learn a simpler (AB)n grammar (Fitch &amp; Hauser, 2004). In their experiments, the A constituents were syllables pronounced by a female voice, whereas the B constituents were syllables pronounced by a male voice. This study proposes that what characterizes the AnBn exemplars is the distributional regularities of the syllables pronounced by either a male or a female rather than the underlying, more abstract patterns. This article replicates F&amp;H's data and reports new controls using either categories similar to those in F&amp;H or less salient ones. This article shows that distributional regularities explain the data better than grammar learning. Indeed, when familiarized with AnBn exemplars, participants failed to discriminate A3B2 and A2B3 from AnBn items, missing the crucial feature that the number of As must equal the number of Bs. Therefore, contrary to F&amp;H, this study concludes that no syntactic rules implementing embedded nonadjacent dependencies were learned in these experiments. The difference between human linguistic abilities and the putative precursors in monkeys deserves further exploration","There is strong evidence, including from self-reports after the experiment, that participants who learn non-configurational properties do so by counting and comparing the number of stimuli of each class, and participants without syntactic disorder more consistently attend to configurational (order) than nonconfigurational (counting) structure (de Vries, Monaghan, Knecht, & Zwitserlood, 2008;#AUTHOR_TAG, Azadpour, & Mehler, 2008;Perruchet & Rey, 2005;.","['A n B n sequences have linear configurational properties: All stimuli of one class precede the stimuli of the other class, and the first class is A.

Brooks""]","In this paper we examine the development of passive participles in the spontaneous speech of seven English speaking children. We argue that the grammatical properties which distinguish passive participles as a category emerge gradually and are learned as motivated properties of a complex, polysemous construction. The data reveals a regular progression from early adjectival uses to true verbal passives, in which the participle itself denotes a dynamic event. This process follows a consistent pattern, whereby children gradually extend the use of participles to equivocal contexts that are compatible with either a stative or an eventive reading. All seven children regularly use participles in equivocal contexts before they begin to master true verbal passives. This development is analyzed as an instance of constructional grounding, a process whereby certain uses of a relatively simple source construction provide the basis for children's initial hypotheses about a more diAcult target construction. More generally, the gradual progression from adjectival to verbal passives suggests how syntactic categories and grammatical constructions can be learned gradually on the basis of earlier, simpler structures.","The verb phrase morphology (be+TNS V+PastP, e.g., is pushed), which in child development first emerges as the state passive (e.g., it's broken), appears to be grounded in stative use and biased towards assigning its subject an inactive role (Brooks & Tomasello, 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG, Johnson, & Brooks, 2001;Riches, 2013).","['However, functional morphemes in passives contain strong cues for interpretation.', ""The verb phrase morphology (be+TNS V+PastP, e.g., is pushed), which in child development first emerges as the state passive (e.g., it's broken), appears to be grounded in stative use and biased towards assigning its subject an inactive role (Brooks & Tomasello, 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG, Johnson, & Brooks, 2001;Riches, 2013).""]",0,"['However, functional morphemes in passives contain strong cues for interpretation.', ""The verb phrase morphology (be+TNS V+PastP, e.g., is pushed), which in child development first emerges as the state passive (e.g., it's broken), appears to be grounded in stative use and biased towards assigning its subject an inactive role (Brooks & Tomasello, 1999;#AUTHOR_TAG, Johnson, & Brooks, 2001;Riches, 2013).""]"

The Procedural Deficit Hypothesis (PDH) proposes that SLI is largely explained by abnormal functioning of the frontal-basal ganglia circuits that support procedural memory. It has also been suggested that declarative memory can compensate for at least some of the problems observed in individuals with SLI. A number of studies have used Serial Reaction Time (SRT) tasks to investigate procedural learning in SLI. In this report, results from eight studies that collectively examined 186 participants with SLI and 203 typically-developing peers were submitted to a meta-analysis. The average mean effect size was .328 (CI95: .071, .584) and was significant. This suggests SLI is associated with impairments of procedural learning as measured by the SRT task. Differences among individual study effect sizes, examined with meta-regression, indicated that smaller effect sizes were found in studies with older participants, and in studies that had a larger number of trials on the SRT task.

Natural and artificial language processing in a man with primary progressive aphasia",Vitor Zimmerer,What artificial grammar learning reveals about the neurobiology of syntax,"[""Karl Magnus Petersson"", ""Christian Forkstam"", ""Martin Ingvar""]","In this paper we examine the neurobiological correlates of syntax, the processing of structured sequences, by comparing FMRI results on artificial and natural language syntax. We discuss these and similar findings in the context of formal language and computability theory. We used a simple right-linear unification grammar in an implicit artificial grammar learning paradigm in 32 healthy Dutch university students (natural language FMRI data were already acquired for these participants). We predicted that artificial syntax processing would engage the left inferior frontal region (BA 44/45) and that this activation would overlap with syntax-related variability observed in the natural language experiment. The main findings of this study show that the left inferior frontal region centered on BA 44/45 is active during artificial syntax processing of well-formed (grammatical) sequence independent of local subsequence familiarity. The same region is engaged to a greater extent when a syntactic violation is present and structural unification becomes difficult or impossible. The effects related to artificial syntax in the left inferior frontal region (BA 44/45) were essentially identical when we masked these with activity related to natural syntax in the same subjects. Finally, the medial temporal lobe was deactivated during this operation, consistent with the view that implicit processing does not rely on declarative memory mechanisms that engage the medial temporal lobe. In the context of recent FMRI findings, we raise the question whether Broca's region (or subregions) is specifically related to syntactic movement operations or the processing of hierarchically nested non-adjacent dependencies in the discussion section. We conclude that this is not the case.

We examined comprehension and production of canonical and noncanonical sentence structures and production of tensed and nontensed verb forms using constrained tasks in experiments 1 and 2, using the Northwestern Assessment of Verbs and Sentences (NAVS [57]) and the Northwestern Assessment of Verb Inflection (NAVI, Thompson and Lee, experimental version) test batteries, respectively. Experiment 3 examined free narrative samples, focusing on syntactic and morphosyntactic measures, i.e. production of grammatical sentences, noun to verb ratio, open-class to closed-class word production ratio, and the production of correctly inflected verbs. Results indicate that the two agrammatic groups (i.e., PPA-G and StrAg) pattern alike on syntactic and morphosyntactic measures, showing more impaired noncanonical compared to canonical sentence comprehension and production and greater difficulties producing tensed compared to nontensed verb forms. Their spontaneous speech also contained significantly fewer grammatical sentences and correctly inflected verbs, and they produced a greater proportion of nouns compared to verbs, than healthy speakers. In contrast, PPA-L and StrAn individuals did not display these deficits, and performed significantly better than the agrammatic groups on these measures. The findings suggest that agrammatism, whether induced by degenerative disease or stroke, is associated with characteristic deficits in syntactic and morphosyntactic processing. We therefore recommend that linguistically sophisticated tests and narrative analysis procedures be used to systematically evaluate the linguistic ability of individuals with PPA, contributing to our understanding of the language impairments of different PPA variants.","Written sentence comprehension and production displayed more gradual decline (Table 1), consistent with #AUTHOR_TAG et al.'s (2013) observation that some people with logopenic PPA become syntactically impaired over time, and an unusual comprehension pattern emerged (chance level performance on actives, ceiling performance on passives (Table 2)).","['WR was 62 years old at the time of the experiment.', 'Four years previously, he was diagnosed with logopenic PPA (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011).', 'Non-language cognition was unimpaired during the course of the investigation reported here.', 'His Performance IQ (Wechsler, 1999) was 119.', 'Structural MR scanning revealed bilateral atrophy to fronto-temporal perisylvian regions (Fig. 1), which was greatest in the left superior temporal gyrus.', 'With disease progression, he displayed a decline in auditory comprehension.', 'In the third year post-diagnosis and consistent with bilateral temporal lobe atrophy, WR was diagnosed with cortical deafness.', 'Although his performance in auditory comprehension tasks was at or near chance, written word comprehension was only mildly impaired and remained stable over time.', ""Written sentence comprehension and production displayed more gradual decline (Table 1), consistent with #AUTHOR_TAG et al.'s (2013) observation that some people with logopenic PPA become syntactically impaired over time, and an unusual comprehension pattern emerged (chance level performance on actives, ceiling performance on passives (Table 2))."", 'Table 1.', ""WR's performance on written and spoken tests of lexical and grammatical processing in years 1, 2 and 3 post-diagnosis (years 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 post symptom onset)."", 'Chance level is 25% for word-picture matching tasks and 50% for all other tasks.']",0,"[""Written sentence comprehension and production displayed more gradual decline (Table 1), consistent with #AUTHOR_TAG et al.'s (2013) observation that some people with logopenic PPA become syntactically impaired over time, and an unusual comprehension pattern emerged (chance level performance on actives, ceiling performance on passives (Table 2)).""]"

Natural and artificial language processing in a man with primary progressive aphasia",Vitor Zimmerer,The neurology of syntax: Language use without Broca's area,"[""Yosef Grodzinsky""]","A new view of the functional role of the left anterior cortex in language use is proposed. The experimental record indicates that most human linguistic abilities are not localized in this region. In particular, most of syntax (long thought to be there) is not located in Broca's area and its vicinity (operculum, insula, and subjacent white matter). This cerebral region, implicated in Broca's aphasia, does have a role in syntactic processing, but a highly specific one: It is the neural home to receptive mechanisms involved in the computation of the relation between transformationally moved phrasal constituents and their extraction sites (in line with the Trace-Deletion Hypothesis). It is also involved in the construction of higher parts of the syntactic tree in speech production. By contrast, basic combinatorial capacities necessary for language processing--for example, structure-building operations, lexical insertion--are not supported by the neural tissue of this cerebral region, nor is lexical or combinatorial semantics. The dense body of empirical evidence supporting this restrictive view comes mainly from several angles on lesion studies of syntax in agrammatic Broca's aphasia. Five empirical arguments are presented: experiments in sentence comprehension, cross linguistic considerations (where aphasia findings from several language types are pooled and scrutinized comparatively), grammaticality and plausibility judgments, real-time processing of complex sentences, and rehabilitation. Also discussed are recent results from functional neuroimaging and from structured observations on speech production of Broca's aphasics. Syntactic abilities are nonetheless distinct from other cognitive skills and are represented entirely and exclusively in the left cerebral hemisphere. Although more widespread in the left hemisphere than previously thought, they are clearly distinct from other human combinatorial and intellectual abilities. The neurological record (based on functional imaging, split-brain and right-hemisphere-damaged patients, as well as patients suffering from a breakdown of mathematical skills) indicates that language is a distinct, modularly organized neurological entity. Combinatorial aspects of the language faculty reside in the human left cerebral hemisphere, but only the transformational component (or algorithms that implement it in use) is located in and around Broca's area.","English passives are ""harder"" with regard to a number of variables (Caplan & Waters, 1999;Drai & #AUTHOR_TAG, 2006;Druks, 2002;Grodzinsky, 2000;Mauner, Fromkin, & Cornell, 1993) as they contain more words, more functional morphemes, have a non-canonical word order and, in some theories, involve a transformation from canonical order (or ""movement"" of constituents) .","[""WR's comprehension profile showed a dissociation which is the reverse of the predominantly reported pattern of good performance on actives and poor performance on passives, and poses a substantial challenge to conventional explanations for syntactic disorder (Druks & Marshall, 1995."", 'English passives are ""harder"" with regard to a number of variables (Caplan & Waters, 1999;Drai & #AUTHOR_TAG, 2006;Druks, 2002;Grodzinsky, 2000;Mauner, Fromkin, & Cornell, 1993) as they contain more words, more functional morphemes, have a non-canonical word order and, in some theories, involve a transformation from canonical order (or ""movement"" of constituents) .']",0,"[""WR's comprehension profile showed a dissociation which is the reverse of the predominantly reported pattern of good performance on actives and poor performance on passives, and poses a substantial challenge to conventional explanations for syntactic disorder (Druks & Marshall, 1995."", 'English passives are ""harder"" with regard to a number of variables (Caplan & Waters, 1999;Drai & #AUTHOR_TAG, 2006;Druks, 2002;Grodzinsky, 2000;Mauner, Fromkin, & Cornell, 1993) as they contain more words, more functional morphemes, have a non-canonical word order and, in some theories, involve a transformation from canonical order (or ""movement"" of constituents) .']"

Various forms of evidence are considered: the relationship between individual differences in working memory and individual differences in the efficiency of syntactic processing; the effect of concurrent verbal memory load on syntactic processing; and syntactic processing in patients with poor short term memory, poor working memory, or aphasia.

Conway"", ""David B. Pisoni""]","Fundamental learning abilities related to the implicit encoding of sequential structure have been postulated to underlie language acquisition and processing. However, there is very little direct evidence to date supporting such a link between implicit statistical learning and language. In three experiments using novel methods of assessing implicit learning and language abilities, we show that sensitivity to sequential structure - as measured by improvements to immediate memory span for structurally-consistent input sequences - is significantly correlated with the ability to use knowledge of word predictability to aid speech perception under degraded listening conditions. Importantly, the association remained even after controlling for participant performance on other cognitive tasks, including short-term and working memory, intelligence, attention and inhibition, and vocabulary knowledge. Thus, the evidence suggests that implicit learning abilities are essential for acquiring long-term knowledge of the sequential structure of language - i.e., knowledge of word predictability - and that individual differences on such abilities impact speech perception in everyday situations. These findings provide a new theoretical rationale linking basic learning phenomena to specific aspects of spoken language processing in adults, and may furthermore indicate new fruitful directions for investigating both typical and atypical language development.Copyright 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Several recent studies have reported learning of hierarchical embeddings in artificial grammar learning (AGL) tasks, and described the functional specificity of Broca's area for processing such structures. In two experiments, we investigated whether alternative strategies can explain the learning success in these studies. We trained participants on hierarchical sequences, and found no evidence for the learning of hierarchical embeddings in test situations identical to those from other studies in the literature. Instead, participants appeared to solve the task by exploiting surface distinctions between legal and illegal sequences, and applying strategies such as counting or repetition detection. We suggest alternative interpretations for the observed activation of Broca's area, in terms of the application of calculation rules or of a differential role of working memory. We claim that the learnability of hierarchical embeddings in AGL tasks remains to be demonstrated.","There is strong evidence, including from self-reports after the experiment, that participants who learn non-configurational properties do so by counting and comparing the number of stimuli of each class, and participants without syntactic disorder more consistently attend to configurational (order) than nonconfigurational (counting) structure (#AUTHOR_TAG, Monaghan, Knecht, & Zwitserlood, 2008;Hochmann, Azadpour, & Mehler, 2008;Perruchet & Rey, 2005;.","['A n B n sequences have linear configurational properties: All stimuli of one class precede the stimuli of the other class, and the first class is A.

While a certain amount of variability is indeed evident in the data, our quantitative analyses reveal a highly robust selective impairment pattern for the group: the patients' ability to analyze syntactic movement is severely compromised, in line with the Trace-Deletion Hypothesis. Further analyses suggest that patients' performance on no-movement sentence types exhibits less variation than on sentences that contain movement.

The first part of the review discusses three topics. The first is the relationship between verb/noun deficits and diagnostic categories such as Broca's aphasia and anomia. The second discusses studies that assume that verb/noun differences are lexical and evaluate the evidence concerning the level(s) on current models of lexical processing at which verb/noun differences might occur. The third deals with studies that argue that verb/noun differences derive from semantic differences and are reducible to imageability effects or to loss of functional or perceptual features.

Specific attention is paid to patterns of preserved and impaired understanding of reversible actives and passives. We note that no prior account will allow for the existence of patients who show better comprehension of passives than actives. In three experiments, we compare and contrast the performance of two patients whose syntactic comprehension ability is in complementary distribution. The first patient (M.H.) performs well on simple actives, active questions, and active existentials, but is below chance on their corresponding passives. The second patient (B.M.) is at chance on simple actives, active questions and active existentials while scoring significantly above chance on their respective passives. We interpret both patterns of response in terms of the distinction drawn by Case theory between structural and inherent Case. The first patient's grammar cannot assign either structural or inherent Case and she must accordingly apply a non-linguistic linear strategy to assign thematic roles in all sentences. The second patient (B.M.) has a specific impairment of structural Case; he can accordingly not interpret actives (where Case is assigned configurationally) but can interpret passives (where Case is assigned lexically).","WR's comprehension profile showed a dissociation which is the reverse of the predominantly reported pattern of good performance on actives and poor performance on passives, and poses a substantial challenge to conventional explanations for syntactic disorder (#AUTHOR_TAG & Marshall, 1995.","[""WR's comprehension profile showed a dissociation which is the reverse of the predominantly reported pattern of good performance on actives and poor performance on passives, and poses a substantial challenge to conventional explanations for syntactic disorder (#AUTHOR_TAG & Marshall, 1995."", 'English passives are ""harder"" with regard to a number of variables (Caplan & Waters, 1999;Drai & Grodzinsky, 2006;Druks, 2002;Grodzinsky, 2000;Mauner, Fromkin, & Cornell, 1993) as they contain more words, more functional morphemes, have a non-canonical word order and, in some theories, involve a transformation from canonical order (or ""movement"" of constituents) .']",0,"[""WR's comprehension profile showed a dissociation which is the reverse of the predominantly reported pattern of good performance on actives and poor performance on passives, and poses a substantial challenge to conventional explanations for syntactic disorder (#AUTHOR_TAG & Marshall, 1995.""]"

Natural and artificial language processing in a man with primary progressive aphasia",Vitor Zimmerer,The misinterpretation of noncanonical sentences,"[""F Ferreira""]","Research on language comprehension has focused on the resolution of syntactic ambiguities, and most studies have employed garden-path sentences to determine the system's preferences and to assess its use of nonsyntactic sources information. A topic that has been neglected is how syntactically challenging but essentially unambiguous sentences are processed, including passives and object-clefts--sentences that require thematic roles to be assigned in an atypical order. The three experiments described here tested the idea that sentences are processed both algorithmically and heuristically. Sentences were presented aurally and the participants' task was to identify the thematic roles in the sentence (e.g., Who was the do-er?). The first experiment demonstrates that passives are frequently and systematically misinterpreted, especially when they express implausible ideas. The second shows that the surface frequency of a syntactic form does not determine ease of processing, as active sentences and subject-clefts were comprehended equally easily despite the rareness of the latter type. The third experiment compares the processing of subject- and object-clefts, and the results show that they are similar to actives and passives, respectively, again despite the infrequent occurrence in English of any type of cleft. The results of the three experiments suggest that a comprehensive theory of language comprehension must assume that simple processing heuristics are used during processing in addition to (and perhaps sometimes instead of) syntactic algorithms. Moreover, the experiments support the idea that language processing is often based on shallow processing, yielding a merely ""good enough"" rather than a detailed linguistic representation of an utterance's meaning.","All active sentences used in testing WR's comprehension could have been interpreted correctly using the common bias that the agent appears first (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2003).","[""Active sentences, and in particular those used for testing WR's syntactic comprehension, lack cues of this type."", 'Functional morphology, if present, was not reliable as a cue for determining semantic roles.', 'For instance, the NP in NP be+TNS V+ing can have many roles such as agent (The man is pushing the elephant), patient (The dress is selling), experiencer (The woman is watching the game) or instrument (The computer is enabling her to speak).', 'Interpretation of English actives relies more on word order.', ""All active sentences used in testing WR's comprehension could have been interpreted correctly using the common bias that the agent appears first (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2003).""]",0,"[""All active sentences used in testing WR's comprehension could have been interpreted correctly using the common bias that the agent appears first (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2003).""]"

When these conflict, landmarks can either reset estimates of self-motion or be integrated with them [6-9]. We asked how humans combine these information sources and whether children, who use both from a young age [10-12], combine them as adults do. Participants attempted to return an object to its original place in an arena when given either visual landmarks only, nonvisual self-motion information only, or both. Adults, but not 4- to 5-year-olds or 7- to 8-year-olds, reduced their response variance when both information sources were available. In an additional ""conflict"" condition that measured relative reliance on landmarks and self-motion, we predicted behavior under two models: integration (weighted averaging) of the cues and alternation between them. Adults' behavior was predicted by integration, in which the cues were weighted nearly optimally to reduce variance, whereas children's behavior was predicted by alternation. These results suggest that development of individual spatial-representational systems precedes development of the capacity to combine these within a common reference frame.

According to these models, detection responses are especially fast when signals are presented on two channels at the same time because the system can detect a signal in either of two ways. Such models predict a testable relation among reaction time distributions for conditions in which a single signal is presented as compared with a condition in which two signals are presented, and this prediction is tested in two tasks. A bimodal detection task required a simple speeded response to either a visual or an auditory signal. A letter search task required a choice response depending on whether or not a two-letter display included the signal letter ÒA.Ó Data from both tasks are inconsistent with the prediction. When two signals are presented, responses are faster than separate-activation models can explain.

This is partially because of debates concerning the appropriate analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in response to multisensory phenomena. Using event-related fMRI, we observed that simple auditory stimuli (noise bursts) activated primary visual cortices and that simple visual stimuli (checkerboards) activated primary auditory cortices, indicative of multisensory convergence. Moreover, analyses of blood oxygen level-dependent response dynamics revealed facilitation of hemodynamic response peak latencies and slopes for multisensory auditory-visual stimuli versus either unisensory condition, indicative of multisensory interactions within primary sensory cortices. Neural processing at the lowest cortical levels can be modulated by interactions between the senses. Temporal information in fMRI data can reveal these modulations and overcome analytic and interpretational challenges of more traditional procedures. In addition to providing an essential translational link with animal models, these results suggest that longstanding notions of cortical organization need to be revised to include multisensory interactions as an inherent component of functional brain organization.","The decisions in our study may also (or alternatively) have depended on other cortical mechanisms (Molholm et al., 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007;Noppeney et al., 2010).","['These results can reconcile those from previous studies in which infants showed speed gains exceeding race models in a localisation task (Neil et al., 2006), but children aged below 7 or 10-12 years did not do so reliably in a central task where the stimulus was always at the same location, straight ahead (Barutchu et al., 2009;Barutchu et al., 2010;Brandwein et al., 2011).', 'In the present left/right localisation task, we saw evidence for pooling of signals from 4 years.', 'One might expect that the additional need to make correct spatial decisions would work against finding the greatest speed improvements.', 'However, it may be that the need to localise the stimulus in space on every trial tapped into multisensory decision mechanisms dedicated to spatial localisation.', 'A wellknown substrate for this kind of localisation is the superior colliculus (SC; Wallace et al., 1996;Wallace & Stein, 1997;Stein & Meredith, 1993).', 'Multisensory integration in superior colliculus develops with postnatal sensory experience, which seems to be learnt via the cortico-SC projection (Stein et al., 2009).', 'The decisions in our study may also (or alternatively) have depended on other cortical mechanisms (Molholm et al., 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007;Noppeney et al., 2010).', ""A study with adults directly comparing saccadic, directed manual and simple manual responses found violations of Miller's bound in all three cases (Hughes et al., 1994)."", 'The present developmental results from a directed manual task, together with previous data from spatial orienting (Neil et al., 2006) and simple manual tasks (Barutchu et al., 2009;Barutchu et al., 2010;Brandwein et al., 2011), suggest that pooling of auditory and visual signals may develop much earlier for spatial localisation of signals than for simple detection of their onset.', 'A follow-up study comparing simple responses and localisation directly should test this interpretation.']",3,"['The decisions in our study may also (or alternatively) have depended on other cortical mechanisms (Molholm et al., 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007;Noppeney et al., 2010).']"

Combining fMRI and psychophysics in humans, we investigated how the brain accumulates sensory evidence about a visual source in the context of congruent or conflicting auditory information. In a visual selective attention paradigm, subjects (12 females, 7 males) categorized video clips while ignoring concurrent congruent or incongruent soundtracks. Visual and auditory information were reliable or unreliable. Our behavioral data accorded with accumulator models of perceptual decision making, where sensory information is integrated over time until a criterion amount of information is obtained. Behaviorally, subjects exhibited audiovisual incongruency effects that increased with the variance of the visual and the reliability of the interfering auditory input. At the neural level, only the left inferior frontal sulcus (IFS) showed an ""audiovisual-accumulator"" profile consistent with the observed reaction time pattern. By contrast, responses in the right fusiform were amplified by incongruent auditory input regardless of sensory reliability. Dynamic causal modeling showed that these incongruency effects were mediated via connections from auditory cortex. Further, while the fusiform interacted with IFS in an excitatory recurrent loop that was strengthened for unreliable task-relevant visual input, the IFS did not amplify and even inhibited superior temporal activations for unreliable auditory input. To form decisions that guide behavioral responses, the IFS may accumulate audiovisual evidence by dynamically weighting its connectivity to auditory and visual regions according to sensory reliability and decisional relevance.","The decisions in our study may also (or alternatively) have depended on other cortical mechanisms (Molholm et al., 2002;Martuzzi et al., 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010).","['These results can reconcile those from previous studies in which infants showed speed gains exceeding race models in a localisation task (Neil et al., 2006), but children aged below 7 or 10-12 years did not do so reliably in a central task where the stimulus was always at the same location, straight ahead (Barutchu et al., 2009;Barutchu et al., 2010;Brandwein et al., 2011).', 'In the present left/right localisation task, we saw evidence for pooling of signals from 4 years.', 'One might expect that the additional need to make correct spatial decisions would work against finding the greatest speed improvements.', 'However, it may be that the need to localise the stimulus in space on every trial tapped into multisensory decision mechanisms dedicated to spatial localisation.', 'A wellknown substrate for this kind of localisation is the superior colliculus (SC; Wallace et al., 1996;Wallace & Stein, 1997;Stein & Meredith, 1993).', 'Multisensory integration in superior colliculus develops with postnatal sensory experience, which seems to be learnt via the cortico-SC projection (Stein et al., 2009).', 'The decisions in our study may also (or alternatively) have depended on other cortical mechanisms (Molholm et al., 2002;Martuzzi et al., 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010).', ""A study with adults directly comparing saccadic, directed manual and simple manual responses found violations of Miller's bound in all three cases (Hughes et al., 1994)."", 'The present developmental results from a directed manual task, together with previous data from spatial orienting (Neil et al., 2006) and simple manual tasks (Barutchu et al., 2009;Barutchu et al., 2010;Brandwein et al., 2011), suggest that pooling of auditory and visual signals may develop much earlier for spatial localisation of signals than for simple detection of their onset.', 'A follow-up study comparing simple responses and localisation directly should test this interpretation.']",3,"['The decisions in our study may also (or alternatively) have depended on other cortical mechanisms (Molholm et al., 2002;Martuzzi et al., 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010).']"

When does this capacity for crossmodal integration develop? Here, we show that prior to 8 years of age, integration of visual and haptic spatial information is far from optimal, with either vision or touch dominating totally, even in conditions in which the dominant sense is far less precise than the other (assessed by discrimination thresholds). For size discrimination, haptic information dominates in determining both perceived size and discrimination thresholds, whereas for orientation discrimination, vision dominates. By 8-10 years, the integration becomes statistically optimal, like adults.

Dabholkar""]","The formation of synaptic contacts in human cerebral cortex was compared in two cortical regions: auditory cortex (Heschl's gyrus) and prefrontal cortex (middle frontal gyrus). Synapse formation in both cortical regions begins in the fetus, before conceptual age 27 weeks. Synaptic density increases more rapidly in auditory cortex, where the maximum is reached near postnatal age 3 months. Maximum synaptic density in middle frontal gyrus is not reached until after age 15 months. Synaptogenesis occurs concurrently with dendritic and axonal growth and with myelination of the subcortical white matter. A phase of net synapse elimination occurs late in childhood, earlier in auditory cortex, where it has ended by age 12 years, than in prefrontal cortex, where it extends to midadolescence. Synaptogenesis and synapse elimination in humans appear to be heterochronous in different cortical regions and, in that respect, appears to differ from the rhesus monkey, where they are concurrent. In other respects, including overproduction of synaptic contacts in infancy, persistence of high levels of synaptic density to late childhood or adolescence, the absolute values of maximum and adult synaptic density, and layer specific differences, findings in the human resemble those in rhesus monkeys.","Age improvements in pooling efficiency would be consistent with childhood brain changes including synaptic pruning and myelination (#AUTHOR_TAG & Dabholkar, 1997;Giedd et al., 1999), although their dependence on development of specific cortical or subcortical networks remains to be investigated.","['Our analysis suggests that the increasing departure with age from the predictions of either race model is explained by the increasing efficiency of pooling.', 'At younger ages, pooling is less efficient (more potentially useful information is lost), so the benefits of pooling are smaller, and behaviour departs less dramatically from the range that can be predicted by parallel-channels models.', 'Age improvements in pooling efficiency would be consistent with childhood brain changes including synaptic pruning and myelination (#AUTHOR_TAG & Dabholkar, 1997;Giedd et al., 1999), although their dependence on development of specific cortical or subcortical networks remains to be investigated.', ""Another factor contributing to stronger departures from the model in older child and adult observers' data may be the somewhat greater number of data points for adults, or a more consistent (less noisy) patterns of responding."", 'Finally, although instructed to respond as quickly as possible, all observers presumably used some speed/accuracy trade-off, the setting of which is unknown and could have varied across age groups.']",3,"['Age improvements in pooling efficiency would be consistent with childhood brain changes including synaptic pruning and myelination (#AUTHOR_TAG & Dabholkar, 1997;Giedd et al., 1999), although their dependence on development of specific cortical or subcortical networks remains to be investigated.']"

Such models make a prediction about the probability distributions of reaction times that is often called the race model inequality, and it is often of interest to test this prediction.

The authors argue that people in countries where government institutions are weak and patron-client relationships strong are more likely to support a corrupt leader from whom they expect to receive tangible benefits. Using a cross-national analysis of citizens in 14 countries, the authors find statistical evidence consistent with the hypothesis, which also complements some of the recent works on clientelism and institutional development. This has important implications for scholars and practitioners working on accountability and good governance issues because its shows that as long as corrupt leaders can satisfy their clientelistic networks by manipulating government resources, they are likely to retain political support. This, in turn, questions the assumption that a few administrative reforms can weed out corruption in countries where formal and informal institutions provide opportunities for this phenomenon to thrive.","Welch and Hibbing (1997), Dimock and Jacobson (1995), and Peters and Welch (1980) provide similar evidence in the case of U.S. Chang et al.

In both types of interaction with the public sector, the private agents are bound to face uncertainty with respect to their disposable incomes. To analyse effects of this uncertainty, a stochastic dynamic growth model with the public sector is examined. It is shown that deterministic excessive red tape and corruption deteriorate the growth potential through income redistribution and public sector inefficiencies. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that the increase in corruption via higher uncertainty exerts adverse effects on capital accumulation, thus leading to lower growth rates.Corruption, growth, public goods, tax evasion, uncertainty","M��on and Sekkat (2005), Pellegrini and Gerlagh (2004), Mo (2001), and  #AUTHOR_TAG (1995) find that it leads to lower investment.","['There is a wide body of inter-disciplinary literature which links corruption to various social and economic ills.', 'For example, Escaleras et al.

CC508,6503095,Turkish Voter Response to Government Incompetence and Corruption Related to the 1999 Earthquakes,Ali Akarca,Corruption and Direct Foreign Investment,"[""Mohsin Habib"", ""Leon Zurawicki""]","In the last few decades, the world has witnessed an enormous growth in the volume of foreign direct investment (FDI). The global stock of FDI reached US$ 7.5 trillion in 2003 and accounted for 11% of world Gross Domestic Product, up from 7% in 1990. The sales of multinational enterprises at around US$ 19 trillion were more than double the level of world exports. Substantial FDI inflows went into transition countries. Inflows into one of the region's largest recipient, the Russian Federation, almost doubled, enabling Russia to become one of the five top FDI destinations in 2005-2006. FDI inflows in Russia have increased almost threefold from 13.6% in 2003 to 35% in 2007. In 2003, these flows were twice greater than those into China; whilst in 2007 they were six times larger. Russia's FDI inflows were also about 2.5 times greater than those of Brazil. Efficient government institutions are argued by many economists to foster FDI and growth as a result. However, the magnitude of this effect has yet to be measured. This thesis takes a Political Economy approach to explore, empirically, the potential impact of malfunctioning governmental institutions, proxied by three indices of perceived corruption, on FDI stocks accumulation/distribution within Russia over the period of 2002-2004. Using a regional data-set it concentrates on three areas relating to FDI. Firstly, it considers the significance, the size and the sign of the impact of perceived corruption on accumulation of FDI stocks within Russia. Secondly, it quantifies the impact of perceived corruption on the volume of FDI stocks simultaneously estimating the impact of the investment in public capital such as telecommunications and transportation networks on FDI in the presence of corruption. In particular, it addresses the question whether more corrupt regions in Russia are also those that could have accumulated more of FDI stocks, and investigates whether those 'more corrupt' regions would have had lower level of public capital investment. Finally, it examines whether decentralisation increases or decreases corruption and whether a larger extent of decentralisation has a positive or negative impact on FDI (stocks). The results of three studies are as follows. Firstly, along with market potential, corruption is found to be one of the key factors in explaining FDI distribution within Russia between 2002 and 2004. Secondly, corruption on average is found to be related to FDI positively suggesting that it may act as speed money: to save their time foreign direct investors might be willing to bribe the regional authorities so to move in front of the bureaucratic lines. Thirdly, although when corruption is controlled for, the impact of the latter on unobservable FDI is found to be on average positive, no association between FDI and public investment is observed with the only exception of transportation infrastructure (i.e., railway). The results might suggest therefore that it is possible that not only regions with high levels of perceived corruption attract more FDI but also that expansions in public capital investments are not accompanied by an increase of the volume of FDI (stocks) in regions with high levels of corruption. This casts some doubt on the productivity of the investment in public capital in these regions as it might be that bureaucrats may prefer to use these infrastructural projects for rent extraction. Finally, we find decentralisation to have a significant and positive impact on both FDI stock accumulation and corruption, suggesting that local governments may spend more on public goods to make the area more attractive to foreign investors but at the same time they may be interested into extracting rents from foreign investors. These results support the idea that the regulation of FDI is associated with and facilitated by a larger public sector, which distorts competition and introduces opportunities for rent-seeking by particular economic and political factors","Countries with high levels of public sector corruption are found to receive less foreign aid, by Alesina and Weder (2002), and less foreign direct investment, by  #AUTHOR_TAG and Zurawicki (2002).","['There is a wide body of inter-disciplinary literature which links corruption to various social and economic ills.', 'For example, Escaleras et al.

It starts from an endogenous growth model and extends it to account for the detrimental effects of corruption on the potentially productive components of government spending, namely military and investment spending. The resulting model is estimated on a sample of African countries and the results show, first, that the growth rate is strongly influenced by the interaction between corruption and military burden, with the interaction between corruption and government investment expenditure having a weaker effect. Second, allowing for the cyclical economic fluctuations in specific countries leaves the estimated elasticities close to those of the full sample. Third, there are significant conditioning variables that need to be taken into account, namely the form of  government, political instability and natural resource endowment. These illustrate the cross country heterogeneity when accounting for quantitative direct and indirect effects of key variables on economic growth.

Using data from three worldwide firm-level surveys, we examine the relationship between bribe payment, management time wasted with bureaucrats, and cost of capital. Contrary to the ""efficient grease"" theory, we find that firms that pay more bribes are also likely to spend more, not less, management time with bureaucrats negotiating regulations, and face higher, not lower, cost of capital.","Rose-Ackerman (1997) for example argues that corruption will always escalate to ever higher levels, and  #AUTHOR_TAG and Wei (2000) find that in economies where corruption is high and more bribes have to be paid, managers end up allocating more time to public officials and less time to productive work.","['To fight corruption, it is necessary to have institutions in place that disseminate relevant information, and voters who act on that information to hold politicians accountable.', 'Costas et al.

In the paper, through growth regression analysis, we estimate the direct and indirect effects of corruption on economic growth. The indirect transmission channels, specifically investments, trade policy, schooling, and political stability, analysed in our study prove to be significant in explaining the deleterious effect of corruption on growth rates. We find that one standard deviation increase in the corruption index is associated with a decrease in investments of 2.46 percentage points, which in turn decreases economic growth by 0.34 percent per year. The second, by importance, transmission channel is openness: a standard deviation increase in the corruption index is associated with a decrease of the openness index by 0.19, resulting in a decrease in economic growth by 0.30 percent per year. Jointly, the transmission channels explain 81 percent of the effect of corruption on growth. While combating corruption is a long-term task, an understanding of the transmission channels, through which corruption affects the economy, may suggest ways to limit corruption's negative, but indirect, effects on growth.","M��on and Sekkat (2005),  #AUTHOR_TAG and Gerlagh (2004), Mo (2001), and Mauro (1995) find that it leads to lower investment.","['There is a wide body of inter-disciplinary literature which links corruption to various social and economic ills.', 'For example, Escaleras et al.

Based upon the results of Brazil's recent anti-corruption program that randomly audits municipal expenditures of federally-transferred funds, it estimates the effect of the disclosure of local government corruption practices upon the re-election success of incumbent mayors in municipal elections. Comparing municipalities which were randomly audited before the elections with those audited after, the analysis shows that the disclosure of audit results had a significant impact on the re-election rates of mayors found to be corrupt. For a one standard deviation increase in reported corruption, the audit policy reduced the incumbent's likelihood of re-election by 25 percent. This effect is more pronounced in municipalities where radio stations are present and higher levels of corruption are identified. These findings highlight the value of information and the role of the media in reducing informational asymmetries in the political process, thus enabling voters to not only hold corrupt politicians accountable but also to reward non-corrupt politicians. *We are grateful to David Card, Ken Chay, Alain de Janvry, Seema Jayachandran, Enrico Moretti, James Robinson, Elisabeth Sadoulet, and participants of the Berkeley development lunch and workshop for helpful conversations and suggestions.

Dimock"", ""Gary C. Jacobson""]","Analysis of the 1992 American National Election Study (ANES) data indicates that the House bank scandal reduced the vote for House incumbents by approximately five percentage points. The scandal mainly affected the small subset of voters who were most offended by bank overdrafts and who did not assume that their representative had a clean record. Fortunately for members who had written bad checks, voters who knew about the transgression were least disposed to be outraged by it, while the voters most disposed to outrage were also most inclined to believe the guilty were innocent. The explanation for these curious patterns is that voters who faced the option of condemning an incumbent they otherwise appreciated or dismissing the offense as inconsequential often chose the latter course. The damage was also moderated by partisanship; voters of the incumbent's party showed a strong tendency to err in the incumbent's favor in assessing involvement in the scandal. The classical theory of cognitive dissonance readily explains both phenomena.","Welch and Hibbing (1997),  #AUTHOR_TAG and Jacobson (1995), and Peters and Welch (1980) provide similar evidence in the case of U.S. Chang et al.

We analyze one channel through which corruption hampers growth : public investment can be distorted in favor of specific types of spending for which rent-seeking is easier and better concealed. To study this distortion, we propose an optimal growth model where households vote for the composition of public spending subject to an incentive constraint reflecting individuals' choice between productive activity and rent-seeking. At equilibrium, the intensity of corruption and the structure of public investment are determined by the predatory technology and the distribution of political power. Among different regimes, the model shows a possible scenario of distortion without corruption in which there is no effective corruption yet still the possibility of corruption distorts the allocation of public investment, thus hampering growth. We test the implications of the model on a panel of countries estimating a system of equations which instrumental variables.

Nye""]","This chapter is concerned with the effects of corruption and suggests hypotheses about the costs and benefits of corruption. If corruption helps promote economic development which is generally necessary to maintain a capacity to preserve legitimacy in the face of social change, then it is beneficial for political development. Although corruption may help promote economic development, it can also hinder it or direct it in socially less desirable directions. It seems fair to assume that a society's political structures will be better able to cope with change and preserve their legitimacy if the members share a sense of community. Indeed, integration is sometimes used as one of the main scales for measuring political development. By destroying the legitimacy of political structures in the eyes of those who have power to do something about the situation, corruption can contribute to instability and possible national disintegration.","Especially if they believe that the honest challengers will not be able to deliver the same results in terms of economic development and increases in their well-being, many of them may still vote for the 1 It should be noted that some researchers, such as  #AUTHOR_TAG (1989) and Leff (1964) argue that optimal level of corruption may be non-zero.","['To fight corruption, it is necessary to have institutions in place that disseminate relevant information, and voters who act on that information to hold politicians accountable.', 'Costas et al.

At stake are the quality of care for millions of Americans and the financial well-being of individuals and employers squeezed by skyrocketing premiums--not to mention the stability of state and federal government budgets. In Redefining Health Care, internationally renowned strategy expert Michael E. Porter and innovation expert Elizabeth Olmsted Teisberg reveal the underlying- and largely overlooked--causes of the problem and provide a powerful prescription for change. The authors argue that participants in the health care system have competed to shift costs, accumulate bargaining power, and restrict services rather than create value for patients. This zero-sum competition takes place at the wrong level--among health plans, networks, and hospitals--rather than where it matters most: in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of specific health conditions.

Testable hypotheses were generated from each criticism amenable to empirical examination. Inter-rater reliability estimates were applied to observed differences between scores between community and ward patients using resampling.Five thousand one hundred eighty community inceptions and 862 admissions had HoNOS65+ ratings at referral/admission and discharge. We could find no evidence of gaming (artificially worse scores at inception and better at discharge), selection, attrition or detection bias, and ratings were consistent with diagnosis and level of service. Anticipated low levels of inter-rater reliability did not vitiate differences between levels of service.Although only hypotheses testable from within RCOM data were examined, and only 46% of eligible episodes had complete outcomes data, no evidence of the alleged biases were found.

Hayes"", ""Robert Stewart""]","Background High smoking prevalence is a major public health concern for people with mental disorders. Improved monitoring could be facilitated through electronic health record (EHR) databases. We evaluated whether EHR information held in structured fields might be usefully supplemented by open-text information. The prevalence and correlates of EHR-derived current smoking in people with severe mental illness were also investigated. Methods All cases had been referred to a secondary mental health service between 2008-2011 and received a diagnosis of schizophreniform or bipolar disorder. The study focused on those aged over 15 years who had received active care from the mental health service for at least a year (N=1,555). The 'CRIS-IE-Smoking' application used General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) natural language processing software to extract smoking status information from open-text fields. A combination of CRIS-IE-Smoking with data from structured fields was evaluated for coverage and the prevalence and demographic correlates of current smoking were analysed. Results Proportions of patients with recorded smoking status increased from 11.6% to 64.0% through supplementing structured fields with CRIS-IE-Smoking data. The prevalence of current smoking was 59.6% in these 995 cases for whom this information was available. After adjustment, younger age (below 65 years), male sex, and non-cohabiting status were associated with current smoking status. Conclusions A natural language processing application substantially improved routine EHR data on smoking status above structured fields alone and could thus be helpful in improving monitoring of this lifestyle behaviour. However, limited information on smoking status remained a challenge.","New techniques of natural language processing of electronic clinical records (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013) are now being applied to the extraction of interventions thus avoiding burdening the clinicians or service users with extra data-gathering.","['Given the fine balance in the UK between drivers of and obstacles to RCOM, we can anticipate only slow progress here.', 'Central to this are the much greater development of routine feedback of outcomes data to clinicians and in their use in clinician/service-user contacts.', 'Of the three dimensions of outcome (health status change, context and intervention) necessary for meaningful feedback usable data on the latter are almost entirely absent in most UK services.', 'New techniques of natural language processing of electronic clinical records (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013) are now being applied to the extraction of interventions thus avoiding burdening the clinicians or service users with extra data-gathering.', 'With increasing accuracy it is possible to scan digital clinical notes and letters and extract data on the use of medications and formal psychotherapeutic interventions.', 'There is also a vision that clinical change data (improvement or deterioration) itself might one day be reliably garnered directly from records without the use of questionnaires.', 'On the other hand, the misguided appetite for commissioning and purchasing healthcare outcomes themselves (�� per HoNOS point improvement) under the flag of ""value"" (Porter et al., 2006) will, if thoughtlessly indulged, almost certainly lead to the same fate for RCOM in the UK as has befallen education, in which case we will re-enter the RCOM dark ages here again.']",3,"['New techniques of natural language processing of electronic clinical records (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2013) are now being applied to the extraction of interventions thus avoiding burdening the clinicians or service users with extra data-gathering.']"

NICE Guidelines prescribe the offer of evidence-based psychological therapy, but they are not implemented, due to lack of therapists within the NHS. We therefore estimate the economic costs and benefits of providing psychological therapy to people not now in treatment. The cost to the government would be fully covered by the savings in incapacity benefits and extra taxes that result from more people being able to work. On our estimates the cost could be recovered within two years - and certainly within five. And the benefits to the whole economy are greater still. This is not because we expect the extra therapy to be targeted especially at people with problems about work. It is because the cost of the therapy is so small (PS750 in total), the recovery rates are so high (50%) and the cost of a person on IB is so large (PS750 per month).

Progress feedback to therapists improved outcomes, especially for cases at risk for a negative outcome, but direct progress feedback to clients did not. Effects were significantly enhanced by using the manual-based CST. There were no significant differences in outcome between the 1-week-delayed CST feedback and 2-week-delayed CST feedback groups; however, clients in the week-delayed CST feedback timing condition attended three less sessions, on average, than their 2-week-delayed CST feedback counterparts while maintaining similar treatment gains.

As part of the intervention, patients provide ratings of their subjective quality of life (SQOL) on eight Likert type items and their treatment satisfaction on three such items. This study explored the psychometric qualities of the outcome data generated in the DIALOG intervention to explore whether they may be used for evaluating treatment outcomes. Method Data were taken from 271 patients who received the DIALOG intervention. All patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia or a related disorder and treated in community mental health care. For SQOL and treatment satisfaction as assessed in the DIALOG intervention, we established the internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), the convergent validity of SQOL items (correlation with Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life [MANSA]) and treatment satisfaction items (correlation with Client Satisfaction Questionnaire [CSQ]), the concurrent validity (correlations with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS]) and the sensitivity to change (t-test comparing ratings of the first and last intervention). We also explored the factorial structure of the eight SQOL items. Results The internal consistency of the eight SQOL items was .71 and of the three treatment satisfaction items .57. SQOL scores were correlated with the MANSA (r = .95) and PANSS scores (general psychopathology: r = -.37, positive symptoms: r = -.27, negative symptoms: r = -.27). Treatment satisfaction scores were correlated with the CSQ (r = 0.36) and the PANSS (r = -.29, -.20, -.20). SQOL and treatment satisfaction score improved significantly over time. SQOL items loaded on two meaningful factors, one capturing health and personal safety and one reflecting other life domains. Conclusions The psychometric qualities of the SQOL scores generated in DIALOG are strong. The properties of the three treatment satisfaction items may be seen as acceptable. Although DIALOG has been designed as a therapeutic intervention, it can generate outcome data on SQOL and treatment satisfaction with acceptable psychometric qualities.</p","Priebe et al (#AUTHOR_TAG, Golden, McCabe, & Reininghaus, 2012) has reported the results of subjective quality of life items in DIALOG (see Table 1), a structured communication tool in mental health services.","['Priebe et al (#AUTHOR_TAG, Golden, McCabe, & Reininghaus, 2012) has reported the results of subjective quality of life items in DIALOG (see Table 1), a structured communication tool in mental health services.', 'Some UK services have plans to pilot these for routine use.']",0,"['Priebe et al (#AUTHOR_TAG, Golden, McCabe, & Reininghaus, 2012) has reported the results of subjective quality of life items in DIALOG (see Table 1), a structured communication tool in mental health services.', 'Some UK services have plans to pilot these for routine use.']"

Even though the use of this rating scale requires trained raters, it is commonly deployed without prior training in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability and the agreement of CGAS ratings with an expert rating, in a clinical setting with untrained raters. Five experienced clinicians rated five vignettes to provide expert ratings. These vignettes were then rated by 703 health-care professionals representing 33 Swedish CAMHS. The health-care professionals rated the vignettes significantly higher (showing better global functioning) than the expert ratings. There was a wide range between the minimum and maximum ratings. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.73, which indicates moderate inter-rater reliability.

Closely similar versions are completed by parents, teachers, and young people aged 11 or more. The validation study involved two groups of 5-15-year-olds: a community sample (N = 467) and a psychiatric clinic sample (N = 232). The two groups had markedly different distributions on the measures of perceived difficulties, impact (distress plus social impairment), and burden. Impact scores were better than symptom scores at discriminating between the community and clinic samples; discrimination based on the single ""Is there a problem?"" item was almost as good. The SDQ burden rating correlated well (r = .74) with a standardised interview rating of burden.

It has its origins in a political desire to regulate education, holding schools accountable. However, its form and nature also reflect educational and curriculum concerns and technical assessment issues. Purpose: The aim of the article is to provide a narrative account of the development and changes in NCA in England from its initiation to 2008 and to explain the reasons for these. Sources of evidence: The sources quoted are in the public domain, but in addition to academic articles, include political biographies and published official papers. Main argument and conclusions: NCA in England has evolved over 20 years, from an attempt at a criterion-referenced system based on tasks marked by the children's own teachers through to an externally marked examination system. This change reflects the political purposes of the system for accountability, and the pressure associated with this has led to growing criticism of the effects on children and their education. Nonetheless, the results provided are widely used by the public and government, and the reasons for the survival of the system lie in both its utility and the difficulty of identifying a new system which is necessarily an improvement for all the stakeholders involved.","In the 1990s the UK Department of Education became rabid about routine educational testing, eventually pushing through dramatic reforms in the teeth of professional opposition (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2009).","['It might be thought that services almost entirely funded by taxes would welcome RCOM simply on the basis of ""value"" (Porter & Teisberg, 2006) but this has only been the case in the UK in the case of the huge investment in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) described above.', 'UK government ministries are relatively independent of each other in the approach they take to the services they fund and their demand for outcomes information.', 'One ministry (e.g.', 'health) can proceed hesitantly and incoherently with RCOM whilst another (e.g.', 'education) can force a top-down outcomes system with scant consultation.', 'We, under the former, perhaps wishing for more coherent direction from above can usefully glance towards the latter.', 'In the 1990s the UK Department of Education became rabid about routine educational testing, eventually pushing through dramatic reforms in the teeth of professional opposition (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2009).', 'However the summative and evaluative functions of routine testing became dominant, including published league tables, leading some to suggest that UK state education has, to a greater or lesser extent, been replaced by schooling for test-passing.', 'Without comparison between scores at the beginning and end of a period of intervention, league tables are meaningless (William, 1992).', ""Goodhart's Law (briefly, any measure that becomes a target ceases to be a measure (Goodhart, 1981)) was also ignored so that the outcomes of education in the UK in the 21st century remain essentially unknown."", 'Despite huge investment, the possibilities of routine outcomes measurement in terms of reflective professional practice and assessment of novel teaching methods were lost.', 'Educational development in the UK continues to proceed by whim (ministerial rather than professional), when it could so much better proceed by a the sort of systematic professional approach to which we aspire in RCOM.']",4,"['In the 1990s the UK Department of Education became rabid about routine educational testing, eventually pushing through dramatic reforms in the teeth of professional opposition (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2009).']"

AIMS To assess the MHRS's acceptability, reliability and convergent validity.   METHOD A total of 172 services users and 120 staff from in-patient and community services participated. Interrater reliability of staff-only ratings and test-retest reliability of staff-only and collaborative ratings were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Convergent validity between MHRS ratings and standardised measures of social functioning and recovery was assessed using Pearson correlation. The influence of collaboration on ratings was assessed using descriptive statistics and ICCs.   RESULTS The MHRS was relatively quick and easy to use and had good test-retest reliability, but interrater reliability was inadequate. Collaborative ratings were slightly higher than staff-only ratings. Convergent validity suggests it assesses social function more than recovery.

Chemical analysis shows that the vessels and the raw glasses have similar compositional ranges and present the same evidence of unusually extensive contamination by fuel ash.It is suggested that all of the analyzed glasses-chunks, vessels, and moils-came from a single contaminated tank of glass that was employed during a relatively short period.

The new furnace consists of a melting chamber (tank) and two firing chambers, in an east-west axis. The raw glass produced at the site was blue, greenish blue, yellowish green, and yellowish brown glass of fair quality. Chemical analysis showed that it is soda-lime-silica glass typical of late Roman/Byzantine and early Islamic raw glass. According to the excavations, the furnace is probably of late Byzantine date, but a later dating in the early Islamic period is also plausible. The new evidence from Apolionia-Arsuf strengthens the assumption that this was a major center for primary and probably secondary glass production. The importance of Apollonia-Arsuf as a pre-Islamic urban center, as documented in Byzantine sources, could hint at the role of the church in the production and circulation of raw glass produced at the site.","Finally, there is a general correlation between K 2 O and Al 2 O 3 in the glasses analysed (Fig. 15), which is a reflection of the association of these components in feldspar or clay minerals in the glassmaking sand (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2004).","['Although the use of vessel cullet is a possibility in any secondary workshop, we detect no evidence for this in the present case.', 'The elements lead and copper, frequent contaminants during the recycling process (Freestone et al. 2002b) were not detected in any of the analysed glasses but this is to be expected as glasses coloured with these elements were uncommon in Palestine at this time.', 'However, the glass analysed contains no added manganese.', 'Manganese dioxide was commonly added to glass as a decolourant in the first millennium CE and occurs in some Egypt II and Levantine-type glass of the Byzantine and early Islamic periods.', 'Its presence might be expected if recycling of old glass had been occurring.', 'ICP-MS data (Freestone et al. 2000) indicate that the natural level of MnO in Levantine glass is approximately 200 ppm, and these are the levels detected here, at around the limit of detection of our EPMA method.', 'Finally, there is a general correlation between K 2 O and Al 2 O 3 in the glasses analysed (Fig. 15), which is a reflection of the association of these components in feldspar or clay minerals in the glassmaking sand (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2004).', 'In other secondary workshop assemblages, for example the Late Byzantine workshop at Ramla (Tal et al., 2008; see also Rehren et al., 2010) we have observed elevated K 2 O due to incorporation of ash during the melting process, as has been demonstrated in experimental replication of Roman glass working (Paynter, 2008).', 'Under such circumstances, the K 2 O-Al 2 O 3 correlation is perturbed and K 2 O shows a strong correlation with P 2 O 5 (Tal et al., 2008, Rehren et al., op. cit.) which is not observed in the HaGolan Street glass.', 'The absence of glass with elevated K 2 O resembles the compositions seen in a primary workshop (Freestone et al. 2000, Tal et al., 2004 and appears to reflect the use of relatively pristine glass.', 'Therefore as far as we are able to judge at the present time, recycling of old glass does not appear to have been a']",1,"['Finally, there is a general correlation between K 2 O and Al 2 O 3 in the glasses analysed (Fig. 15), which is a reflection of the association of these components in feldspar or clay minerals in the glassmaking sand (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2004).', 'In other secondary workshop assemblages, for example the Late Byzantine workshop at Ramla (Tal et al., 2008; see also Rehren et al., 2010) we have observed elevated K 2 O due to incorporation of ash during the melting process, as has been demonstrated in experimental replication of Roman glass working (Paynter, 2008).']"

While classical approaches are largely based on models of individual linguistic processing, recent advances stress the social coordinative nature of dialog. In the influential interactive alignment model, dialogue is thus approached as the progressive entrainment of interlocutors' linguistic behaviors toward the alignment of situation models. Still, the driving mechanisms are attributed to individual cognition in the form of automatic structural priming. Challenging these ideas, we outline a dynamical framework for studying dialog based on the notion of interpersonal synergy. Crucial to this synergetic model is the emphasis on dialog as an emergent, self-organizing, interpersonal system capable of functional coordination. A consequence of this model is that linguistic processes cannot be reduced to the workings of individual cognitive systems but must be approached also at the interpersonal level. From the synergy model follows a number of new predictions: beyond simple synchrony, good dialog affords complementary dynamics, constrained by contextual sensitivity and functional specificity. We substantiate our arguments by reference to recent empirical studies supporting the idea of dialog as interpersonal synergy.","A competing account has recently been proposed that regards inter-personal coordination in dialog as a form of synergy or dynamical coupling (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014).","['A competing account has recently been proposed that regards inter-personal coordination in dialog as a form of synergy or dynamical coupling (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014).', 'This approach is rooted in dynamical approaches to coordination that are levelagnostic, seeking to understand emergent phenomena at one level (e.g., the dyad) as arising through processes of self-organization from the constrained interaction of autonomous components at a lower level (the speaker/listeners) (Kelso, 1995;Latash, 2008).', 'This approach highlights the sensitivity of participants to real time recurrent interaction, as is evident even in the early interactions of infants and mothers (Murray and Trevarthen, 1986).', 'It emphasizes the intertwining of the movements of participants, leading to dimensional reduction, so that two interacting persons become, temporarily, a simpler collective entity than the two persons considered as a mere conjunction of individuals.', 'It acknowledges both synchronized and complementary actions as they contribute to this simplification, and it emphasizes the manner in which shared understanding of task constraints leads to stability of patterning in time.', 'Although still somewhat speculative, this level-independent approach seems commensurate with the approach to be developed here that treats groups of people as synergetically organized domains in their own right, with respect to which subjectivities of a collective nature can be identified.']",0,"['A competing account has recently been proposed that regards inter-personal coordination in dialog as a form of synergy or dynamical coupling (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014).']"

The argument is made by emphasising the coordinative aspects to speaking and music making, and downplaying the role of message passing with which linguistics has traditionally been concerned. A continuum is identified from silent speech on one hand to full blown music and song on the other. At each point, we see different coordinative forms and opportunities among subjects. Joint speech, where a group of people say the same text at the same time, is identified as an important point on this continuum, linking speech and music. Joint speech is familiar from collective prayer, protest chants, and many other contexts in which group purpose finds expression. An experimental form of joint speech, called synchronous speech, has been studied and some findings are recounted here. However the larger question of how and why joint speaking arises remains to be studied. I present a dynamical systems perspective on the coordination that joint speakers employ and show how it can account for some, but not yet all, aspects of the observed phenomenon.

However, quantitative analysis of speech rate has rarely been found in studies on synchronous speech. This study examines Mandarin Chinese (2 dialects from Taiwan and Shanghai), which is a syllable-time language and thus expected to exhibit a relatively stable speech rate, in both read-alone and read-together speech. Consistency and variability of speech rate are compared in both reading types across repetitions within a subject, across subjects, and across dialects. The results show that speech rate is more stable in read-together than in read-alone speech, and that speech rate in synchronous reading falls on a constant value of speech rate rather than on the average between the speakers' rates in pair. This global pattern is consistent across dialects, and stylized local variation of speech rate over prosodic units (Intonational phrase) is also observed unique to each dialect. We discuss how timing in synchronous speech cannot be accounted for only by dynamic entrainment of speakers with different speech rates and how there should also be rhythmic information shared by speakers of a language.","Speech produced in these constrained laboratory settings is remarkably unremarkable, and the technique of having subjects speak in synchrony has been used as a device for obtaining unmarked speech in several phonetic studies (Krivokapi�_, 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG and Nam, 2008;O'Dell et al., 2010;Dellwo and Friedrichs, 2012).","['In a series of behavioral studies in which speakers are asked to read novel texts in unison, no major differences that would serve to pick out speech as collective based on its acoustic characteristics alone have been observed (Cummins, 2014).', ""Speech produced in these constrained laboratory settings is remarkably unremarkable, and the technique of having subjects speak in synchrony has been used as a device for obtaining unmarked speech in several phonetic studies (Krivokapi�_, 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG and Nam, 2008;O'Dell et al., 2010;Dellwo and Friedrichs, 2012)."", 'The unmarked phonetic structure of speech elicited in the synchronous speaking situation contrasts strongly with the observation that texts recited in ritual and rite are frequently, if not inevitably, highly stylized in prosodic form.', 'For example, consider the typical pattern with which the Hail Mary is said when reciting the rosary, or, in a secular context, the characteristic form of the Pledge of Allegiance as recited by American schoolchildren.', 'Prosodic stylization thus appears as a reliable, but not necessary characteristic of joint speech.']",0,"[""Speech produced in these constrained laboratory settings is remarkably unremarkable, and the technique of having subjects speak in synchrony has been used as a device for obtaining unmarked speech in several phonetic studies (Krivokapi�_, 2007;#AUTHOR_TAG and Nam, 2008;O'Dell et al., 2010;Dellwo and Friedrichs, 2012).""]"

Moreover, bonobos produced more double looks when the barrier was opaque than when it had a window, indicating an understanding of what other individuals see.

Yet, the most natural and basic form of language use is dialogue. As a result, these accounts may only offer limited theories of the mechanisms that underlie language processing in general. We propose a mechanistic account of dialogue, the interactive alignment account, and use it to derive a number of predictions about basic language processes. The account assumes that, in dialogue, the linguistic representations employed by the interlocutors become aligned at many levels, as a result of a largely automatic process. This process greatly simplifies production and comprehension in dialogue. After considering the evidence for the interactive alignment model, we concentrate on three aspects of processing that follow from it. It makes use of a simple interactive inference mechanism, enables the development of local dialogue routines that greatly simplify language processing, and explains the origins of self-monitoring in production.

We propose that speakers compute inverse models derived from the discrepancy (error) between the utterance and the predicted utterance and use that to modify their production command or (occasionally) begin anew. We then propose that comprehenders monitor other people's speech by simulating their utterances using covert imitation and forward models, and then comparing those forward models with what they hear. They use the discrepancy to compute inverse models and modify their representation of the speaker's production command, or realize that their representation is incorrect and may develop a new production command.

Participation in such activities requires not only especially powerful forms of intention reading and cultural learning, but also a unique motivation to share psychological states with others and unique forms of cognitive representation for doing so. The result of participating in these activities is species-unique forms of cultural cognition and evolution, enabling everything from the creation and use of linguistic symbols to the construction of social norms and individual beliefs to the establishment of social institutions. In support of this proposal we argue and present evidence that great apes (and some children with autism) understand the basics of intentional action, but they still do not participate in activities involving joint intentions and attention (shared intentionality). Human children's skills of shared intentionality develop gradually during the first 14 months of life as two ontogenetic pathways intertwine: (1) the general ape line of understanding others as animate, goal-directed, and intentional agents; and (2) a species-unique motivation to share emotions, experience, and activities with other persons. The developmental outcome is children's ability to construct dialogic cognitive representations, which enable them to participate in earnest in the collectivity that is human cognition.","The interaction of voice and gaze may play a particularly strong role in allowing the protracted sustainment of conditions of joint attention, which appears as a possible foundation for the shared intentionality required to ground a human cultural world (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005) 5 .","['The empirical phenomena described above strongly highlight the importance of real time dynamic interaction among people in generating the subject-pole to which beliefs can sensibly be attributed.', 'The neural signature of collective speaking is found when speaking with a live speaker, but not with a recording (jasmin et al., in preparation).', 'Live conversational partners become entangled not only in ways that fit a linguistic description (lexical priming, syntactic biasing, phonological, and phonetic imitation, Pickering and Garrod, 2004), but in a host of subtle ways that have hitherto been treated of as non-linguistic.', 'These include gaze, posture, gestures, and blinks, but this set might conceivably be considerably extended as researchers turn their attention more and more to physiological markers of interaction (Campbell, 2007;Richardson et al., 2007;Shockley et al., 2009;Cummins, 2012;Wagner et al., 2014).', 'The voice is an important part of the means by which a collective perspective is established and maintained, but it is one among many.', 'The interaction of voice and gaze may play a particularly strong role in allowing the protracted sustainment of conditions of joint attention, which appears as a possible foundation for the shared intentionality required to ground a human cultural world (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005) 5 .']",0,"['The empirical phenomena described above strongly highlight the importance of real time dynamic interaction among people in generating the subject-pole to which beliefs can sensibly be attributed.', 'The interaction of voice and gaze may play a particularly strong role in allowing the protracted sustainment of conditions of joint attention, which appears as a possible foundation for the shared intentionality required to ground a human cultural world (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2005) 5 .']"

Episodes of joint attentional focus between mother and child--for example, joint play with an object--were identified. Inside, as opposed to outside, these episodes both mothers and children produced more utterances, mothers used shorter sentences and more comments, and dyads engaged in longer conversations. Inside joint episodes maternal references to objects that were already the child's focus of attention were positively correlated with the child's vocabulary at 21 months, while object references that attempted to redirect the child's attention were negatively correlated. No measures from outside these episodes related to child language. In an experimental study, an adult attempted to teach novel words to 10 17-month-old children. Words referring to objects on which the child's attention was already focused were learned better than words presented in an attempt to redirect the child's attentional focus.","The ability to follow each other's gaze thus facilitates the sharing of attention, and has been demonstrated to structure mother-child interactions, while inducing the abilty to take part in languaging (#AUTHOR_TAG and Farrar, 1986).","['If joint languaging provides a very powerful example of intentional alignment, then it might be that that the ability to coordinate the manner in which we jointly pay attention to the world is an important skill that facilitated the emergence of such behavior, as argued in Fusaroli and Tyl��n (2012).', 'Sometime between the last speciation event some 5 or 6 million years ago that gave rise to chimpanzees and bonobos on the one hand, and the hominid line on the other, something happened that had profound consequences for our ability to share perspectives and to coordinate with one another.', 'There is one small biological change that we know occurred in that time, that might play a significant role here.', 'That change gave rise to the white sclera of the human eye that contrasts vividly with the darker iris, thus providing a very clean signal of the direction of gaze of a partner (Tomasello et al., 2007).', 'The other great apes do not have such a contrast, and their ability to align their gaze is severely limited, and based on head direction rather than the eyes-although chimpanzees and bonobos in particular do display some evidence of understanding the visual perspective of another (Okamoto-Barth et al., 2007).', ""The ability to follow each other's gaze thus facilitates the sharing of attention, and has been demonstrated to structure mother-child interactions, while inducing the abilty to take part in languaging (#AUTHOR_TAG and Farrar, 1986).""]",0,"['If joint languaging provides a very powerful example of intentional alignment, then it might be that that the ability to coordinate the manner in which we jointly pay attention to the world is an important skill that facilitated the emergence of such behavior, as argued in Fusaroli and Tyln (2012).', ""The ability to follow each other's gaze thus facilitates the sharing of attention, and has been demonstrated to structure mother-child interactions, while inducing the abilty to take part in languaging (#AUTHOR_TAG and Farrar, 1986).""]"
CC596,82846198,"Voice, (inter-)subjectivity, and real time recurrent interaction",Fred Cummins,On the distribution and reference of empty pronouns,"[""C.-T J Huang""]","In a 1982 paper John R. Ross suggests that languages may be classifi ed using Marshall McLuhanÕs (1964) Òhot-coolÓ division of the media. According to McLuhan, a medium is ÒhotÓ if the communication process involves little or no audience participation, and ÒcoolÓ if active audience participation is required. A movie is thus a ÒhotÓ medium in that most of what it is intended to convey is presented before the viewerÕs eyes, whereas the telephone is a ÒcoolÓ medium in that the success of communication depends upon considerable participation by the hearer. Commercial TV programs may be relatively ÒhotÓ since communication requires relatively little effort on the part of the audience, but an Oriental painting or RussellÕs An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth will be ÒcoolÓ since full appreciation of their messages requires considerable effort on the part of the viewer or reader. Ross suggests that the same analogy may be extended to classifying languages on the basis of the explicitness with which they express certain anaphoric elements. For example, English may be said to be a ÒhotÓ language because pronouns cannot in general be omitted from grammatical sentences, and the information required to understand each sentence is largely obtainable from what is overtly seen and heard in it. On the other hand, Chinese may be said to be a very ÒcoolÓ language in that such pronouns are usually omissible (and are often more naturally omitted) from grammatical sentences, and understanding a sentence requires some work on the readerÕs or the hearerÕs part, which may involve inference, context, and knowledge of the world, among other things. Other languages can be depicted as having a status somewhere between these two extremes, allowing more freedom than the ÒhotÓ languages, but less than the ÒcoolÓ ones, for the use of empty or zero pronouns. For the sake of concreteness, let us look at a few examples in terms of this Òhot-coolÓ descriptive parameter.","This is not merely a syntactic quirk of one group of languages, as it is found in such typologically distant languages as Japanese, Chinese, Turkish, and Spanish (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1984).","['As common ground is established, the subjective point from which utterances are spoken also shifts.', 'Vygotsky has pointed out how the (linguistic) subject becomes an implied, rather than an overt, element in speech once common understanding has been established (Vygotsky, 1986, p. 236).', 'For example, it would be odd to respond to the question ""Would you like a cup of tea?"" with the answer ""No, I don\'t want a cup of tea,"" instead of simply ""No.""', 'Similarly, a group of people waiting for a bus establishes sufficient shared context that no one is likely to point out the obvious and say ""The bus for which we are waiting is coming,"" but simply ""coming"" or some such expression.', 'The dropping of the linguistic subject is more extensive yet in inner speech, of which Vygotsky says ""it is as much a law of inner speech to omit subjects as it is a law of written speech to contain both subjects and predicates"" (Vygotsky, 1986, p. 243).', 'Many languages allow dropping of any explicit mention of the subject once they can be inferred on pragmatic grounds.', 'This is not merely a syntactic quirk of one group of languages, as it is found in such typologically distant languages as Japanese, Chinese, Turkish, and Spanish (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1984).']",0,"['This is not merely a syntactic quirk of one group of languages, as it is found in such typologically distant languages as Japanese, Chinese, Turkish, and Spanish (#AUTHOR_TAG, 1984).']"

We base our review on the social shaping of the human mind and discuss various aspects of brain function related to social interaction. Despite private mental contents, people can share their understanding of the world using, beyond verbal communication, nonverbal cues such as gestures, facial expressions, and postures. The understanding of nonverbal messages is supported by the brain's mirroring systems that are shaped by individual experience. Within the organism-environment system, tight links exist between action and perception, both within an individual and between several individuals. Therefore, any comprehensive brain imaging study of the neuronal basis of social cognition requires appreciation of the situated and embodied nature of human cognition, motivating simultaneous monitoring of brain and bodily functions within a socially relevant environment. Because single-person studies alone cannot unravel the dynamic aspects of interpersonal interactions, it seems both necessary and beneficial to move towards ""two-person neuroscience""; technological shortcomings and a limited conceptual framework have so far hampered such a leap.

Schematically, the root of the answer lies in the theory of autopoiesis. Second, it provides a core articulation between the various areas and disciplines involved in cognitive science by following the natural process of the genesis of living forms.

Jupp"", ""Peter M. Cox""]","A two-box model for equator-to-pole planetary heat transport is extended to include simple atmospheric dynamics. The surface drag coefficient CD is treated as a free parameter and solutions are calculated analytically in terms of the dimensionless planetary parameters eta (atmospheric thickness), omega (rotation rate) and xi (advective capability). Solutions corresponding to maximum entropy production (MEP) are compared with solutions previously obtained from dynamically unconstrained two-box models. As long as the advective capability xi is sufficiently large, dynamically constrained MEP solutions are identical to dynamically unconstrained MEP solutions. Consequently, the addition of a dynamical constraint does not alter the previously obtained MEP results for Earth, Mars and Titan, and an analogous result is presented here for Venus. The rate of entropy production in an MEP state is shown to be independent of rotation rate if the advective capability xi is sufficiently large (as for the four examples in the solar system), or if the rotation rate omega is sufficiently small. The model indicates, however, that the dynamical constraint does influence the MEP state when xi is small, which might be the case for some extrasolar planets. Finally, results from the model developed here are compared with previous numerical simulations in which the effect of varying surface drag coefficient on entropy production was calculated.","Since then, further work has shown that MEP yields reasonable predictions of hemispheric heat transport on other planetary bodies [14,73] and of empirical friction coefficients in atmospheric general circulation models [15,74], but also for vertical convection [71,75,49,37,51,#AUTHOR_TAG] and convection at hydrothermal vents at the seafloor [77].","['To start, the generation rate for atmospheric motion is close to the power that can be extracted from large-scale heating gradient to fuel motion (cf.', ""Section 4), suggesting that the Earth's atmospheric circulation operates at its maximum strength."", 'This was initially suggested by Edward Lorenz [70], and is closely related to the hypothesis formulated by Paltridge [71,13,72] that the atmospheric circulation maximizes entropy production.', 'Since then, further work has shown that MEP yields reasonable predictions of hemispheric heat transport on other planetary bodies [14,73] and of empirical friction coefficients in atmospheric general circulation models [15,74], but also for vertical convection [71,75,49,37,51,#AUTHOR_TAG] and convection at hydrothermal vents at the seafloor [77].', 'More support comes from studies of turbulence and its effects on heat transport and entropy production [78][79][80][81][82].']",0,"['Since then, further work has shown that MEP yields reasonable predictions of hemispheric heat transport on other planetary bodies [14,73] and of empirical friction coefficients in atmospheric general circulation models [15,74], but also for vertical convection [71,75,49,37,51,#AUTHOR_TAG] and convection at hydrothermal vents at the seafloor [77].']"

Part II: Latent Heat Transport and Moist Processes,"[""Olivier Pauluis"", ""Isaac M. Held""]","In moist convection, atmospheric motions transport water vapor from the earth's surface to the regions where condensation occurs. This transport is associated with three other aspects of convection: the latent heat transport, the expansion work performed by water vapor, and the irreversible entropy production due to diffusion of water vapor and phase changes. An analysis of the thermodynamic transformations of atmospheric water yields what is referred to as the entropy budget of the water substance, providing a quantitative relationship between these three aspects of moist convection. The water vapor transport can be viewed as an imperfect heat engine that produces less mechanical work than the corresponding Carnot cycle because of diffusion of water vapor and irreversible phase changes. The entropy budget of the water substance provides an alternative method of determining the irreversible entropy production due to phase changes and diffusion of water vapor. This method has the advantage that it does not require explicit knowledge of the relative humidity or of the molecular flux of water vapor for the estimation of the entropy production. Scaling arguments show that the expansion work of water vapor accounts for a small fraction of the work that would be produced in the absence of irreversible moist processes. It is also shown that diffusion of water vapor and irreversible phase changes can be interpreted as the irreversible counterpart to the continuous dehumidification resulting from condensation and precipitation. This leads to a description of moist convection where it acts more as an atmospheric dehumidifier than as a heat engine.","Thermodynamics has also been applied to physical processes of the Earth system, e.g. the generation and dissipation of atmospheric motion [12] and associated optimality [13][14][15], the intensity of hurricanes [16], hydrological processes at the land surface [17,18], the atmospheric branch of hydrologic cycle [19,#AUTHOR_TAG], ocean dynamics [21,22], and, obviously, geochemical transformations.","['One fundamental theory in physics that allows us to address these questions is thermodynamics.', 'Central to thermodynamics are the first and second laws.', 'While the first law of thermodynamics quantifies how much work can be extracted from gradients in heating and cooling under the constraint of energy conservation, the second law tells us about the irreversibility of processes and thereby provides us with an ""arrow of time"" [11].', 'Most common applications of thermodynamics are usually found in engineering, for instance the typical applications to the Carnot cycle of heat engines and refrigerators.', 'Thermodynamics has also been applied to physical processes of the Earth system, e.g. the generation and dissipation of atmospheric motion [12] and associated optimality [13][14][15], the intensity of hurricanes [16], hydrological processes at the land surface [17,18], the atmospheric branch of hydrologic cycle [19,#AUTHOR_TAG], ocean dynamics [21,22], and, obviously, geochemical transformations.', 'These processes generally operate away from a state of thermodynamic equilibrium and there is some evidence that these operate in steady states at which they maximize their dissipative activity, or, almost equivalently, maximize power generation or entropy production (the proposed Maximum Entropy Production (MEP) principle, [23][24][25][26][27]).']",5,"['Thermodynamics has also been applied to physical processes of the Earth system, e.g. the generation and dissipation of atmospheric motion [12] and associated optimality [13][14][15], the intensity of hurricanes [16], hydrological processes at the land surface [17,18], the atmospheric branch of hydrologic cycle [19,#AUTHOR_TAG], ocean dynamics [21,22], and, obviously, geochemical transformations.']"

The myriad of processes that transform energy, that result in the motion of mass in the atmosphere, in oceans, and on land, processes that drive the global water, carbon, and other biogeo- chemical cycles, all have in common that they are irre- versible in their nature. Entropy production is a general consequence of these processes and measures their de- gree of irreversibility. The proposed principle of max- imum entropy production (MEP) states that systems are driven to steady states in which they produce en- tropy at the maximum possible rate given the prevailing constraints. In this review, the basics of nonequilibrium thermodynamics are described, as well as how these apply to Earth system processes. Applications of the MEP principle are discussed, ranging from the strength of the atmospheric circulation, the hydrological cycle, and biogeochemical cycles to the role that life plays in these processes. Nonequilibrium thermodynamics and the MEP principle have potentially wide-ranging implications for our understanding of Earth system functioning, how it has evolved in the past, and why it is habitable. Entropy production allows us to quantify an objective direction of Earth system change (closer to vs further away from thermodynamic equilibrium, or, equivalently, towards a state of MEP). When a max- imum in entropy production is reached, MEP implies that the Earth system reacts to perturbations primarily with negative feedbacks. In conclusion, this nonequilib- rium thermodynamic view of the Earth system shows great promise to establish a holistic description of the Earth as one system. This perspective is likely to allow us to better understand and predict its function as one entity, how it has evolved in the past, and how it is modified by human activities in the future.","These processes generally operate away from a state of thermodynamic equilibrium and there is some evidence that these operate in steady states at which they maximize their dissipative activity, or, almost equivalently, maximize power generation or entropy production (the proposed Maximum Entropy Production (MEP) principle, [23][24][25]#AUTHOR_TAG[27]).","['One fundamental theory in physics that allows us to address these questions is thermodynamics.', 'Central to thermodynamics are the first and second laws.', 'While the first law of thermodynamics quantifies how much work can be extracted from gradients in heating and cooling under the constraint of energy conservation, the second law tells us about the irreversibility of processes and thereby provides us with an ""arrow of time"" [11].', 'Most common applications of thermodynamics are usually found in engineering, for instance the typical applications to the Carnot cycle of heat engines and refrigerators.', 'Thermodynamics has also been applied to physical processes of the Earth system, e.g. the generation and dissipation of atmospheric motion [12] and associated optimality [13][14][15], the intensity of hurricanes [16], hydrological processes at the land surface [17,18], the atmospheric branch of hydrologic cycle [19,20], ocean dynamics [21,22], and, obviously, geochemical transformations.', 'These processes generally operate away from a state of thermodynamic equilibrium and there is some evidence that these operate in steady states at which they maximize their dissipative activity, or, almost equivalently, maximize power generation or entropy production (the proposed Maximum Entropy Production (MEP) principle, [23][24][25]#AUTHOR_TAG[27]).']",0,"['These processes generally operate away from a state of thermodynamic equilibrium and there is some evidence that these operate in steady states at which they maximize their dissipative activity, or, almost equivalently, maximize power generation or entropy production (the proposed Maximum Entropy Production (MEP) principle, [23][24][25]#AUTHOR_TAG[27]).']"

Attention thus shifts to the physically different kinetic energy (KE) reservoirs of the circulation and their maintenance, dissipation, and possible influence on the very small scales representing irreversible molecular mixing. Oceanic KE is dominated by the geostrophic eddy field, and depending on the vertical structure (barotropic versus low-mode baroclinic), direct and inverse energy cascades are possible.

The geological record reads that liquid water was always present and that the pH was never far from neutral. During this same period, however, the Earth's radiation environment underwent large changes. As the sun moved along the course set by the main sequence of stars its output will have increased at least 30% and possibly 100%. It may also have fluctuated in brightness over periods of a few million years. At the same time hydrogen was escaping to space from the Earth and so causing progressive changes in the chemical environment.

It may have been that these physical and chemical changes always by blind chance followed the path whose bounds are the conditions favouring the continued existence of life.

Most prominently, the Gaia hypothesis addresses this question by proposing that near-homeostatic conditions on Earth have been maintained by and for the biosphere. Here the role of the biota in the Earth system is described from a viewpoint of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, particularly with respect to the hypothesis of maximum entropy production (MEP). It is argued that the biota introduce additional degrees of freedom to Earth system processes. Therefore, we should expect biotic activity, and Earth system processes affected by the biota, to evolve to states of MEP. The consistent effects of the biota on entropy production are demonstrated with a conceptual model of biogeochemical cycling, by using extreme climate model simulations of a Desert World and a Green Planet, and by a simple coupled climate-carbon cycle model. It is shown that homeostatic behavior can emerge from a state of MEP associated with the planetary albedo. This thermodynamic perspective is then discussed in the context of the original Gaia hypothesis and in light of a recent discussion in Climatic Change. Potential implications of the MEP hypothesis for global change research are also discussed. It is concluded that the resulting behavior of a biotic Earth at a state of MEP may well lead to near-homeostatic behavior of the Earth system on long time scales, as stated by the Gaia hypothesis. However, here homeostasis is a result of the application of the MEP hypothesis to biotically influenced processes rather than a postulate. Besides providing a fundamental perspective on homeostasis, the MEP hypothesis also provides a framework to understand why photosynthetic life would be a highly probable emergent characteristic of the Earth system and why the diversity of life is an important characteristic of Earth system functioning.","To characterize the organization of the steady state that describes the sum of all living organisms, in an ecosystem at the small scale, or in the biosphere at the global scale, the same thermodynamic maximization principles have been proposed, first by Lotka [31,32], and further explored by others [33][34][35][36]#AUTHOR_TAG[38][39].","['As noted by Boltzmann [28] and Schroedinger [29], thermodynamics must apply to the living organisms as well.', 'Life feeds on low entropy ""food"" and rejects high entropy ""waste"" products and heat, thereby fueling its metabolism and sustaining its structure.', 'Living organisms, just as any other dissipative process, maintain their state away from thermodynamic equilibrium by an overall net export of entropy to the surroundings.', 'This commonality of living organisms and purely physical dissipative processes led Lovelock and Margulis [30] to use the metaphor of describing Earth as a superorganism.', 'To characterize the organization of the steady state that describes the sum of all living organisms, in an ecosystem at the small scale, or in the biosphere at the global scale, the same thermodynamic maximization principles have been proposed, first by Lotka [31,32], and further explored by others [33][34][35][36]#AUTHOR_TAG[38][39].']",0,"['As noted by Boltzmann [28] and Schroedinger [29], thermodynamics must apply to the living organisms as well.', 'Life feeds on low entropy ""food"" and rejects high entropy ""waste"" products and heat, thereby fueling its metabolism and sustaining its structure.', 'Living organisms, just as any other dissipative process, maintain their state away from thermodynamic equilibrium by an overall net export of entropy to the surroundings.', 'This commonality of living organisms and purely physical dissipative processes led Lovelock and Margulis [30] to use the metaphor of describing Earth as a superorganism.', 'To characterize the organization of the steady state that describes the sum of all living organisms, in an ecosystem at the small scale, or in the biosphere at the global scale, the same thermodynamic maximization principles have been proposed, first by Lotka [31,32], and further explored by others [33][34][35][36]#AUTHOR_TAG[38][39].']"

This second law refers to energyÕs inevitable tendency to change from being concentrated in one place to becoming spread out over time.

N/P ratio of the East Sea below 300m is estimated as 12.4, quite lower than the Redfield ratio of 16. Intense N/P ratio and oxygen minimum zones are founded between 900m and 2200m in the Ulleung Basin. Two stations are strongly expected to occur denitrification, where is located within the Ulleung Basin, show a series of phenomena at specific depths that nitrate profile is reversed, N/P ratio is less than 12.4, and nitrite shows a peak.

We find excellent agreement with an idealized grey radiative-convective model with no shortwave absorption for D =1 and C =1~2 depending on the surface-atmosphere temperature contrast and on the imposed critical lapse rate.

While this may indeed be a reasonable claim, we argue that it is not justified by the experiments described in the research. We report on a series of experiments that demonstrate that labels can play a causal role in category formation during infancy. Ten-month-old infants were taught to group computer-displayed, novel cartoon drawings into two categories under tightly controlled experimental conditions. Infants were given the opportunity to learn the two categories under four conditions: Without any labels, with two labels that correlated with category membership, with two labels assigned randomly to objects, and with one label assigned to all objects. Category formation was assessed identically in all conditions using a novelty preference procedure conducted in the absence of any labels. The labelling condition had a decisive impact on the way infants formed categories: When two labels correlated with the visual category information, infants learned two categories, just as if there had been no labels presented.

The conditions differed in the object choices presented when novel Word #2 was introduced.

In Study 1, 24-month-old children and 2 adults played with 3 nameless objects. These objects were placed in a clear box along with a novel nameless object. The adults then displayed excitement about the contents of the box and modeled a new word. Comparison with a control condition indicated significant learning of the new word for the novel object. Study 2 followed the same procedure with one difference: the children played with the novel object while the adults were absent. Thus, at the time of the language model the target object was novel only to the adults, not to the children. Again subjects displayed significant learning of the new word. This last finding suggests that 24-month-old children understand that adults use language for things that are novel to the discourse context and that this novelty is determined from the speaker's point of view.","For example, children will track who is present when they hear a new word (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1996), whether the speaker has provided reliable information before (e.g., Jaswal and Neely, 2006) and whether a question is repeated (e.g., Samuel and Bryant, 1984).","['In the real world children learn through play and independent exploration (Hirsh-Pasek et al., 2009).', 'However, in the lab children are seldom alone.', ""This is important because children adjust their learning depending on who is providing information (e.g., the same or different experimenter, Goldenberg and Sandhofer, 2013;human or robot, O'Connell et al., 2009; mom or dad, Pancsofar and Vernon-Feagans, 2006)."", 'Children are also opportunistic and will look for any signal of what the right answer is.', 'For example, children will track who is present when they hear a new word (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1996), whether the speaker has provided reliable information before (e.g., Jaswal and Neely, 2006) and whether a question is repeated (e.g., Samuel and Bryant, 1984).', 'Thus, who is involved in learning matters both for learning in general and for category learning specifically.', 'Moreover, who the child is also matters.', 'For example, children with larger vocabularies more flexibly categorize the same stimuli on multiple dimensions (Ellis and Oakes, 2006;Horst et al., 2009); right-handed participants are more likely to associate ""good"" with right and ""bad"" with left (Casasanto and Henetz, 2012); and female participants learn phonologically-familiar novel words better than male participants do (Kaushanskaya et al., 2011(Kaushanskaya et al., , 2013.']",1,"['For example, children will track who is present when they hear a new word (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 1996), whether the speaker has provided reliable information before (e.g., Jaswal and Neely, 2006) and whether a question is repeated (e.g., Samuel and Bryant, 1984).']"

We asked whether 16-month-old children's naming of nonsolids would improve if they were tested in that typical context. Children tested in the highchair demonstrated better understanding of how nonsolids are named. Furthermore, context-based differences in exploration drove differences in the properties attended to in real-time.

This is problematic because it is unclear whether children's performance reflects recall of the correct name-object association or simply selection of the only object that was singled out by being the only object named. Children introduced to one novel name may perform at ceiling as they are not required to discriminate on the basis of the name per se, and appear to rapidly learn words following minimal exposure to a single word. We introduced children to four novel objects. For half the children, only one of the objects was named and for the other children, all four objects were named. Only children introduced to one word reliably selected the target object at test. This demonstration highlights the over-simplicity of one-word learning paradigms and the need for a shift in word learning paradigms where more than one word is taught to ensure children disambiguate objects on the basis of their names rather than their degree of salience.","As dozens of studies illustrate, ""boring"" factors like counterbalancing and stimuli choice during both learning and testing can have a profound effect on findings, including trial order (Wilkinson et al., 2003), how many targets (#AUTHOR_TAG and Horst, 2013) or competitors (Horst et al., 2010) are presented, or the color of the stimuli (Samuelson and Horst, 2007;.","[""Subtle experimental design decisions, such as the number of test trials to include, may not seem theoretically significant, but they can have profound effects on children's behavior."", 'As dozens of studies illustrate, ""boring"" factors like counterbalancing and stimuli choice during both learning and testing can have a profound effect on findings, including trial order (Wilkinson et al., 2003), how many targets (#AUTHOR_TAG and Horst, 2013) or competitors (Horst et al., 2010) are presented, or the color of the stimuli (Samuelson and Horst, 2007;.', 'For example, how broadly participants generalize a category label depends on where the exemplars are presented and if the exemplars are visible simultaneously (Spencer et al., 2011).', 'In particular whether more or less diverse examples occur in the first block of trials influences later generalization (see Spencer et al., 2011, Supplementary Materials).', 'A result like this sheds light onto the generalization process: deciding how broadly a category should be applied depends on the timing of experience with exemplars (see Oakes and Spalding, 1997;Samuelson and Horst, 2007, for similar findings).']",4,"[""Subtle experimental design decisions, such as the number of test trials to include, may not seem theoretically significant, but they can have profound effects on children's behavior."", 'As dozens of studies illustrate, ""boring"" factors like counterbalancing and stimuli choice during both learning and testing can have a profound effect on findings, including trial order (Wilkinson et al., 2003), how many targets (#AUTHOR_TAG and Horst, 2013) or competitors (Horst et al., 2010) are presented, or the color of the stimuli (Samuelson and Horst, 2007;.']"

In Experiment 3, infants received frequent experience with a set of similar or dissimilar exemplars, and the same pattern was observed.

Much of this knowledge requires concepts and this paper focuses on how people acquire concepts. It is argued that conceptual development progresses from simple perceptual grouping to highly abstract scientific concepts. This proposal of conceptual development has four parts. First, it is argued that categories in the world have different structure. Second, there might be different learning systems (sub-served by different brain mechanisms) that evolved to learn categories of differing structures. Third, these systems exhibit differential maturational course, which affects how categories of different structures are learned in the course of development. And finally, an interaction of these components may result in the developmental transition from perceptual groupings to more abstract concepts. This paper reviews a large body of empirical evidence supporting this proposal.","All categories are not created equal: categories vary in complexity and withincategory similarity (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2010).","['All categories are not created equal: categories vary in complexity and withincategory similarity (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2010).', 'Where children draw boundaries between categories is influenced by category (object) properties, including distinctive features (Hammer and Diesendruck, 2005), number of common features (Samuelson and Horst, 2007;Horst and Twomey, 2013), visual cues to animacy (Jones et al., 1991), the presence of category labels (Sloutsky and Fisher, 2004;Plunkett et al., 2008) and the presence of other objects (e.g., identical or nonidentical exemplars Oakes and Ribar, 2005;Kovack-Lesh and Oakes, 2007).']",0,"['All categories are not created equal: categories vary in complexity and withincategory similarity (#AUTHOR_TAG, 2010).', 'Where children draw boundaries between categories is influenced by category (object) properties, including distinctive features (Hammer and Diesendruck, 2005), number of common features (Samuelson and Horst, 2007;Horst and Twomey, 2013), visual cues to animacy (Jones et al., 1991), the presence of category labels (Sloutsky and Fisher, 2004;Plunkett et al., 2008) and the presence of other objects (e.g., identical or nonidentical exemplars Oakes and Ribar, 2005;Kovack-Lesh and Oakes, 2007).']"

To solve this, researchers have posited constraints, and inference strategies, but assume that determining the referent of a novel word is isomorphic to learning. We present an alternative in which referent selection is an online process and independent of long-term learning. We illustrate this theoretical approach with a dynamic associative model in which referent selection emerges from real-time competition between referents and learning is associative (Hebbian). This model accounts for a range of findings including the differences in expressive and receptive vocabulary, cross-situational learning under high degrees of ambiguity, accelerating (vocabulary explosion) and decelerating (power law) learning, fast mapping by mutual exclusivity (and differences in bilinguals), improvements in familiar word recognition with development, and correlations between speed of processing and learning. Together it suggests that (a) association learning buttressed by dynamic competition can account for much of the literature; (b) familiar word recognition is subserved by the same processes that identify the referents of novel words (fast mapping); (c) online competition may allow the children to leverage information available in the task to augment performance despite slow learning; (d) in complex systems, associative learning is highly multifaceted; and (e) learning and referent selection, though logically distinct, can be subtly related. It suggests more sophisticated ways of describing the interaction between situation- and developmental-time processes and points to the need for considering such interactions as a primary determinant of development.PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved.","Children (and adults) are constantly learning: experimenters' distinction between learning vs. test trials is arbitrary with respect to the processes that operate within the task (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012).","['Categorization does not reflect static knowledge; rather, category learning unfolds over time and is a product of nested timescales.', ""Children (and adults) are constantly learning: experimenters' distinction between learning vs. test trials is arbitrary with respect to the processes that operate within the task (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012)."", 'That is, learning continues even on test trials-in fact, participants may not realize the shift from learning to test trials.', 'Consequently, different behaviors are observed depending on when during the categorization process category learning is assessed (Horst et al., 2005).']",2,"[""Children (and adults) are constantly learning: experimenters' distinction between learning vs. test trials is arbitrary with respect to the processes that operate within the task (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2012).""]"

In Experiment 1, prior to each test trial, one group of infants was shown an addition event (1 + 1) while another group was shown a subtraction event (2 - 1). On test trials, all infants were shown outcomes of 0, 1, 2 and 3. The results seemed to require one of two dual-process models. One such model assumed that the infants could add and subtract but also had a tendency to look longer when more items were on the stage. The other model assumed that infants had a preference for familiarity along with the tendency to look longer when more items were on the stage. Experiments 2 and 3 examined the assumptions made by these two models. In Experiment 2, infants were given only the test trials they had received in Experiment 1. Thus, no addition and subtraction or familiarity was involved. In Experiment 3 infants were familiarized to either one or two items prior to each test trial, but experienced no actual addition or subtraction. The results of these two experiments support the familiarity plus more items to look at model more than the addition and subtraction plus more items to look at model. Taken together, these three experiments shed doubt on Wynn's (1992a) assertion that 5-month-old infants can add and subtract. Instead they indicate the importance of familiarity preferences and the fact that one should be cautious before assuming that young infants have sophisticated numerical abilities.

In the current study, we investigate how the number of shared features among objects influences childrenÕs novel noun generalizations, explanations for these generalizations and spontaneous speech. Preschool children and adults were presented with test objects that shared only one feature (e.g. shape) or that shared two features (e.g. material and colour). After each trial, participants were asked, Ôhow did you know that was your [novel name]?Õ Overall, participants generalized novel names on the basis of shape more when objects shared shape and a second feature with the exemplar. All participants provided shape-based explanations of their choices, but explanations were increasingly more abstract across development. Finally, childrenÕs spontaneous speech was dominated by references to the objectsÕ shape, and this did not change across development or number of shared features. Overall, these data demonstrate that the shape bias is enhanced when objects share shape and a second feature but weakened for 3-year-old children when objects share two non-shape features.

The objects varied in shape, size, and texture. For half of the subjects, the objects had eyes--a property strongly associated with certain material kinds. If young children know this association, they should attend to texture as well as shape in classifying objects with eyes. With named objects only, both 2- and 3-year-old children classified eyeless objects by shape and objects with eyes by both shape and texture. The results suggest that very young children possess considerable knowledge about conditional relations between kinds of perceptual properties.

Referrals by movement disorder specialists vs other sources differed significantly in their percentages of good candidates (66.7% vs 40.4%, P = .002) and possible future candidates (14.7% vs 32.7%, P = .02) but not poor candidates (18.7% vs 25.0%, P = .60). Over the observed period of referrals, the yearly percentages significantly decreased for good candidates and increased for possible future candidates and poor candidates. Conclusions:ÊCompared with findings in prior studies, the quality of DBS referrals has improved. The increase in referral of possible future candidates and poor candidates may reflect greater confidence in the procedure.","Adequate expertise is necessary, as movement disorder specialists are more likely to identify good candidates for DBS (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2011).","['For the patient-related dimension, we found that neurologists are key players both for information and referral of patients.', 'This finding highlights the importance of an adequate and up-to-date training of neurologists in private practice about DBS.', 'Correct information is necessary, as a timely elucidation about DBS as well as responding to the individual concerns by the consulting physician is essential for the acceptance of the treatment (S�_dmeyer et al. 2012).', 'Adequate expertise is necessary, as movement disorder specialists are more likely to identify good candidates for DBS (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2011).', 'The development of DBS requires that neurologists are regularly informed about new indications, technological improvements, as well as newly investigated risks.']",4,"['For the patient-related dimension, we found that neurologists are key players both for information and referral of patients.', 'This finding highlights the importance of an adequate and up-to-date training of neurologists in private practice about DBS.', 'Adequate expertise is necessary, as movement disorder specialists are more likely to identify good candidates for DBS (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2011).', 'The development of DBS requires that neurologists are regularly informed about new indications, technological improvements, as well as newly investigated risks.']"

COMPRESS resulted in the classification of patients into three categories: ""optimal candidate,""""probable candidate,"" and ""not a good candidate."" Similar categorical ratings made by a referring private practice neurologist and by a trained movement disorders specialist were compared with the ratings generated by COMPRESS.A total of 19 subjects with Parkinson's disease were enrolled from five private neurological practices. The clinical impressions of the private practice neurologist vs. those of the movement disorders specialist were in agreement approximately half the time (10/19 cases). The movement disorders specialist and COMPRESS agreed on 15/19 cases. A further comparison between outcomes from the entire COMPRESS module and the FLASQ-PD questionnaire by itself resulted in high agreement (18/19 cases in agreement).The COMPRESS agreed with an in-person evaluation by a movement disorders neurologist approximately 80% of the time.

We have outcomes data, but I would argue that they are far too limited and not to the level required in the 21st century. I have asked myself many times why the surgical profession has not focused on this issue more than it has. I agree with Dr. [Joseph] Fins' comments in his presentation [see previous article in this supplement] that it would be nice to have a bottom-up approach rather than a top-down approach, but I do not see a change until we as physicians step up to the plate and make a change. Why haven't we? There are a number of reasons. The malpractice climate in the United States has been one major factor. Surgeons fear disclosure. The relationship between a surgeon and the patient is professional and private, and physicians do not want transparency--they do not want their patient or anyone to know that an adverse event or bad outcome has occurred. Also, doctors, especially surgeons, are reluctant to use guidelines or follow protocols. I participated a number of years ago in an American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons project called MODEMS; it was an attempt to set up guidelines for orthopedic surgeons to manage back pain, shoulder pain, and other orthopedic conditions. By the time we fi nished we had accomplished nothing, because the protocols and guidelines were so extensive that almost any type of management for any patient would be compliant.

Guidelines for safe and ethical conduct of such procedures have previously and independently been proposed by various local and regional expert groups. Methods To expand on these earlier documents, representative members of continental and international psychiatric and neurosurgical societies, joined efforts to further elaborate and adopt a pragmatic worldwide set of guidelines. These are intended to address a broad range of neuropsychiatric disorders, brain targets and neurosurgical techniques, taking into account cultural and social heterogeneities of healthcare environments. Findings The proposed consensus document highlights that, while stereotactic ablative procedures such as cingulotomy and capsulotomy for depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder are considered 'established' in some countries, they still lack level I evidence. Further, it is noted that deep brain stimulation in any brain target hitherto tried, and for any psychiatric or behavioural disorder, still remains at an investigational stage. Researchers are encouraged to design randomised controlled trials, based on scientific and data-driven rationales for disease and brain target selection. Experienced multidisciplinary teams are a mandatory requirement for the safe and ethical conduct of any psychiatric neurosurgery, ensuring documented refractoriness of patients, proper consent procedures that respect patient's capacity and autonomy, multifaceted preoperative as well as postoperative long-term follow-up evaluation, and reporting of effects and side effects for all patients. Interpretation This consensus document on ethical and scientific conduct of psychiatric surgery worldwide is designed to enhance patient safety.","In particular, an international expert panel has recently stated in a consensus paper that ""until scientifically proven otherwise, DBS is not superior to ablative surgery for psychiatric disorders"" (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2014).","['An interesting finding is that the majority of experts of our survey have a relatively positive attitude regarding lesion procedures in movement disorders.', ""More than three thirds believe that they are a valid alternative to DBS for some patients, but also almost half of the experts expect that soon there won't be experts who master lesion procedures."", ""Also in the literature there is support to keep lesion procedures as an important alternative for appropriately selected patients both for movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease; Bronstein et al. 2011) and psychiatric disorders (Leiphart and Valone 2010) like OCD or anorexia nervosa (Barbier et al. 2011;D'Astous et al. 2013;Greenberg et al. 2010;Kondziolka et al. 2011)."", 'In particular, an international expert panel has recently stated in a consensus paper that ""until scientifically proven otherwise, DBS is not superior to ablative surgery for psychiatric disorders"" (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2014).', 'However, the main disadvantage of lesion surgery is that possible negative effects are not reversible.', 'Adverse effects that have been reported are the development of undesirable personality traits (after subcaudatetractotomy) and transient mania and memory deficits (after cingulotomy) (Feldman et al. 2001).', 'We also remark that there are research initiatives for additional non-invasive lesion procedures like focused ultrasound (Lipsman et al., 2013b;Jolesz and McDannold 2014) such that novel expertise in ablative surgery may emerge.']",1,"['In particular, an international expert panel has recently stated in a consensus paper that ""until scientifically proven otherwise, DBS is not superior to ablative surgery for psychiatric disorders"" (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2014).']"

This propriety might be used to slow down cognitive decline in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of DBS in AD patients with mild cognitive decline. Inclusion criteria were: patients (<70 years old) with AD diagnosed for less than 2 years, predominant impairment of episodic memory, and Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) score between 20 and 24. The fornix was stimulated bilaterally by electrodes implanted stereotactically in the hypothalamus. Clinical, biological, neuropsychological, and imaging evaluations were conducted 3 months before surgery and 3, 6, and 12 months thereafter. During the one year-period of inclusion, 110 patients with recently diagnosed AD and predominant impairment of episodic memory were screened. Only 9 patients (8.2%) fulfilled all the inclusion criteria. Finally, just one patient accepted to be operated (acceptance rate 11.1%) and completed the study. No complications occurred and the stimulation was perfectly tolerated. After one year of stimulation, the memory scores (MMSE, ADAS-Cog, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test) were stabilized compared to baseline, and mesial temporal lobes metabolism increased. This pilot study provides new data about the safety of fornix DBS in the hypothalamus. However, it suggests that only a small proportion of AD patients might be interested in this approach and that the acceptance of DBS by AD patients was low, raising questions about the relevance of this approach to meet the expectations of these patients.",This tension that may have an influence on DBS exclusion criteria is discussed neither in recent reviews (Hardenacke et al. 2013;Hescham et al. 2013;Laxton and Lozano 2013) nor in case studies (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2013;Laxton et al. 2010) on DBS in Alzheimer's disease.,"['However, only a small minority of experts considers the success probabilities for these diseases to be high.', 'This indicates that societal need partly triggers the expansion of DBS indications.', ""In the case of Alzheimer's disease, it's worthwhile to mention that dementia is considered to be the most common exclusion criteria for DBS in case of PD."", ""This tension that may have an influence on DBS exclusion criteria is discussed neither in recent reviews (Hardenacke et al. 2013;Hescham et al. 2013;Laxton and Lozano 2013) nor in case studies (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2013;Laxton et al. 2010) on DBS in Alzheimer's disease."", 'We identified only one comment that points to potential problems when selecting patients suffering from dementia in clinical DBS trials (Salma et al. 2014).']",1,"[""This tension that may have an influence on DBS exclusion criteria is discussed neither in recent reviews (Hardenacke et al. 2013;Hescham et al. 2013;Laxton and Lozano 2013) nor in case studies (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2013;Laxton et al. 2010) on DBS in Alzheimer's disease.""]"

Methods:ÊRecent literature on the pathophysiology of AD, including translational data and human studies, has been studied to generate a fundamental hypothesis regarding the effects of electrical stimulation on cognition and to facilitate our ongoing pilot study regarding DBS of the nucleus basalis Meynert (NBM) in patients with AD. Results:ÊIt is hypothesized that DBS in the nucleus basalis Meynert could probably improve or at least stabilize memory and cognitive functioning in patients with AD by facilitating neural oscillations and by enhancing the synthesis of nerve growth factors. Conclusions:ÊConsidering the large number of patients suffering from AD, there is a great need for novel and effective treatment methods. Our research provides insights into the theoretical background of DBS in AD. Providing that our hypothesis will be validated by our ongoing pilot study, DBS could be an opportunity in the treatment of AD.",This tension that may have an influence on DBS exclusion criteria is discussed neither in recent reviews (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2013;Hescham et al. 2013;Laxton and Lozano 2013) nor in case studies (Fontaine et al. 2013;Laxton et al. 2010) on DBS in Alzheimer's disease.,"['However, only a small minority of experts considers the success probabilities for these diseases to be high.', 'This indicates that societal need partly triggers the expansion of DBS indications.', ""In the case of Alzheimer's disease, it's worthwhile to mention that dementia is considered to be the most common exclusion criteria for DBS in case of PD."", ""This tension that may have an influence on DBS exclusion criteria is discussed neither in recent reviews (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2013;Hescham et al. 2013;Laxton and Lozano 2013) nor in case studies (Fontaine et al. 2013;Laxton et al. 2010) on DBS in Alzheimer's disease."", 'We identified only one comment that points to potential problems when selecting patients suffering from dementia in clinical DBS trials (Salma et al. 2014).']",1,"[""This tension that may have an influence on DBS exclusion criteria is discussed neither in recent reviews (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2013;Hescham et al. 2013;Laxton and Lozano 2013) nor in case studies (Fontaine et al. 2013;Laxton et al. 2010) on DBS in Alzheimer's disease.""]"

Measurements of the time dependence of solution turbidity, thioflavin T reactivity, and the amount of sedimentable aggregate reveal that the rate and extent of amyloid formation are significantly increased by the addition of an inert polymer, dextran T10, at concentrations exceeding 20 g/liter. High dextran concentrations do not alter the secondary structure of the protein, fiber morphology, or the thioflavin T and Congo Red binding capacity of apoC-II amyloid. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies show that monomeric apoC-II does not associate significantly with dextran. The observed dependence of the overall rate of amyloid formation on dextran concentration may be accounted for quantitatively by a simple model for nonspecific volume exclusion.

The WSP and WIP fractions were analyzed by electron microscopy and their protein contents were determined by a modified Folin phenol reaction. Electron microscopy revealed a complete destruction of the cell organelles due to the strong ostomic shock. Total protein contents of both tissues increased significantly in the old rats and also the WIP contents were much higher in aged animals than in the young and adult ones. Mild heat treatment (64degC, 10 min) or 3 M urea were able to resolubilize a considerable portion of the WIP in the young animals, however, in adults and olds their effect was strongly reduced. Protease inhibitors displayed only a very limited influences on the WIP. The conclusion was reached that a considerable portion of WIP of the old animals may be covalently cross-linked.

To test this hypothesis, two conformationally different amyloid states were produced from the same highly pure recombinant full-length prion protein (rPrP). The cytotoxic potential of intact fibrils and fibrillar fragments generated by sonication from these two states was tested using cultured cells. Methodology/Principal Findings: For one amyloid state, fibril fragmentation was found to enhance its cytotoxic potential, whereas for another amyloid state formed within the same amino acid sequence, the fragmented fibrils were found to be substantially less toxic than the intact fibrils. Consistent with the previous studies, the toxic effects were more pronounced for cell cultures expressing normal isoform of the prion protein (PrP C) at high levels confirming that cytotoxicity was in part PrP C-dependent. Silencing of PrP C expression by small hairpin RNAs designed to silence expression of human PrP C (shRNA-PrP C) deminished the deleterious effects of the two amyloid states to a different extent, suggesting that the role of PrP C-mediated and PrP C-independent mechanisms depends on the structure of the aggregates. Conclusions/Significance: This work provides a direct illustration that the relationship between an amyloid's physical dimension and its toxic potential is not unidirectional but is controlled by the molecular structure of prion protein (PrP) molecules within aggregated states.

Current thinking links a narrow region of the aggregate protein size distribution, the so called 'early aggregate' domain to cellular toxicity. A troubling feature of this theory however is that the nucleated reaction mechanism by which amyloid formation is believed to occur results in a very low number concentration of early aggregates which are rapidly extended to form amyloid fibrils. This situation means that the concentration of early aggregates is very low at the time when they are supposedly at their most toxic. Here we adopt a novel explicit simulation strategy to examine a kinetic regime involving nucleated growth combined with fibril fragmentation under which this situation can be reversed so as to produce a high number concentration of small on-pathway toxic aggregates. Dependent upon the rate of fragmentation, the time scale for generation of toxic early aggregates may be coupled, uncoupled or disassociated from the time scale for the appearance of amyloid fibrils.

The absolute values of the rate constants were established by electron microscopy. Using glycerol, sucrose, or ethylene glycol to vary the solution viscosity, the association rate constant (k+) was 10(7) M-1 s-1 viscosity-1 (in centipoise). Consequently, plots of 1/k+ versus viscosity are linear and extrapolate to near the origin as expected for a diffusion-limited reaction where the rate constant approaches infinity at zero viscosity. By electron microscopy, we found that this inhibitory effect of glycerol is almost entirely at the fast growing, barbed end. For the pointed end, plots of 1/k+ versus viscosity extrapolate to a maximum rate of about 10(6) M-1 s-1 at zero viscosity, so that elongation at the pointed is not limited by diffusion. In contrast to these small molecules, polyethylene glycol, dextran, and ovalbumin all cause a concentration (and therefore viscosity)-dependent increase in k+. At any given viscosity, their effects are similar to each other. For example, at 3 centipoise, k+ = 2.2 X 10(7) M-1 s-1. We presume that this is due to an excluded volume effect that causes an increase in the thermodynamic activity of the actin. If the proteins in the cytoplasmic matrix have a similar effect, the association reactions of actin in cells may be much faster than expected from experiments done in dilute buffers.","More recently, studies carried out in several laboratories [8][9]#AUTHOR_TAG[11][12] revealed that the addition of significant concentrations of functionally unrelated polymers or proteins can greatly accelerate the formation of fibrillar protein aggregates.","['More recently, studies carried out in several laboratories [8][9]#AUTHOR_TAG[11][12] revealed that the addition of significant concentrations of functionally unrelated polymers or proteins can greatly accelerate the formation of fibrillar protein aggregates.', 'A simple model based upon excluded volume theory was shown to quantitatively account for the dependence of the kinetics of amyloid fiber formation upon the concentration of added polymer [10].']",0,"['More recently, studies carried out in several laboratories [8][9]#AUTHOR_TAG[11][12] revealed that the addition of significant concentrations of functionally unrelated polymers or proteins can greatly accelerate the formation of fibrillar protein aggregates.']"

Laurent"", ""Georg F\u00f6lsch"", ""Lars Strid"", ""Olof Mellander"", ""M. Tr\u00e6tteberg""]","Ogston & Phelps (1961) found that hyaluronic acid markedly affects the partition of diffusible macromolecules between solutions of the polysaccharide and buffer. The authors explain the phenomenon as a steric exclusion of macromolecular solutes from solutions containing randomly coiled hyaluronic acid chains. From these results one can expect that hyaluronic acid and similar substances would exert a significant influence on the thermodynamic properties of solutions containing other macromolecules. The investigation reported in the present paper shows that solutions containing both hyaluronic acid and serum albumin have osmotic pressures in excess of the sum of osmotic pressures of solutions containing hyaluronic acid and serum albumin separately at the same concentrations. The influence of the 'effective volume' of a solute of finite concentration on the osmotic pressure of a solution has been treated by a number of authors (see, for example, Scatchard, 1946; Doty & Edsall, 1951; Edsall, 1953; Flory, 1953). Christiansen (1960), using the experimental results of Jensen & Marcker (1958), discussed the phenomenon in hyaluronic acid solutions. All these treatments, however, have been limited to the problem of binary systems containing the solvent and a single species of macromolecules. Ogston (1962) discussed from a theoretical point of view the thermodynamic properties of ternary systems with special reference to buffer solutions containing hyaluronic acid and serum albumin. The study of this problem was approached independently by the present authors. Experimental work was planned and carried out by one of us (T. C. L.) and a theoretical treatment of the thermodynamic properties of systems containing hyaluronic acid and serum albumin was made by the other (Ogston, 1962).

Atha"", ""K.C. Ingham""]","The apparent solubilities of various proteins (14,000 to 670,000 daltons) were measured in the presence of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) of different sizes. All of the solubility curves, determined by measuring the protein concentration in the supernate of centrifuged mixtures, exhibited the characteristic linear dependence of log S (g/liter) on PEG concentration (%, w/v). For human albumin in PEG-4000 at pH 4.5, this linearity extended over a 1,000-fold range of solubility, even though the appearance of the sedimented phase changed from a viscous fluid to a white amorphous solid. The slope, beta, decreased from 0.27 to 0.09 with decreasing Mr of PEG from 20,000 to 400, but was insensitive to changes in solution conditions (pH, T, salts), suggesting the absence of specific chemical interactions between protein and polymer. This conclusion was supported by the observation that concentrations of PEG up to 30% (w/v) had no significant effect on the melting temperature of ribonuclease A. Furthermore, equilibrium dialysis measurements, as well as various spectral measurements, provided no evidence for such interactions. Using a steric exclusion model (Edmond, E., and Ogston, A. G. (1968) Biochem. J. 109, 569-576) and assuming that the chemical potential of the solid phase is constant, beta can be related to interaction coefficients calculated from co-volumes using the equivalent sphere radii of PEG (r2) and protein (r3). Although good agreement was obtained for albumin in PEG-20,000, the predicted dependence of beta on r3 was greater than observed and the predicted dependence of beta on r2 was of opposite direction to that observed. However, the interaction coefficient determined from the equilibrium dialysis measurements of albumin and PEG-1000 agreed with the predicted value. Thus, the exclusion of low concentrations of PEG by albumin can be explained by a simple excluded volume model, whereas the exclusion of protein out of solution by PEG appears to be more complex.","It was shown long ago that the addition of a moderately high concentration of functionally unrelated polymers or proteins can significantly reduce the solubility of a variety of trace proteins [3][4]#AUTHOR_TAG, and quantitative models based upon the concept of excluded volume were shown to account semiquantitatively for the observed dependence of solubility on the concentration of added polymer or protein were introduced [3,4,6,7].","['It was shown long ago that the addition of a moderately high concentration of functionally unrelated polymers or proteins can significantly reduce the solubility of a variety of trace proteins [3][4]#AUTHOR_TAG, and quantitative models based upon the concept of excluded volume were shown to account semiquantitatively for the observed dependence of solubility on the concentration of added polymer or protein were introduced [3,4,6,7].']",0,"['It was shown long ago that the addition of a moderately high concentration of functionally unrelated polymers or proteins can significantly reduce the solubility of a variety of trace proteins [3][4]#AUTHOR_TAG, and quantitative models based upon the concept of excluded volume were shown to account semiquantitatively for the observed dependence of solubility on the concentration of added polymer or protein were introduced [3,4,6,7].']"

We aimed to compare these interventions and to identify which are most effective for the acute treatment of social anxiety disorder in adults. Methods We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of interventions for adults with social anxiety disorder, identified from published and unpublished sources between 1988 and Sept 13, 2013. We analysed interventions by class and individually. Outcomes were validated measures of social anxiety, reported as standardised mean differences (SMDs) compared with a waitlist reference. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012003146. Findings We included 101 trials (13 164 participants) of 41 interventions or control conditions (17 classes) in the analyses. Classes of pharmacological interventions that had greater effects on outcomes compared with waitlist were monoamine oxidase inhibitors (SMD -1*01, 95% credible interval [CrI] -1*56 to -0*45), benzodiazepines (-0*96, -1*56 to -0*36), selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs; -0*91, -1*23 to -0*60), and anticonvulsants (-0*81, -1*36 to -0*28). Compared with waitlist, efficacious classes of psychological interventions were individual cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT; SMD -1*19, 95% CrI -1*56 to -0*81), group CBT (-0*92, -1*33 to -0*51), exposure and social skills (-0*86, -1*42 to -0*29), self-help with support (-0*86, -1*36 to -0*36), self-help without support (-0*75, -1*25 to -0*26), and psychodynamic psychotherapy (-0*62, -0*93 to -0*31). Individual CBT compared with psychological placebo (SMD -0*56, 95% CrI -1*00 to -0*11), and SSRIs and SNRIs compared with pill placebo (-0*44, -0*67 to -0*22) were the only classes of interventions that had greater effects on outcomes than appropriate placebo. Individual CBT also had a greater effect than psychodynamic psychotherapy (SMD -0*56, 95% CrI -1*03 to -0*11) and interpersonal psychotherapy, mindfulness, and supportive therapy (-0*82, -1*41 to -0*24). Interpretation Individual CBT (which other studies have shown to have a lower risk of side-effects than pharmacotherapy) is associated with large effect sizes. Thus, it should be regarded as the best intervention for the initial treatment of social anxiety disorder. For individuals who decline psychological intervention, SSRIs show the most consistent evidence of benefit.

Individuals with a comorbid psychiatric disorder made higher use of some health services than those without a comorbidity. Limitations: analyses were performed post hoc on data collected for other purposes. The defining questions for social phobia have not been studied much before. The number of identified subjects is small and thus raises the possibility of type II errors. Larger numbers may have revealed even more differences from the psychiatrically well population. Data on treatment patterns of the psychiatrically well population were limited because the surveys focused on subjects with psychiatric morbidity. Conclusions: the burden of social phobia on individuals, health services and the wider society could be reduced through improved rates of detection and appropriate treatment","They also incur considerable healthcare costs, especially relating to the use of primary care services, experience high levels of productivity losses and receive higher social benefits compared with people in the general population #AUTHOR_TAG[7][8].","['Social anxiety disorder is one of the most persistent and common anxiety disorders, with a lifetime prevalence estimated to range between 3.9% and 13.7% in Europe [1].', 'People with social anxiety disorder have difficulty forming and retaining personal and social relationships [2], have higher risk of leaving school early and obtaining poorer qualifications [3], experience impairment in their daily functioning including work/school performance and social life [4], and report an important reduction in their quality of life compared with people without the disorder [5].', 'They also incur considerable healthcare costs, especially relating to the use of primary care services, experience high levels of productivity losses and receive higher social benefits compared with people in the general population #AUTHOR_TAG[7][8].', 'It has been shown that as the number of social fears increases, so does health service utilisation [9].', 'The presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders increases usage of health services and productivity losses [6,8,9].']",5,"['Social anxiety disorder is one of the most persistent and common anxiety disorders, with a lifetime prevalence estimated to range between 3.9% and 13.7% in Europe [1].', 'They also incur considerable healthcare costs, especially relating to the use of primary care services, experience high levels of productivity losses and receive higher social benefits compared with people in the general population #AUTHOR_TAG[7][8].', 'It has been shown that as the number of social fears increases, so does health service utilisation [9].']"

METHOD: Adult outpatients with generalized social phobia (N=204) from 10 Canadian centers were randomly assigned to receive sertraline or placebo in a 2:1 ratio for a 20-week double-blind study following a 1-week, single-blind, placebo run-in. The initial dose of sertraline was 50 mg/day with increases of 50 mg/day every 3 weeks permitted after the fourth week of treatment (dosing was flexible up to a maximum of 200 mg/day). Primary efficacy assessments were the percentage of patients rated much or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement item and the mean changes from baseline to study endpoint in total score on the social phobia subscale of the Marks Fear Questionnaire and total score on the Brief Social Phobia Scale. RESULTS: In intent-to-treat endpoint analyses of 203 of the patients, significantly more of the 134 patients given sertraline (N=71 [53%]) than of the 69 patients receiving placebo (N=20 [29%]) were considered responders according to their CGI improvement scores at the end of treatment. The mean reductions in the social phobia subscale of the Marks Fear Questionnaire and in the total score on the Brief Social Phobia Scale were 32.6% and 34.3% in the sertraline group and 10.8% and 18.6% in the placebo group, respectively. Analysis of covariance showed superiority of sertraline over placebo on all primary and secondary efficacy measures. Sertraline was well tolerated: 103 (76%) of the 135 sertraline-treated patients and 54 (78%) of the 69 placebo-treated patients completed the study.

Probabilities of recovery and recurrence were calculated by using standard survival analysis methods. Proportional hazards regression analyses with time-varying covariates were conducted to determine risk ratios for possible comorbid psychiatric predictors of recovery and recurrence.Survival analyses revealed an overall chronic course for the majority of the anxiety disorders. Social phobia had the smallest probability of recovery after 12 years of follow-up. Moreover, patients who had prospectively observed recovery from their intake anxiety disorder had a high probability of recurrence over the follow-up period. The overall clinical course was worsened by several comorbid psychiatric conditions, including major depression and alcohol and other substance use disorders, and by comorbidity of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder with agoraphobia.These data depict the anxiety disorders as insidious, with a chronic clinical course, low rates of recovery, and relatively high probabilities of recurrence. The presence of particular comorbid psychiatric disorders significantly lowered the likelihood of recovery from anxiety disorders and increased the likelihood of their recurrence. The findings add to the understanding of the nosology and treatment of these disorders.","The yearly cycles were considered appropriate and consistent with the slow, chronic course of social anxiety disorder and the low rates of clinical changes in terms of recovery and relapse characterising the disorder #AUTHOR_TAG, and were selected for convenience in terms of applying annual discounting of costs and benefits.","[""During the year post-treatment, people who did not recover remained in the 'social anxiety disorder' state."", ""Those who recovered might relapse, meeting again diagnostic criteria for the disorder, and thus re-enter the 'social anxiety disorder' state."", 'From that point on all people in each cohort entered the Markov model, which was run in yearly cycles.', ""During each cycle people remained in their current health state or moved between the 'no social anxiety disorder' and the 'social anxiety disorder' states."", 'A half-cycle correction was applied.', 'The yearly cycles were considered appropriate and consistent with the slow, chronic course of social anxiety disorder and the low rates of clinical changes in terms of recovery and relapse characterising the disorder #AUTHOR_TAG, and were selected for convenience in terms of applying annual discounting of costs and benefits.']",5,"[""During the year post-treatment, people who did not recover remained in the 'social anxiety disorder' state."", ""Those who recovered might relapse, meeting again diagnostic criteria for the disorder, and thus re-enter the 'social anxiety disorder' state."", 'The yearly cycles were considered appropriate and consistent with the slow, chronic course of social anxiety disorder and the low rates of clinical changes in terms of recovery and relapse characterising the disorder #AUTHOR_TAG, and were selected for convenience in terms of applying annual discounting of costs and benefits.']"

The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ICBT compared to cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) four years post-treatment. We conducted a 4-year follow-up study of participants who had received ICBT or CBGT for SAD within the context of a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial.

Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) has demonstrated efficacy in several trials in recent years. No study has however investigated the cost-effectiveness of ICBT compared to CBGT from a societal perspective, i.e. an analysis where both direct and indirect costs are included. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of ICBT compared to CBGT from a societal perspective using a prospective design. We conducted a randomized controlled trial where participants with SAD were randomized to ICBT (n=64) or CBGT (n=62). Economic data were assessed at pre-treatment, immediately following treatment and six months after treatment. Results showed that the gross total costs were significantly reduced at six-month follow-up, compared to pre-treatment in both treatment conditions. As both treatments were equivalent in reducing social anxiety and gross total costs, ICBT was more cost-effective due to lower intervention costs.

The present relapse prevention study investigated relapse rates during a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period in patients with generalized SAD who had responded to 12-week open-label treatment with escitalopram.   METHOD A total of 517 patients with a primary diagnosis of generalized SAD (per DSM-IV criteria) and a Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) total score of > or = 70 received 12 weeks of open-label treatment with flexible doses (10-20 mg/day) of escitalopram. Of these patients, 371 responded (Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale [CGI-I] score of 1 or 2) and were randomly assigned to 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with escitalo-pram (10 or 20 mg/day) (N = 190) or placebo (N = 181), continuing with the dose level administered at the end of the open-label period. Relapse was defined as either an increase in LSAS total score of > or = 10 or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy, as judged by the investigator. The study was conducted from January 2001 to June 2002.   RESULTS Survival analysis of relapse and time to relapse showed a significant advantage for escitalopram compared to placebo (log-rank test: p < .001). The risk of relapse was 2.8 times higher for placebo-treated patients than for escitalopram-treated patients (p < .001), resulting in significantly fewer escitalopram-treated patients relapsing (22% vs. 50%), at both doses. Escitalopram was well tolerated during double-blind treatment of generalized SAD, and only 2.6% of the escitalopram-treated patients withdrew because of adverse events.

The principal outcome measure was the proportion of patients relapsing during the maintenance phase.   RESULTS Two hundred fifty-seven patients completed the study (136 paroxetine-treated and 121 placebo-treated patients). Significantly fewer patients relapsed in the paroxetine group than in the placebo group (14% vs 39%; odds ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.43; P<.001). At the end of the study, a significantly greater proportion of patients in the paroxetine group showed improvement as shown on the Clinical Global Impression global improvement rating compared with the placebo group (78% vs 51%; odds ratio, 3.66; 95% confidence interval, 2.22-6.04; P<.001). Compared with placebo, paroxetine treatment significantly (P<.001) improved the symptoms of social anxiety as shown on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, Social Phobia Inventory, Sheehan Disability Scale, Symptom Checklist-90 score, and EuroQol visual analogue scale, indicating decreased disability and increased well-being. Paroxetine was well tolerated.

In addition, the correlations of the number of social fears with these domains were studied.Data are from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS) (N = 7,076). Social phobia was assessed according to DSM-III-R with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI); quality of life was assessed according to the Short-Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36).The 12-month prevalence of social phobia was 4.8%. Being female, young, low educated, a single parent, living alone, not having a paid job and having a somatic disorder are associated with 12-month social phobia. Mean and median ages of onset of social phobia were 19.1 and 16.0 years, respectively, and mean and median duration were 16.8 and 14.0 years, respectively. 66% of respondents with social phobia had at least one comorbid condition. 12-month social phobia was significantly related to lower quality of life and higher service utilization. The mean number of feared social situations was 2.73 out of the 6 assessed. As the number of social fears increases, comorbidity and service utilization increases, and the quality of life decreases.These findings suggest as the number of feared social situations increases, the burden of social phobia rises. In other words, like comorbidity or decreased quality of life, the number of social fears is also an important indicator of the severity of social phobia.

Costs were calculated based on health care utilization and lost productivity. Symptom severity was measured with the Liebowitz-Social-Anxiety-Scale; comorbidities were included as covariates.Total 6-month costs were accrued to EUR4802; 23% being direct costs. While there was no significant association with SAD symptom severity for direct costs, costs of absenteeism increased with symptom severity in those with costs >0; comorbid affective disorders and eating disorders had an additional effect. Self-rated productivity was lower with more pronounced symptoms even after controlling for comorbidities.As the study was based on a clinical sample total costs were considered, rather than net costs of SAD and no population costs could be calculated.The burden associated with lost productivity was considerable while costs of healthcare utilization were rather low as most patients had not sought for treatment before. Efforts to identify patients with SAD earlier and to provide adequate treatment should be further increased.

It is difficult to obtain a clear portrayal of the impairment associated with social phobia in community samples. Furthermore, it has been unclear in prior studies to what extent indices were attributable to social phobia as opposed to comorbid major depression. The authors examined relevant data from the Ontario Health Survey Mental Health Supplement. Method:ÊThe Ontario Health Survey Mental Health Supplement, a survey of more than 8,000 residents of Ontario, Canada, aged 15-64, used the University of Michigan Composite International Diagnostic Interview to assign DSM-III-R diagnoses. Several indicators of disability and quality of life were included. The authors compared these indices for persons with and without social phobia and adjusted where indicated for the effects of major depression and relevant sociodemographic factors. Results:ÊPersons with social phobia were impaired on a broad spectrum of measures, ranging from dropping out of school to experiencing disability in one's main activity. They were also significantly more likely than persons without social phobia to rate themselves as ""low functioning"" on the Quality of Well-Being Scale and to report dissatisfaction with many aspects of life. Depressive comorbidity seemed to contribute only modestly to these outcomes. Conclusions:ÊSocial phobia can be a serious, disabling anxiety disorder associated with marked reduction in quality of life. Impairment in social phobia is substantial, even in the absence of comorbid major depression.","People with social anxiety disorder have difficulty forming and retaining personal and social relationships [2], have higher risk of leaving school early and obtaining poorer qualifications [3], experience impairment in their daily functioning including work/school performance and social life [4], and report an important reduction in their quality of life compared with people without the disorder #AUTHOR_TAG.","['Social anxiety disorder is one of the most persistent and common anxiety disorders, with a lifetime prevalence estimated to range between 3.9% and 13.7% in Europe [1].', 'People with social anxiety disorder have difficulty forming and retaining personal and social relationships [2], have higher risk of leaving school early and obtaining poorer qualifications [3], experience impairment in their daily functioning including work/school performance and social life [4], and report an important reduction in their quality of life compared with people without the disorder #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'They also incur considerable healthcare costs, especially relating to the use of primary care services, experience high levels of productivity losses and receive higher social benefits compared with people in the general population [6][7][8].', 'It has been shown that as the number of social fears increases, so does health service utilisation [9].', 'The presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders increases usage of health services and productivity losses [6,8,9].']",0,"['People with social anxiety disorder have difficulty forming and retaining personal and social relationships [2], have higher risk of leaving school early and obtaining poorer qualifications [3], experience impairment in their daily functioning including work/school performance and social life [4], and report an important reduction in their quality of life compared with people without the disorder #AUTHOR_TAG.']"

International collaborative efforts to increase statistical power by combining samples from across sites have been bolstered by the ENIGMA consortium; this provides specific technical expertise for conducting multi-site analyses, as well as access to a collaborative community of neuroimaging scientists. In this article, we outline the background to, development of, and initial findings from ENIGMA's OCD working group, which currently consists of 47 samples from 34 institutes in 15 countries on 5 continents, with a total sample of 2,323 OCD patients and 2,325 healthy controls.

Additional work is ongoing, employing machine learning techniques. Findings to date have contributed to the development of neurobiological models of OCD, have provided an important model of global scientific collaboration, and have had a number of clinical implications.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that persons with psychiatric disorders and perhaps especially social phobia are at increased risk for premature withdrawal from school [Am. J.

In order to further determine the impact of anxiety disorders on school functioning and/or premature withdrawal from school, 201 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for a primary anxiety disorder completed a school leaving questionnaire as well as self-report measures of anxiety, depression, and social adjustment. About 49% (n = 98) reported leaving school prematurely and 24% of those indicated that anxiety was the primary reason for this decision. Patients who had left school prematurely were significantly more likely to have a lifetime diagnosis of generalized social phobia, a past history of alcohol abuse/dependence and a greater number of lifetime diagnoses than those who completed their desired level of education. This study suggests that anxiety disorders, and perhaps especially generalized social phobia, are associated with premature withdrawal from school.

Individuals aged 18 years and over who were not institutionalized were eligible for an in-home computer-assisted interview. Common mental disorders, work loss days (WLD) in the past month and quality of life (QoL) were assessed, using the WMH-2000 version of the CIDI, the WHODAS-II, and the mental and physical component scores (MCS, PCS) of the 12-item short form, respectively. The presence of five chronic physical disorders: arthritis, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes and neurological disease was also assessed. Multivariate regression techniques were used to identify the independent association of mental and physical disorders while controlling for gender, age and country.In each country, WLD and loss of QoL increased with the number of disorders. Most mental disorders had approximately 1.0 SD-unit lower mean MCS and lost three to four times more work days, compared with people without any 12-month mental disorder. The 10 disorders with the highest independent impact on WLD were: neurological disease, panic disorder, PTSD, major depressive episode, dysthymia, specific phobia, social phobia, arthritis, agoraphobia and heart disease. The impact of mental vs. physical disorders on QoL was specific, with mental disorders impacting more on MCS and physical disorders more on PCS. Compared to physical disorders, mental disorders had generally stronger 'cross-domain' effects.The results suggest that mental disorders are important determinants of work role disability and quality of life, often outnumbering the impact of common chronic physical disorders.","_� use of an alternative set of utility scores, based on EQ-5D data [40] derived from a community-based mental health European survey #AUTHOR_TAG.","['_� use of an alternative set of utility scores, based on EQ-5D data [40] derived from a community-based mental health European survey #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'These data reflected a smaller difference in utility between social anxiety disorder and no mental disorder compared with those used in the base-case analysis (this scenario used utility values of 0.79 and 0.91 for social anxiety disorder and no social anxiety disorder, respectively).']",5,"['_� use of an alternative set of utility scores, based on EQ-5D data [40] derived from a community-based mental health European survey #AUTHOR_TAG.']"

Welton"", ""Alex J. Sutton"", ""A. E.

We review synthesis issues that arise on the construction of the baseline natural history model. We cover both the absolute response to treatment on the outcome measures on which comparative effectiveness is defined and the other elements of the natural history model, usually ""downstream"" of the shorter-term effects reported in trials. We recommend that the same framework be used to model the absolute effects of a ""standard treatment"" or placebo comparator as that used for synthesis of relative treatment effects and that the baseline model is constructed independently from the model for relative treatment effects, to ensure that the latter are not affected by assumptions made about the baseline. However, simultaneous modeling of baseline and treatment effects could have some advantages when evidence is very sparse or when other research or study designs give strong reasons for believing in a particular baseline model. The predictive distribution, rather than the fixed effect or random effects mean, should be used to represent the baseline to reflect the observed variation in baseline rates. Joint modeling of multiple baseline outcomes based on data from trials or combinations of trial and observational data is recommended where possible, as this is likely to make better use of available evidence, produce more robust results, and ensure that the model is internally coherent.",This ensured that the full posterior distribution of the relative treatment effects was used to estimate the absolute probabilities of recovery for each treatment #AUTHOR_TAG.,"['The distributions of the probability of recovery for each intervention at end of treatment were defined directly from values recorded in the 10,000 iterations of the NMA.', 'The log-odds of recovery on wait list was assumed to follow a normal distribution.', 'The log-odds ratios of recovery for each treatment relative to wait list were applied to simulated values of this normal distribution and converted onto the probability scale.', 'This ensured that the full posterior distribution of the relative treatment effects was used to estimate the absolute probabilities of recovery for each treatment #AUTHOR_TAG.']",5,['This ensured that the full posterior distribution of the relative treatment effects was used to estimate the absolute probabilities of recovery for each treatment #AUTHOR_TAG.']

One method that has been suggested to represent this uncertainty is the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. This technique, which directly addresses the decision-making problem, has advantages over confidence interval estimation for incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. However, despite these advantages, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves have yet to be widely adopted within the field of economic evaluation of health care technologies. In this paper we consider the relationship between cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and decision-making in health care, suggest the introduction of a new concept more relevant to decision-making, that of the cost-effectiveness frontier, and clarify the use of these techniques when considering decisions involving multiple interventions. We hope that as a result we can encourage the greater use of these techniques.Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","This method of presenting uncertainty has advantages over confidence interval estimation for incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, in particular in comparisons of multiple competing interventions, and presents uncertainty in a format that is more relevant to decision making #AUTHOR_TAG.","['To account for the uncertainty around the input parameter point estimates, a probabilistic analysis was undertaken, in which input parameters were assigned probabilistic distributions [43].', 'Subsequently, 10,000 iterations were performed, each drawing random values out of the distributions fitted onto the model input parameters.', 'Mean costs and QALYs and the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) for each treatment option were calculated by averaging across the 10,000 iterations.', 'The cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier was also plotted; this shows the treatment option with the highest mean NMB over different cost effectiveness thresholds, and the probability that the option with the highest NMB is the most cost-effective among those assessed.', 'This method of presenting uncertainty has advantages over confidence interval estimation for incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, in particular in comparisons of multiple competing interventions, and presents uncertainty in a format that is more relevant to decision making #AUTHOR_TAG.']",5,"['This method of presenting uncertainty has advantages over confidence interval estimation for incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, in particular in comparisons of multiple competing interventions, and presents uncertainty in a format that is more relevant to decision making #AUTHOR_TAG.']"

Other packages or programmes incorporating CCBT were also considered.Electronic databases from 1966 to March 2004. Evidence submitted by sponsors for CCBT products.A systematic review was a review of the literature and the evidence submitted by sponsors for each of the products. A series of cost-effectiveness models was developed and run by the project team for the five CCBT products across the three mental health conditions.Twenty studies were identified in the clinical effectiveness review. The analysis of these results showed some evidence that CCBT is as effective as therapist-led cognitive behaviour therapy (TCBT) for the treatment of depression/anxiety and phobia/panic and is more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) in the treatment of depression/anxiety. CCBT also appears to reduce therapist time compared with TCBT. When reviewing cost-effectiveness studies, only one published economic evaluation of CCBT was found. This was an economic evaluation of the depression software BtB alongside a randomised controlled trial (RCT), which found that BtB was cost-effective against TAU in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (less than 2000 pounds), however it contained weaknesses that were then addressed in the cost-effectiveness model developed for the study. The results of the model for the depression software packages in terms of incremental cost per QALY compared with TAU and the chance of being cost-effective at 30,000 pounds per QALY were for BtB 1801 pounds and 86.8%, for Cope 7139 pounds and 62.6% and for Overcoming Depression 5391 pounds and 54.4%. The strength of the BtB software being that it has been evaluated in the context of an RCT with a control group. The subgroup analysis found no differences across the severity groupings. For phobia/panic software, the model showed an incremental cost per QALY of FF over relaxation was 2380 pounds. Its position compared with TCBT is less clear. When modelling OCD packages, using the practice-level licence cost meant that BT Steps was dominated by TCBT, which had significantly better outcomes and was cheaper. However, the cheaper PCT licence resulted in the incremental cost-effectiveness of BT Steps over relaxation being 15,581 pounds and TCBT over BT Steps being 22,484 pounds.The study findings are subject to substantial uncertainties around the organisational level for purchasing these products and the likely throughput. This is in addition to concerns with the quality of evidence on response to therapy, longer term outcomes and quality of life. The position of CCBT within a stepped care programme needs to be identified, as well as its relationship to other efforts to increase access to CBT and psychological therapies. Research is needed to compare CCBT with other therapies that reduce therapist time, in particular bibliotherapy and to explore the use of CCBT via the Internet. Independent research is needed, particularly RCTs, that examine areas such as patient preference and therapist involvement within primary care.","_� use of an alternative set of utility scores, based on EQ-5D data #AUTHOR_TAG derived from a community-based mental health European survey [46].","['_� use of an alternative set of utility scores, based on EQ-5D data #AUTHOR_TAG derived from a community-based mental health European survey [46].', 'These data reflected a smaller difference in utility between social anxiety disorder and no mental disorder compared with those used in the base-case analysis (this scenario used utility values of 0.79 and 0.91 for social anxiety disorder and no social anxiety disorder, respectively).']",5,"['_� use of an alternative set of utility scores, based on EQ-5D data #AUTHOR_TAG derived from a community-based mental health European survey [46].', 'These data reflected a smaller difference in utility between social anxiety disorder and no mental disorder compared with those used in the base-case analysis (this scenario used utility values of 0.79 and 0.91 for social anxiety disorder and no social anxiety disorder, respectively).']"

An optimal treatment regimen would include a combination of medication and psychotherapy, along with an assertive clinical management program. For medications, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are first-line choices based on their efficacy and tolerability profiles. The nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitor, phenelzine, may be more potent than these two drug classes, but because of its food and drug interaction liabilities, its use should be restricted to patients not responding to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. There are other medication classes with demonstrated efficacy in social phobia (benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, alpha-2-delta ligands), but due to limited published clinical trial data and the potential for dependence and withdrawal issues with benzodiazepines, it is unclear how best to incorporate these drugs into treatment regimens. There are very few clinical trials on the use of combined medications.

Sutton"", ""A. E. Ades"", ""Nicky J. Welton""]","We set out a generalized linear model framework for the synthesis of data from randomized controlled trials. A common model is described, taking the form of a linear regression for both fixed and random effects synthesis, which can be implemented with normal, binomial, Poisson, and multinomial data. The familiar logistic model for meta-analysis with binomial data is a generalized linear model with a logit link function, which is appropriate for probability outcomes. The same linear regression framework can be applied to continuous outcomes, rate models, competing risks, or ordered category outcomes by using other link functions, such as identity, log, complementary log-log, and probit link functions. The common core model for the linear predictor can be applied to pairwise meta-analysis, indirect comparisons, synthesis of multiarm trials, and mixed treatment comparisons, also known as network meta-analysis, without distinction. We take a Bayesian approach to estimation and provide WinBUGS program code for a Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. An advantage of this approach is that it is straightforward to extend to shared parameter models where different randomized controlled trials report outcomes in different formats but from a common underlying model. Use of the generalized linear model framework allows us to present a unified account of how models can be compared using the deviance information criterion and how goodness of fit can be assessed using the residual deviance. The approach is illustrated through a range of worked examples for commonly encountered evidence formats.","Efficacy data were derived from a systematic literature review and NMA of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for adults with social anxiety disorder [14]; the NMA, based on a random effects model #AUTHOR_TAG, was conducted within a Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques implemented in WinBUGS 1.4 [23,24].","['Clinical efficacy.', 'Efficacy data were derived from a systematic literature review and NMA of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for adults with social anxiety disorder [14]; the NMA, based on a random effects model #AUTHOR_TAG, was conducted within a Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques implemented in WinBUGS 1.4 [23,24].', 'The NMA included 101 trials reporting continuous data on symptom scales of social anxiety, of which 24 also reported dichotomous recovery data (with recovery being defined as no longer meeting criteria for diagnosis).', 'The studies reported several continuous measures of social anxiety, none of which were common to all trials, so treatment effects for each trial were calculated as a standardised mean difference (SMD).', 'Based on published psychometric properties and data from clinically referred participants who completed several measures, continuous measures were assumed to be equally responsive and had a mean correlation of 0.65 (for details see [14]).', 'The outcome measures used in the clinical analysis are provided in S1 File.']",5,"['Efficacy data were derived from a systematic literature review and NMA of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for adults with social anxiety disorder [14]; the NMA, based on a random effects model #AUTHOR_TAG, was conducted within a Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques implemented in WinBUGS 1.4 [23,24].']"

However, these earlier meta-analyses also included non-randomized studies, and there are many featured studies in this area which were published after the recent meta-analysis. Method We conducted a systematic literature search and identified 29 randomized studies examining the effects of psychological treatments, with a total of 1628 subjects. The quality of studies varied. For the analyses, we used the computer program comprehensive meta-analysis (version 2.2.021; Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA). Results The mean effect size on social anxiety measures (47 contrast groups) was 0.70, 0.80 on cognitive measures (26 contrast groups) and 0.70 both on depression (19 contrast groups) and general anxiety measures (16 contrast groups). We found some heterogeneity, so we conducted a series of subgroup analyses for different variables of the studies. Studies with waiting-list control groups had significantly larger effect sizes than studies with placebo and treatment-as-usual control groups. Studies aimed at subjects who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria for social anxiety disorder had smaller effect sizes than studies in which other inclusion criteria were used.

We aimed to assess the effects of pharmacotherapy for SAD and to determine whether particular classes of medication are more effective and/or better tolerated than others. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of all published and unpublished placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) undertaken between 1966 and 2007. A rigorous search, which included searching the Cochrane CCDANTR, MEDLINE and PsycINFO electronic databases, yielded a total of 51 RCTs (9914 participants) considered eligible for inclusion in the review. On average, over half of trial participants responded to medication, as assessed with the improvement item of the Clinical Global Impressions scale (55.2%), with approximately four participants having to be treated for an average of 12 weeks before an additional person responded to medication, relative to placebo (number needed to benefit = 4.19). There was substantial variation across medication classes in the number of dropouts due to adverse events, with an average number needed to harm of 14.4. Maintenance and relapse prevention studies confirm the value of longer-term medication in treatment responders. Medication was also effective in reducing SAD symptoms, comorbid depressive symptoms and associated disability. However, evidence for the efficacy of beta-blockers in treating performance anxiety was lacking. Taken together, trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors provide the largest evidence base for agents that are both effective and well tolerated.

Methods:ÊIn a recent study, direct valuations were elicited for 42 EuroQol health states (using the time trade-off method) from a representative sample of the UK population. This article reports on the methodology that was adopted to build up a ""tariff"" of EuroQol values from this data. Results:ÊA parsimonious model that fits the data well was defined as one in which valuations were explained in terms of the level of severity associated with each dimension, an intercept associated with any move away from full health, and a term that picked up whether any dimension in the state was at its most severe level. Conclusions:ÊThe model presented in this article appears to predict the values of the states for which there are direct observations and, thus, can be used to interpolate values for the states for which no direct observations exist.","Following a systematic literature search of utility data for social anxiety disorder, the economic model was populated with utility scores obtained from a Finish national health survey [33] that reported EQ-5D utility scores (estimated using the UK Time Trade-Off Tarrif) #AUTHOR_TAG for people with social anxiety disorder and people with no mental disorder over the last 12 months.","['Utility scores express preferences for different states of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and are necessary for the estimation of QALYs.', 'Following a systematic literature search of utility data for social anxiety disorder, the economic model was populated with utility scores obtained from a Finish national health survey [33] that reported EQ-5D utility scores (estimated using the UK Time Trade-Off Tarrif) #AUTHOR_TAG for people with social anxiety disorder and people with no mental disorder over the last 12 months.', 'The 12-month prevalence of psychiatric disorders in survey participants was assesed using the Munich version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI) [35].', ""Utility scores for people with social anxiety disorder over the previous 12 months were used for the 'social anxiety disorder' state."", ""Utility scores for people with no mental disorder over the last 12 months were used as a proxy for the state of 'no social anxiety disorder', although it is acknowledged that people recovering from social anxiety disorder may not reach the HRQoL of a person without a mental disorder, and thus their HRQoL may have been overestimated, at least over the first few months following recovery.""]",5,"['Utility scores express preferences for different states of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and are necessary for the estimation of QALYs.', 'Following a systematic literature search of utility data for social anxiety disorder, the economic model was populated with utility scores obtained from a Finish national health survey [33] that reported EQ-5D utility scores (estimated using the UK Time Trade-Off Tarrif) #AUTHOR_TAG for people with social anxiety disorder and people with no mental disorder over the last 12 months.']"

Identification of genetic markers has proved difficult, owing to the highly complex and variable nature of the disease. Although autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) arise as a consequence of mutations in genes with multiple molecular functions, they appear to converge on common biological pathways to give rise to autism-relevant behaviors (Abrahams and Geschwind, 2008). One such pathway is the PI3K-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade. The mTOR pathway is a central regulator of cell growth, proliferation, survival, and cap-dependent protein translation. In brain, components of the mTOR pathway are present at synapses, where they regulate dendritic spine morphology, and are essential to synaptogenesis. Growing evidence indicates that dysregulation of mTOR is involved in human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and autism.

Its aetiology is multifactorial with a strong genetic basis. EIF4E is the rate limiting component of eukaryotic translation initiation, and plays a key role in learning and memory through its control of translation within the synapse. EIF4E mediated translation is the final common process modulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), PTEN and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) pathways, which are implicated in autism. Linkage of autism to the EIF4E region on chromosome 4q has been found in genome wide linkage studies.The authors present evidence that directly implicates EIF4E in autism. In a boy with classic autism, the authors observed a de novo chromosome translocation between 4q and 5q and mapped the breakpoint site to within a proposed alternative transcript of EIF4E. They then screened 120 autism families for mutations and found two unrelated families where in each case both autistic siblings and one of the parents harboured the same single nucleotide insertion at position -25 in the basal element of the EIF4E promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and reporter gene studies show that this mutation enhances binding of a nuclear factor and EIF4E promoter activity.These observations implicate EIF4E, and more specifically control of EIF4E activity, directly in autism.

The mutation responsible for FXS is a large expansion of the trinucleotide CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the X-linked gene FMR1.

Recent advances in understanding neural systems that process sensory information, various types of memories and social and emotional behaviors are reviewed and compared with known abnormalities in autism. Then, specific genetic abnormalities that are linked with autism are examined. Synthesis of this information leads to a model that postulates that some forms of autism are caused by an increased ratio of excitation/inhibition in sensory, mnemonic, social and emotional systems.

We used in vivo stereotaxic injections of lentivirus expressing a short hairpin RNA to knock down Pten in mouse neonatal and young adult dentate granule cells. We then assessed the morphology and synaptic physiology between 2 weeks and 4 months later. Confocal imaging of the hippocampus revealed a marked increase in granule cell size and an increase in dendritic spine density. The onset of morphological changes occurred earlier in neonatal mice than in young adults. We used whole-cell recordings from granule cells in acute slices to assess synaptic function after Pten knockdown. Consistent with the increase in dendritic spines, the frequency of excitatory miniature and spontaneous postsynaptic currents increased. However, there was little or no effect on IPSCs. Thus, Pten knockdown results in an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity. Because reductions in Pten affected mature granule cells as well as developing granule cells, we suggest that the disruption of circuit function by Pten hypofunction may be ongoing well beyond early development.","The increased or decreased E/I ratio has been observed in ASD animal models (Chao et al., 2010;Bateup et al., 2011;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011;Schmeisser et al., 2012).","['ASDs (Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003;Bourgeron, 2007;Uhlhaas and Singer, 2012).', 'The increased or decreased E/I ratio has been observed in ASD animal models (Chao et al., 2010;Bateup et al., 2011;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011;Schmeisser et al., 2012).', 'In relation to these E/I shifts, Gkogkas et al then examined the synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices of Eif4ebp2 knockout mice.', 'They found that 4E-BP2 de-repression results in an increased E/I ratio, which can be explained by the increase of vesicular glutamate transporter and spine density in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.', 'As expected, application of eIF4E inhibitor restores the E/I balance (Gkogkas et al., 2013).']",0,"['The increased or decreased E/I ratio has been observed in ASD animal models (Chao et al., 2010;Bateup et al., 2011;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011;Schmeisser et al., 2012).', 'In relation to these E/I shifts, Gkogkas et al then examined the synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices of Eif4ebp2 knockout mice.', 'They found that 4E-BP2 de-repression results in an increased E/I ratio, which can be explained by the increase of vesicular glutamate transporter and spine density in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.']"

Interestingly, genetic elimination of 4E-BP2 converted early-phase LTP to late-phase LTP (L-LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway, likely as a result of increased eIF4F complex formation and translation initiation.

But whereas user-positive externalities are typically mutually imposed and imply mutual benefit because they relate to interoperability, with nonuser-negative externalities the costs of incompatibility may be imposed unilaterally and borne asymmetrically. For example, increased risks of death and injury on the roads due to the co-existence of large and small vehicles are imposed exclusively by the owners of the large vehicles and borne exclusively by the occupants of the small vehicles. This paper compares the social optimality of incentives for compatibility under regimes involving user-positive and nonuser-negative externalities. Earlier work with respect to user-positive externalities (e.g., Katz and Shapiro, 1985) suggests that firms with relatively small networks or weak reputations tend to be biased in favor of compatibility, while individual firmsÕ incentives for compatibility are suboptimal when their networks are closely matched in size. Meanwhile, intuition suggests that with nonuser negative externalities incentives for incompatibility should always be excessive, reflecting the notion that activities involving unilaterally imposed negative externalities will always be overprovided by the market (in the absence of regulation or Coaseian mitigation). Using a ÒlocationÓ model of differentiated products, we find that, under both regimes, incentives for compatibility tend to be suboptimal when firmsÕ networks are close in size, and excessive for the small firm when the networks differ greatly in size.

This fragility is due to a coordination problem among depositors and not to bank competition. Nevertheless, failure perceptions do influence rivalry which in turn affects the failure probability in particular equilibria. Deposit insurance improves welfare by preventing collapse, extending the market, and minimizing frictions. However, deposit insurance also may induce fiercer competition for deposits and increase the deadweight losses associated with failing institutions. The welfare impact of deposit insurance is shown to depend on market structure, and is thus ambiguous even in a world of full liability and no moral hazard in bank investments.

The customers choose their time of purchase to maximize their payoff that depends on their valuation of the product, the purchase price, and the utility they derive from past purchases of others, termed the network effect. We first show that the optimal price sequence is non-decreasing. Therefore, by postponing purchase to future rounds, customers trade-off a higher utility from the network effects with a higher price. We then show that a customer's equilibrium strategy can be characterized by a threshold rule in which at each round a customer purchases the product if and only if her valuation exceeds a certain threshold. This implies that customers face an inference problem regarding the valuations of others, i.e., observing that a customer has not yet purchased the product, signals that her valuation is below a threshold. We consider a block model of network interactions, where there are blocks of buyers subject to the same network effect. A natural benchmark, this model allows us to provide an explicit characterization of the optimal price sequence asymptotically as the number of agents goes to infinity, which notably is linearly increasing in time with a slope that depends on the network effect through a scalar given by the sum of entries of the inverse of the network weight matrix. Our characterization shows that increasing the ""imbalance"" in the network defined as the difference between the in and out degree of the nodes increases the revenue of the monopolist. We further study the effects of price discrimination and show that in earlier periods monopolist offers lower prices to blocks with higher Bonacich centrality to encourage them to purchase, which in turn further incentivizes other customers to buy in subsequent periods","#AUTHOR_TAG (2009), Driskill (2007) and Laussel and Resende (2007) consider forward looking consumers.","['Even within a dynamic model with network effects, consumer expectations can be modeled as myopic or as forward looking.', '#AUTHOR_TAG (2009), Driskill (2007) and Laussel and Resende (2007) consider forward looking consumers.', 'Doganoglu (2003) and Mitchell and Skrzypacz (2006) consider myopic consumers.', 'Radner and Sundararajan (2006) allow for a mixture of forward looking and boundedly rational consumers.']",0,"['Even within a dynamic model with network effects, consumer expectations can be modeled as myopic or as forward looking.', '#AUTHOR_TAG (2009), Driskill (2007) and Laussel and Resende (2007) consider forward looking consumers.', 'Doganoglu (2003) and Mitchell and Skrzypacz (2006) consider myopic consumers.', 'Radner and Sundararajan (2006) allow for a mixture of forward looking and boundedly rational consumers.']"

Lock-in hinders customers from changing suppliers in response to (predictable or unpredictable) changes in efficiency, and gives vendors lucrative ex post market power - over the same buyer in the case of switching costs (or brand loyalty), or over others with network effects. Firms compete ex ante for this ex post power, using penetration pricing, introductory offers, and price wars. Such ""competition for the market"" or ""life-cycle competition"" can adequately replace ordinary compatible competition, and can even be fiercer than compatible competition by weakening differentiation. More often, however, incompatible competition not only involves direct efficiency losses but also softens competition and magnifies incumbency advantages. With network effects, established firms have little incentive to offer better deals when buyers' and complementors' expectations hinge on non-efficiency factors (especially history such as past market shares), and although competition between incompatible networks is initially unstable and sensitive to competitive offers and random events, it later ""tips"" to monopoly, after which entry is hard, often even too hard given incompatibility. And while switching costs can encourage small-scale entry, they discourage sellers from raiding one another's existing customers, and so also discourage more aggressive entry. Because of these competitive effects, even inefficient incompatible competition is often more profitable than compatible competition, especially for dominant firms with installed-base or expectational advantages.

MATTHEWS"", ""BARBARA E. AINSWORTH"", ""RAYMOND W. THOMPSON"", ""DAVID R. BASSETT""]","Purpose: To examine sources of variance in objective measures of physical activity in a group of healthy adults (N = 92) participating in a physical activity measurement study. Methods: Physical activity was assessed for up to 21 consecutive days using the Computer Science Applications (CSA) accelerometer. Day-of-the-week effects were evaluated for activity counts (ct.min(-1).d(-1), ct.d(-1)) and time (min.d(-1)) spent in inactivity (0-499 ct), moderate-1 (500-1951 ct), and moderate-2-vigorous activity (> or =1952 ct). Random effects models were employed to estimate variance components for subject, day of the week, and residual error from which the number of days of assessment required to achieve 80% reliability were estimated. Results: Physical inactivity was lower on weekend days, and Saturday was the least inactive day of the week for both men and women. Inter-individual variation, or differences between subjects, was proportionally the largest source of variance (55-60% of total) in accelerometer counts and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity. Differences within subjects (intra-individual variation) accounted for 30-45% of the overall variance, and day-of-the-week effects accounted for 1-8%. For activity counts, and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity, at least 3-4 d of monitoring were required to achieve 80% reliability. Reliable measures of physical inactivity required at least 7 d of monitoring. Conclusion: These findings provide insight for understanding the behavioral variability in the activity patterns of adults and suggest that reliable measures of activity behaviors require at least 7 d of monitoring.","However, estimates of how many days of monitoring that should be included to obtain a reliable result vary considerably between studies [3-7, 2, 8], and might also vary between outcome variables of interest [#AUTHOR_TAG,8].","['In adults, !3-5 days of monitoring are normally considered appropriate, which is in accordance with recommendations given [2].', 'However, estimates of how many days of monitoring that should be included to obtain a reliable result vary considerably between studies [3-7, 2, 8], and might also vary between outcome variables of interest [#AUTHOR_TAG,8].', 'According to Matthews et al [6], inclusion of more days may be needed to arrive at reliable estimates (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) !0.80) for ""physical inactivity"" (<500 cpm from the Actigraph 7164) (!7 days), compared to PA (! 3-4 days).', 'A comparable finding has been shown in older adults, where 2-3 days was needed for PA, whereas 5 days of monitoring was needed for SED (<50 cpm from the Actigraph 7164).', 'The possible impaired reliability for SED compared to other variables may be of critical importance, given the increased interest in SED in the primary and secondary prevention of a range of chronic diseases as well as premature death [9][10][11].', 'Inconsistent conclusions across studies might amongst other reasons arrive from unreliable measurements of SED, as most of these studies have included !3-5 days of measurement [12][13][14][15][16][17], with some exceptions (!1 day [18]; !6-7 days [19,20]).', 'Moreover, as SED are likely to be related to wear time, correction for wear time might improve reliability.', 'Consistent with this hypothesis, percent SED has previously been shown to be superior to minutes of SED as a predictor of metabolic risk [18].']",4,"['However, estimates of how many days of monitoring that should be included to obtain a reliable result vary considerably between studies [3-7, 2, 8], and might also vary between outcome variables of interest [#AUTHOR_TAG,8].', 'According to Matthews et al [6], inclusion of more days may be needed to arrive at reliable estimates (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) !0.80) for ""physical inactivity"" (<500 cpm from the Actigraph 7164) (!7 days), compared to PA (! 3-4 days).']"

CC786,52129671,Reliability of Objectively Measured Sedentary Time and Physical Activity in Adults,Eivind Aadland,Quantifying Test-Retest Reliability Using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient and the SEM,"[""Joseph P. Weir""]","Reliability, the consistency of a test or measurement, is frequently quantified in the movement sciences literature. A common metric is the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). In addition, the SEM, which can be calculated from the ICC, is also frequently reported in reliability studies. However, there are several versions of the ICC, and confusion exists in the movement sciences regarding which ICC to use. Further, the utility of the SEM is not fully appreciated. In this review, the basics of classic reliability theory are addressed in the context of choosing and interpreting an ICC. The primary distinction between ICC equations is argued to be one concerning the inclusion (equations 2,1 and 2,k) or exclusion (equations 3,1 and 3,k) of systematic error in the denominator of the ICC equation. Inferential tests of mean differences, which are performed in the process of deriving the necessary variance components for the calculation of ICC values, are useful to determine if systematic error is present. If so, the measurement schedule should be modified (removing trials where learning and/or fatigue effects are present) to remove systematic error, and ICC equations that only consider random error may be safely used. The use of ICC values is discussed in the context of estimating the effects of measurement error on sample size, statistical power, and correlation attenuation. Finally, calculation and application of the SEM are discussed. It is shown how the SEM and its variants can be used to construct confidence intervals for individual scores and to determine the minimal difference needed to be exhibited for one to be confident that a true change in performance of an individual has occurred.","Additionally, ICC is the variance partitioning of subjects to the total variance, thus ICC is a relative and context-specific estimate that depends on the heterogeneity of the sample [26][27]#AUTHOR_TAG.","['Historically, sedentary behavior (SED) was conceptualized as the lower end of the PA spectrum, as opposed to moderate-to vigorous PA (MVPA), but is now increasingly being viewed as a behavior distinct from PA, defined as waking behavior characterized by an energy expenditure 1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) [21].', 'Although somewhat arbitrary, studies using Actigraph instruments mainly operationalize SED as the time spent <100 cpm.', 'This cutoff differs substantially from that used to define ""inactivity"" (<500 cpm) applied by Matthews et al [6].', 'Thus, besides the study of reliability of SED in older adults [8], to the best of our knowledge, reliability of SED obtained by accelerometry have not been investigated in adults, and should be prioritized [22].', 'Furthermore, no studies have determined the intra-individual week-by-week agreement of accelerometer outcomes using absolute measures of reliability (i.e., standard error of the measurement and limits of agreement).', 'Most evidence suggest that a reliability of !0.70-0.80 are achieved for PA with 3-7 days of monitoring by estimation of the number of days needed based on the Spearman Brown prophecy formula, when measurements are conducted over a single 7-day period [5-7, 2, 8].', 'However, such study designs have received critique for possibly leaving to optimistic results and should be interpreted with caution [23][24][25].', 'First, the results are in principle only generalizable to the included days, as inclusion of additional days, weeks or seasons will add variability.', 'Secondly, the assumption of compound symmetry (i.e., similar variances and co-variances) across days of measurement might not be fulfilled.', 'Additionally, ICC is the variance partitioning of subjects to the total variance, thus ICC is a relative and context-specific estimate that depends on the heterogeneity of the sample [26][27]#AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Thus, research targeting agreement of SED and PA measurements by means of absolute measures of reliability, which allow for a direct quantification of how much outcomes vary over time independent of the variability of observations should be given priority.']",5,"['Additionally, ICC is the variance partitioning of subjects to the total variance, thus ICC is a relative and context-specific estimate that depends on the heterogeneity of the sample [26][27]#AUTHOR_TAG.']"

While this important research has been completed in young to middle-aged adults, data is lacking in older adults. Further, data determining the number of days of self-reports PA data is also void. The purpose of this study was to examine the number of days needed to predict habitual PA and sedentary behaviour across pedometer, accelerometer, and physical activity log (PA log) data in older adults. Methods Participants (52 older men and women; age = 69.3 +- 7.4 years, range= 55-86 years) wore a Yamax Digiwalker SW-200 pedometer and an ActiGraph 7164 accelerometer while completing a PA log for 21 consecutive days. Mean differences each instrument and intensity between days of the week were examined using separate repeated measures analysis of variance for with pairwise comparisons. Spearman-Brown Prophecy Formulae based on Intraclass Correlations of .80, .85, .90 and .95 were used to predict the number of days of accelerometer or pedometer wear or PA log daily records needed to represent total PA, light PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA, and sedentary behaviour. Results Results of this study showed that three days of accelerometer data, four days of pedometer data, or four days of completing PA logs are needed to accurately predict PA levels in older adults. When examining time spent in specific intensities of PA, fewer days of data are needed for accurate prediction of time spent in that activity for ActiGraph but more for the PA log. To accurately predict average daily time spent in sedentary behaviour, five days of ActiGraph data are needed. Conclusions The number days of objective (pedometer and ActiGraph) and subjective (PA log) data needed to accurately estimate daily PA in older adults was relatively consistent. Despite no statistical differences between days for total PA by the pedometer and ActiGraph, the magnitude of differences between days suggests that day of the week cannot be completely ignored in the design and analysis of PA studies that involve < 7-day monitoring protocols for these instruments. More days of accelerometer data were needed to determine typical sedentary behaviour than PA level in this population of older adults.</p","However, estimates of how many days of monitoring that should be included to obtain a reliable result vary considerably between studies [3-7, 2, #AUTHOR_TAG], and might also vary between outcome variables of interest [6,#AUTHOR_TAG].","['In adults, !3-5 days of monitoring are normally considered appropriate, which is in accordance with recommendations given [2].', 'However, estimates of how many days of monitoring that should be included to obtain a reliable result vary considerably between studies [3-7, 2, #AUTHOR_TAG], and might also vary between outcome variables of interest [6,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'According to Matthews et al [6], inclusion of more days may be needed to arrive at reliable estimates (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) !0.80) for ""physical inactivity"" (<500 cpm from the Actigraph 7164) (!7 days), compared to PA (! 3-4 days).', 'A comparable finding has been shown in older adults, where 2-3 days was needed for PA, whereas 5 days of monitoring was needed for SED (<50 cpm from the Actigraph 7164).', 'The possible impaired reliability for SED compared to other variables may be of critical importance, given the increased interest in SED in the primary and secondary prevention of a range of chronic diseases as well as premature death [9][10][11].', 'Inconsistent conclusions across studies might amongst other reasons arrive from unreliable measurements of SED, as most of these studies have included !3-5 days of measurement [12][13][14][15][16][17], with some exceptions (!1 day [18]; !6-7 days [19,20]).', 'Moreover, as SED are likely to be related to wear time, correction for wear time might improve reliability.', 'Consistent with this hypothesis, percent SED has previously been shown to be superior to minutes of SED as a predictor of metabolic risk [18].']",1,"['However, estimates of how many days of monitoring that should be included to obtain a reliable result vary considerably between studies [3-7, 2, #AUTHOR_TAG], and might also vary between outcome variables of interest [6,#AUTHOR_TAG].', 'According to Matthews et al [6], inclusion of more days may be needed to arrive at reliable estimates (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) !0.80) for ""physical inactivity"" (<500 cpm from the Actigraph 7164) (!7 days), compared to PA (! 3-4 days).', 'A comparable finding has been shown in older adults, where 2-3 days was needed for PA, whereas 5 days of monitoring was needed for SED (<50 cpm from the Actigraph 7164).']"

We also discuss the various options related to distributing and collecting monitors and strategies to enhance compliance with the monitoring protocol.No definitive evidence exists currently to indicate that one make and model of accelerometer is more valid and reliable than another. Selection of accelerometer therefore remains primarily an issue of practicality, technical support, and comparability with other studies. Studies employing multiple accelerometers to estimate energy expenditure report only marginal improvements in explanatory power. Accelerometers are best placed on hip or the lower back. Although the issue of epoch length has not been studied in adults, the use of count cut points based on 1-min time intervals maybe inappropriate in children and may result in underestimation of physical activity. Among adults, 3-5 d of monitoring is required to reliably estimate habitual physical activity. Among children and adolescents, the number of monitoring days required ranges from 4 to 9 d, making it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion for this population. Face-to-face distribution and collection of accelerometers is probably the best option in field-based research, but delivery and return by express carrier or registered mail is a viable option.Accelerometer-based activity assessments requires careful planning and the use of appropriate strategies to increase compliance.","In adults, !3-5 days of monitoring are normally considered appropriate, which is in accordance with recommendations given #AUTHOR_TAG.","['In adults, !3-5 days of monitoring are normally considered appropriate, which is in accordance with recommendations given #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'However, estimates of how many days of monitoring that should be included to obtain a reliable result vary considerably between studies [3-7, 2, 8], and might also vary between outcome variables of interest [6,8].', 'According to Matthews et al [6], inclusion of more days may be needed to arrive at reliable estimates (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) !0.80) for ""physical inactivity"" (<500 cpm from the Actigraph 7164) (!7 days), compared to PA (! 3-4 days).', 'A comparable finding has been shown in older adults, where 2-3 days was needed for PA, whereas 5 days of monitoring was needed for SED (<50 cpm from the Actigraph 7164).', 'The possible impaired reliability for SED compared to other variables may be of critical importance, given the increased interest in SED in the primary and secondary prevention of a range of chronic diseases as well as premature death [9][10][11].', 'Inconsistent conclusions across studies might amongst other reasons arrive from unreliable measurements of SED, as most of these studies have included !3-5 days of measurement [12][13][14][15][16][17], with some exceptions (!1 day [18]; !6-7 days [19,20]).', 'Moreover, as SED are likely to be related to wear time, correction for wear time might improve reliability.', 'Consistent with this hypothesis, percent SED has previously been shown to be superior to minutes of SED as a predictor of metabolic risk [18].']",1,"['In adults, !3-5 days of monitoring are normally considered appropriate, which is in accordance with recommendations given #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'However, estimates of how many days of monitoring that should be included to obtain a reliable result vary considerably between studies [3-7, 2, 8], and might also vary between outcome variables of interest [6,8].', 'According to Matthews et al [6], inclusion of more days may be needed to arrive at reliable estimates (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) !0.80) for ""physical inactivity"" (<500 cpm from the Actigraph 7164) (!7 days), compared to PA (! 3-4 days).', 'A comparable finding has been shown in older adults, where 2-3 days was needed for PA, whereas 5 days of monitoring was needed for SED (<50 cpm from the Actigraph 7164).']"

Methods: We present a narrative overview of the sedentary behaviour measurement literature. Subjective and objective methods of measuring sedentary behaviour suitable for use in population-based research with children and adults are examined. The validity and reliability of each method is considered, gaps in the literature specific to each method identified and potential future directions discussed. Results: To date, subjective approaches to sedentary behaviour measurement, e.g. questionnaires, have focused predominantly on TV viewing or other screen-based behaviours. Typically, such measures demonstrate moderate reliability but slight to moderate validity. Accelerometry is increasingly being used for sedentary behaviour assessments; this approach overcomes some of the limitations of subjective methods, but detection of specific postures and postural changes by this method is somewhat limited. Instruments developed specifically for the assessment of body posture have demonstrated good reliability and validity in the limited research conducted to date. Miniaturization of monitoring devices, interoperability between measurement and communication technologies and advanced analytical approaches are potential avenues for future developments in this field. Conclusions: High-quality measurement is essential in all elements of sedentary behaviour epidemiology, from determining associations with health outcomes to the development and evaluation of behaviour change interventions.

We aimed to compare the cardiometabolic risk factor dose-response relationships for physical activity and sedentary behaviour between accelerometer- and questionnaire-based activity measures.Physical activity and sedentary behaviour were assessed in 317 adults by 7-day accelerometry and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Fasting blood was taken to determine insulin, glucose, triglyceride and total, LDL and HDL cholesterol concentrations and homeostasis model-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA(IR)). Waist circumference, BMI, body fat percentage and blood pressure were also measured.For both accelerometer-derived sedentary time (50% lower for the IPAQ-reported compared to the accelerometer-derived measure (p<0.0001 for both interactions). The relationships for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and risk factors were less strong than those observed for sedentary behaviours, but significant negative relationships were observed for both accelerometer and IPAQ MVPA measures with glucose, and insulin and HOMA(IR) values (all p<0.05). For accelerometer-derived MVPA only, additional negative relationships were seen with triglyceride, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations, BMI, waist circumference and percentage body fat, and a positive relationship was evident with HDL cholesterol (p = 0.0002). Regression coefficients for HOMA(IR), insulin and triglyceride were 43-50% lower for the IPAQ-reported compared to the accelerometer-derived MVPA measure (all p<=0.01).Using the IPAQ to determine sitting time and MVPA reveals some, but not all, relationships between these activity measures and metabolic and vascular disease risk factors.

CC795,52129671,Reliability of Objectively Measured Sedentary Time and Physical Activity in Adults,Eivind Aadland,Measures of Reliability in Sports Medicine and Science,"[""Will G. Hopkins""]","Abstract Reliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test, assay or other meas-urement in repeated trials on the same individuals. Better reliability implies better precision of single measurements and better tracking of changes in measurements in research or practical settings. The main measures of reliability are within-subject random variation, systematic change in the mean, and retest correlation. Asimple, adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical (standard) error of meas-urement: the standard deviation of an individual's repeated measurements. For many measurements in sports medicine and science, the typical error is best expressed as a coefficient of variation (percentage of the mean). A biased, more limited form of within-subject variation is the limits of agreement: the 95 % likely range of change of an individual's measurements between 2 trials. Systematic changes in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent such effects as learning, motivation or fatigue; these changes need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject variation. Retest correlation is difficult to inter-pret, mainly because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the sample of participants. Uses of reliability include decision-making when monitoring indi-viduals, comparison of tests or equipment, estimation of sample size in experi-ments and estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the response to a treatment. Reasonable precision for estimates of reliability requires approx-imately 50 study participants and at least 3 trials. Studies aimed at assessing variation in reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly. A wider understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error as the standard measure of reliability would improve the assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines","Additionally, ICC is the variance partitioning of subjects to the total variance, thus ICC is a relative and context-specific estimate that depends on the heterogeneity of the sample #AUTHOR_TAG[27][28].","['Historically, sedentary behavior (SED) was conceptualized as the lower end of the PA spectrum, as opposed to moderate-to vigorous PA (MVPA), but is now increasingly being viewed as a behavior distinct from PA, defined as waking behavior characterized by an energy expenditure 1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) [21].', 'Although somewhat arbitrary, studies using Actigraph instruments mainly operationalize SED as the time spent <100 cpm.', 'This cutoff differs substantially from that used to define ""inactivity"" (<500 cpm) applied by Matthews et al [6].', 'Thus, besides the study of reliability of SED in older adults [8], to the best of our knowledge, reliability of SED obtained by accelerometry have not been investigated in adults, and should be prioritized [22].', 'Furthermore, no studies have determined the intra-individual week-by-week agreement of accelerometer outcomes using absolute measures of reliability (i.e., standard error of the measurement and limits of agreement).', 'Most evidence suggest that a reliability of !0.70-0.80 are achieved for PA with 3-7 days of monitoring by estimation of the number of days needed based on the Spearman Brown prophecy formula, when measurements are conducted over a single 7-day period [5-7, 2, 8].', 'However, such study designs have received critique for possibly leaving to optimistic results and should be interpreted with caution [23][24][25].', 'First, the results are in principle only generalizable to the included days, as inclusion of additional days, weeks or seasons will add variability.', 'Secondly, the assumption of compound symmetry (i.e., similar variances and co-variances) across days of measurement might not be fulfilled.', 'Additionally, ICC is the variance partitioning of subjects to the total variance, thus ICC is a relative and context-specific estimate that depends on the heterogeneity of the sample #AUTHOR_TAG[27][28].', 'Thus, research targeting agreement of SED and PA measurements by means of absolute measures of reliability, which allow for a direct quantification of how much outcomes vary over time independent of the variability of observations should be given priority.']",5,"['Additionally, ICC is the variance partitioning of subjects to the total variance, thus ICC is a relative and context-specific estimate that depends on the heterogeneity of the sample #AUTHOR_TAG[27][28].', 'Thus, research targeting agreement of SED and PA measurements by means of absolute measures of reliability, which allow for a direct quantification of how much outcomes vary over time independent of the variability of observations should be given priority.']"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data were from 1,367 men and women, aged ³60 years who participated in the 2003Ð2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Sedentary time during waking hours was measured by an accelerometer (<100 counts per minute). A sedentary bout was defined as a period of time >5 min. A sedentary break was defined as an interruption in sedentary time (³100 counts per minute). Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria. RESULTS On average, people spent 9.5 h (65% of wear time) as sedentary. Compared with people without metabolic syndrome, people with metabolic syndrome spent a greater percentage of time as sedentary (67.3 vs. 62.2%), had longer average sedentary bouts (17.7 vs. 16.7 min), had lower intensity during sedentary time (14.8 vs. 15.8 average counts per minute), and had fewer sedentary breaks (82.3 vs. 86.7), adjusted for age and sex (all P < 0.01). A higher percentage of time sedentary and fewer sedentary breaks were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of metabolic syndrome after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, education, alcohol consumption, smoking, BMI, diabetes, heart disease, and physical activity. The association between intensity during sedentary time and metabolic syndrome was borderline significant. CONCLUSIONS The proportion of sedentary time was strongly related to metabolic risk, independent of physical activity. Current results suggest older people may benefit from reducing total sedentary time and avoiding prolonged periods of sedentary time by increasing the number of breaks during sedentary time.","Inconsistent conclusions across studies might amongst other reasons arrive from unreliable measurements of SED, as most of these studies have included !3-5 days of measurement [12][13][14][15][16][17], with some exceptions (!1 day #AUTHOR_TAG; !6-7 days [19,20]).","['In adults, !3-5 days of monitoring are normally considered appropriate, which is in accordance with recommendations given [2].', 'However, estimates of how many days of monitoring that should be included to obtain a reliable result vary considerably between studies [3-7, 2, 8], and might also vary between outcome variables of interest [6,8].', 'According to Matthews et al [6], inclusion of more days may be needed to arrive at reliable estimates (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) !0.80) for ""physical inactivity"" (<500 cpm from the Actigraph 7164) (!7 days), compared to PA (! 3-4 days).', 'A comparable finding has been shown in older adults, where 2-3 days was needed for PA, whereas 5 days of monitoring was needed for SED (<50 cpm from the Actigraph 7164).', 'The possible impaired reliability for SED compared to other variables may be of critical importance, given the increased interest in SED in the primary and secondary prevention of a range of chronic diseases as well as premature death [9][10][11].', 'Inconsistent conclusions across studies might amongst other reasons arrive from unreliable measurements of SED, as most of these studies have included !3-5 days of measurement [12][13][14][15][16][17], with some exceptions (!1 day #AUTHOR_TAG; !6-7 days [19,20]).', 'Moreover, as SED are likely to be related to wear time, correction for wear time might improve reliability.', 'Consistent with this hypothesis, percent SED has previously been shown to be superior to minutes of SED as a predictor of metabolic risk [18].']",0,"['Inconsistent conclusions across studies might amongst other reasons arrive from unreliable measurements of SED, as most of these studies have included !3-5 days of measurement [12][13][14][15][16][17], with some exceptions (!1 day #AUTHOR_TAG; !6-7 days [19,20]).', 'Moreover, as SED are likely to be related to wear time, correction for wear time might improve reliability.', 'Consistent with this hypothesis, percent SED has previously been shown to be superior to minutes of SED as a predictor of metabolic risk [18].']"

JEROME"", ""DEBORAH ROHM YOUNG"", ""DAN LAFERRIERE"", ""CHUHE CHEN"", ""WILLIAM M. VOLLMER""]","Accurate and reliable measurement of physical activity plays an important role in assessing effective lifestyle interventions for obesity. This study examined reliability of accelerometer-based estimates of physical activity levels of overweight and obese adults before and after a lifestyle weight loss program.Participants were overweight and obese (body mass index = 25-45 kg x m) members (n = 1592; 67% female, 42% African American) of the multicenter weight loss maintenance trial. They wore RT3 accelerometers during waking hours for 7 d at baseline and after a 6-month weight loss intervention that included diet and physical activity recommendations. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and MVPA occurring in bouts >or=10 min (bout MVPA) were assessed.At baseline, wear time minimums of 10 and 6 h.d resulted in similar average minutes per day of MVPA (18.3 and 18.0 min) and MVPA bout minutes per day (6.9 and 6.7 min). Similar wear times occurred after the weight loss intervention for MVPA (27.0 and 26.8 min) and bout MVPA (15.1 and 15.0 min). Reliability measurements by intraclass correlation (ICC) were larger for 4 versus 2 d x wk minimum wear time for both MVPA and bout MVPA (4-d ICC = 0.27-0.44 and 2-d ICC = 0.19-0.38), but there was little increase in ICC comparing 4 (ICC = 0.27-0.44) and 7 d x wk (ICC = 0.30-0.46).Longer wear time requirements did not result in significant increases in reliability. Using 4 d of data with >or=6 h x d of wear time optimized the balance between ICC and participant burden in overweight and obese adults before and after a weight loss intervention. Future investigations using accelerometers to estimate MVPA in overweight and obese samples can consider requiring less monitor wear time.","While several studies have found that 2-6 days are required [5,7,8,6,30], other studies have shown that 12 [4] and 16-23 days are needed #AUTHOR_TAG.","['The present estimates of number of days needed to achieve a reliability of ICC = 0.80 for overall PA and MVPA, fall in between of previous estimates.', 'While several studies have found that 2-6 days are required [5,7,8,6,30], other studies have shown that 12 [4] and 16-23 days are needed #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Jerome et al [3] used a wear time criteria of !6 h, which might have led to the need for many days of measurement, in line with the trend across the wear time criteria applied in the present study.', 'Levin et al [4] applied a protocol with measurements during an entire year, which may have introduced greater variation (e.g., seasonal effects) than across subsequent days and weeks.', 'Nevertheless, as ICC is based on variance partitioning and depends on the relative difference in variances (inter-vs.', 'intra-individual sources of variance), the coefficient is context-specific.', 'Thus, it change with the range of observations (similar to the correlation coefficient), despite residual variance and absolute measures of reliability being unaffected [26][27][28].', 'The current sample was a convenience sample exhibiting a higher activity level (but with approximately similar heterogeneity as evaluated by SDs for the different outcome variables) as compared to population estimates for the corresponding age group [34][35][36].', 'Thus, it could be argued that our estimates of ICC might be fairly generalizable to the general adult population.', 'Yet, previous studies have concluded that it does not seem to be any relationship between activity level and reliability [6,4].', 'Based on the heteroscedastic patterns of variability found for overall PA level and MVPA (Fig 1), the current study indicates otherwise.', 'Thus, the sample characteristics (exhibiting a high PA level) might be a likely explanation for the lower reliability found for PA compared to other studies.', 'This means that researchers should determine reliability in their specific samples to make appropriate decisions on valid wear criteria in a given study.', 'Yet, it could be hypothesized from the current study that SED are less influenced by sample characteristics than PA, as a homoscedastic pattern was evident for SED as opposed to the heteroscedastic pattern found for PA.']",1,"['The present estimates of number of days needed to achieve a reliability of ICC = 0.80 for overall PA and MVPA, fall in between of previous estimates.', 'While several studies have found that 2-6 days are required [5,7,8,6,30], other studies have shown that 12 [4] and 16-23 days are needed #AUTHOR_TAG.', 'Jerome et al [3] used a wear time criteria of !6 h, which might have led to the need for many days of measurement, in line with the trend across the wear time criteria applied in the present study.', 'Levin et al [4] applied a protocol with measurements during an entire year, which may have introduced greater variation (e.g., seasonal effects) than across subsequent days and weeks.', 'Nevertheless, as ICC is based on variance partitioning and depends on the relative difference in variances (inter-vs.', 'intra-individual sources of variance), the coefficient is context-specific.', 'Thus, it change with the range of observations (similar to the correlation coefficient), despite residual variance and absolute measures of reliability being unaffected [26][27][28].', 'The current sample was a convenience sample exhibiting a higher activity level (but with approximately similar heterogeneity as evaluated by SDs for the different outcome variables) as compared to population estimates for the corresponding age group [34][35][36].', 'Thus, it could be argued that our estimates of ICC might be fairly generalizable to the general adult population.', 'Yet, previous studies have concluded that it does not seem to be any relationship between activity level and reliability [6,4].', 'Based on the heteroscedastic patterns of variability found for overall PA level and MVPA (Fig 1), the current study indicates otherwise.', 'Thus, the sample characteristics (exhibiting a high PA level) might be a likely explanation for the lower reliability found for PA compared to other studies.', 'This means that researchers should determine reliability in their specific samples to make appropriate decisions on valid wear criteria in a given study.', 'Yet, it could be hypothesized from the current study that SED are less influenced by sample characteristics than PA, as a homoscedastic pattern was evident for SED as opposed to the heteroscedastic pattern found for PA.']"
